THE BACCHAE
By Euripides
Translated by Ian Johnston
Editing/Staging by Stephen A. Schrum
[Scene: The Greek city of Thebes, 
outside the royal palace.]
PROLOGUE
[Dionysus teleports in and appears, 
hovering, above the center of the 
Orchestra. His appearance is that
of a young man. He is alone, with the 
palace behind him, its main doors 
facing the audience. He speaks
directly to the audience]
DIONYSUS: I, Dionysus, son of Zeus,
Have come to Thebes, city of Greeks,
only after I've set the eastern lands
dancing in the mysteries I established,
making known to men my own divinity.
Thebes is the first city of the Greeks
where I've roused people to shout out 
my cries,
with this deerskin draped around my 
body,
this ivy spear, a thyrsus, in my hand.
For my mother's sisters have acted 
badly,
something they, of all people, should 
avoid.
They boasted aloud that I, Dionysus,
was no child of Zeus, claiming Semele,
once she was pregnant by some mortal 
man,
attributed her bad luck in bed to Zeus,
a story made up (they said) to trick 
Cadmus.
So I've driven those women from their 
homes
in a frenzy-they now live in the 
mountains,
out of their minds. I've made them put 
on costumes,
outfits appropriate for my mysteries.
All Theban offspring-or, at least, all 
women-
I've driven in a crazed fit from their 
homes.
Now they sit out there among the rocks,
underneath green pine trees, no roof 
overhead,
Cadmus' daughters in their company as 
well.
For this city has to learn, that it has 
yet to be initiated
into my Dionysian rites. Here I plead
the cause of my own mother, Semele,
appearing as a god to mortal men,
the one she bore to Zeus. Now Cadmus,
the old king, has just transferred his 
power,
his royal authority, to Pentheus,
his daughter's son, who, in my case at 
least,
fights against the gods, prohibiting me
all sacrificial offerings. When he 
prays,
he chooses to ignore me. For this 
neglect

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

I'll demonstrate to him, to all in 
Thebes,
that I was born a god.
But if Thebans in this city, in their 
anger,
try to make those Bacchic women leave,
to drive them from the mountains 
forcibly,
then I, commander of these Maenads,
will fight them. That's why I've 
transformed myself,
assumed a mortal shape, altered my 
looks,
so I resemble any human being.
PARADOS
[Music. Enter the Chorus Leader of the 
Bacchae, dressed in a ritual deerskin, 
carrying a small drum like
a tambourine. She enters from the SL 
parados.]
DIONYSUS: But you there:
beat yours drum by Pentheus' palace,
let Cadmus' city see you, while I go,
in person, to the clefts of Mount 
Cithaeron,
to my Bacchae, to join their dancing.
[Exit Dionysus, teleporting away to 
backstage. The Chorus Leader crosses to 
the center of the orchestra
and dances as we hear the Chorus on the 
audio stream]
FIRST VOICE: Sweet and easy task,
to cry out in celebration,
hailing great god Bacchus.
SECOND VOICE: Let every mouth be pure.
In my hymn I celebrate
our old eternal custom,
hailing Dionysus.
THIRD VOICE: O, blessed is the man,
the fortunate man who knows
the rituals of the gods,
who leads a pious life,
whose spirit merges
with these Bacchic celebrations,
frenzied dancing in the mountains,
our purifying rites.
FIRST VOICE: His mother dropped him 
early,
as her womb, in forceful birth pangs,
was struck by Zeus' flying lightning 
bolt,
a blast which took her life.
Then Zeus, son of Cronos,
at once hid him away,
concealed from Hera.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

SECOND VOICE: Fates made him perfect.
Then Zeus gave birth to him,
the god with ox's horns,
crowned with wreaths of snakes-
that's why the Maenads
twist in their hair
wild snakes they capture.
THIRD VOICE: O Thebes, nursemaid of 
Semele,
put on your ivy crown.
Consecrate yourselves to Bacchus.
Dress yourselves in spotted fawn skins,
trimmed with white sheep's wool.
As you wave your thyrsus,
revere the violence it contains.
All the earth will dance at once.
FIRST VOICE: He's welcome in the 
mountains,
when he sinks down to the ground,
after the running dance,
hunting the goat's blood,
blood of the slain beast,
devouring its raw flesh with joy,
rushing off into the mountains,
leading the dance-
Bromius-Evoe!
ALL VOICES: Evoe!
The land flows with milk,
the land flows with wine,
the land flows with honey from the bees.
He holds the torch high,
our leader, the Bacchic One,
blazing flame of pine,
sweet smoke like Syrian incense,
trailing from his thyrsus.
As he dances, he runs,
here and there,
rousing the stragglers,
stirring them with his cries.
Among the Maenads' shouts
his voice reverberates:
"On Bacchants, on!"

EPISODE 1
[Enter Tiresias, from the SR parados. 
He is a very old blind man, dressed in 
clothing appropriate for the
Dionysian ritual. He crosses to the 
middle door of the skene and knocks 
very aggressively. The Chorus
Leader crosses to the extreme DS edge 
of the orchestra.]
TIRESIAS: [shouting] You in there,
tell Cadmus to get himself out of the 
house!
Go tell him Tiresias is waiting for him.
He knows well enough why I've come for 
him.
I'm an old man, and he's even older,
but we've agreed make ourselves a 
thyrsus,
to put on fawn skins and crown our heads
with garlands of these ivy branches.
[Enter Cadmus from the center door of 
the skene, a very old man, also dressed 
in clothing appropriate
for the Dionysian ritual.]
CADMUS: My dearest friend,
I was inside the house. I heard your 
voice.
I recognized it-the voice of a man 
truly wise.
So I've come equipped with all this god 
stuff.
[He crosses to the orchestra]
We must sing his praise, as much as we 
can.
Dionysus has revealed himself a god to 
men.
Where must I go and dance? Where do I 
get
to move my feet and shake my old gray 
head?
You must guide me, Tiresias, one old man
leading another, for you're the expert 
here.
Oh, I'll never tire of waving this 
thyrsus,
day and night, striking the ground. 
What rapture!
Now we can forget that we're old men.
TIRESIAS: [Following] You feel the same 
way I do, then.
For I'm young and going to try the 
dancing.
CADMUS: Shall we go up the mountain in 
a chariot?
TIRESIAS: The god would not then get 
complete respect.
CADMUS: So I'll be your nursemaid-one 
old man will take charge of another one?
TIRESIAS: The god himself will get us 
to the place without our efforts.
CADMUS: Of all the city are we the only 
ones who'll dance to honor Bacchus?
TIRESIAS: Yes, indeed, for we're the 
only ones whose minds are clear.
As for the others, well, their 
thinking's wrong.
CADMUS: I'm a mortal, so I don't mock 
the gods. [Dances to SL side of 
orchestra]

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

TIRESIAS: Will someone say I disrespect 
old age,
if I intend to dance with ivy on my 
head?
Not so, for the god makes no 
distinctions-
whether the dancing is for young or old.
He wants to gather honors from us all. 
[Dances to SR side of orchestra]
CADMUS: Since you're blind to daylight, 
Tiresias,
I'll be your seer, tell you what's 
going on- [Looks left]
Pentheus, the one to whom I handed over 
power in this land,
he's coming here. He's in a rush. He 
looks so flustered. [They stop dancing]
[Enter Pentheus, with an armed Soldier, 
from SR parados. Pentheus crosses up 
the ramp to the second
story of the skene; the Soldier lingers 
by the parados. At first Pentheus does 
not notice Cadmus and
Tiresias, not until he calls attention 
to them.]
PENTHEUS: It so happens I've been away 
from Thebes,
but I hear about disgusting things 
going on,
here in the city-women leaving home
to go to silly Bacchic rituals,
cavorting there in mountain shadows,
with dances honoring some upstart god,
this Dionysus, whoever he may be. 
Mixing bowls
in the middle of their meetings are 
filled with wine.
They creep off one by one to lonely 
spots
to have sex with men, claiming they're 
Maenads
busy worshipping.
All the ones I've caught, my servants 
guard
in our public prison, their hands 
chained up.
All those who're still away, I'll chase 
down,
hunt them from the mountains-that 
includes
Agave, who bore me.
Once I've clamped them all in iron 
fetters,
I'll quickly end this perverse 
nastiness,
this Bacchic celebration. People say
some stranger has arrived, some wizard,
a conjurer-with sweet-smelling hair in 
golden ringlets
and Aphrodite's charms in wine-dark 
eyes.
He hangs around the young girls day and 
night,
dangling in front of them his joyful 
mysteries.
If I catch him in this city, I'll stop 
him.
He'll make no more clatter with his 
thyrsus,
or wave his hair around. I'll chop off 
his head,
slice it right from his body. This man 
claims
that Dionysus is a god.
All this surely merits harsh punishment.
Whoever this stranger is, his insolence 
is an insult to me.
[Noticing Cadmus and Tiresias for the 
first time]
Well, here's something totally 
astounding!
I see Tiresias, our soothsayer, all 
dressed up
in dappled fawn skins-my mother's 
father, too!
This is ridiculous. To take a thyrsus

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

and jump around like this. [To Cadmus] 
You sir,
I don't like to see such arrant 
foolishness
from your old age. Why not throw out 
that ivy?
And, grandfather, why not let that 
thyrsus go?
Tiresias, you're the one who's put him 
up to this.
You want to bring in some new god for 
men,
and from his sacrifices make more money.
If your gray old age did not protect 
you,
you'd sit in chains with all the Bacchae
for such a ceremonial perversion.
Whenever women at some banquet
start to take pleasure in the gleaming 
wine,
I say there's nothing healthy in their 
worshipping.
TIRESIAS: You've got a quick tongue and 
seem intelligent,
but your words don't make any sense at 
all.
A fluent orator whose power comes
from self-assurance and from nothing 
else
makes a bad citizen, for he lacks sense.
This man, this new god, whom you 
ridicule-
it's impossible for me to tell you
just how great he'll be in all of 
Greece.
Trust me, Pentheus.
Don't be too confident a sovereign's 
force
controls men. If something seems right 
to you,
but your mind's diseased, don't think 
that's wisdom.
So welcome this god into your country.
Pour libations to him, then celebrate
these Bacchic rites with garlands on 
your head. [Begins to dance again.]
CADMUS: My child, Tiresias has given you
some good advice. You should live among 
us,
not outside traditions. At this point,
you're flying around-thinking, but not 
clearly.
Come here. Let me crown your head with 
ivy.
Join us in giving honor to this god. 
[Steps closer to the skene]
PENTHEUS: Keep your hands off me!
Go to these Bacchic rituals of yours.
But don't infect me with your madness.
As for the one who in this foolishness
has been your teacher, I'll bring him 
to justice.
[To his soldier]
You, go quickly to the city, scour it
to capture this effeminate stranger,
who corrupts our women with a new 
disease,
and thus infects our beds. If you get 
him,
tie him up and bring him here for 
judgment,
a death by stoning. That way he'll see
his rites in Thebes come to a bitter 
end.

[Exit Pentheus into the skene. The 
Soldier exits SR parados.]
TIRESIAS: [Stops dancing] You unhappy 
man, you've no idea
just what it is you're saying. You've 
gone mad!
Even before now you weren't in your 
right mind.
Let's be off, Cadmus. We'll pray to the 
god
on Pentheus' behalf, though he's a 
savage,
and for the city, too, so he won't harm 
it.
Come with me-bring the ivy-covered 
staff.
See if you can help support my body.
I'll do the same for you. It would be 
shameful
if two old men collapsed.
I'm not saying this as a prophecy,
but on the basis of what's going on.
A man who's mad tends to utter madness.
[Exit Tiresias and Cadmus together 
through the SL parados. Music, and the 
Chorus is heard on the
stream, as the Chorus Leader crosses 
the orchestra and dances.]
ODE 1
FIRST VOICE: Do you hear what Pentheus 
says?
Do you hear the profanities he utters,
the insults against Bromius, chief god
among all blessed gods?
This is his special office,
to lead men together in the dance,
to bring all sorrows to an end,
at the god's sacrificial feast.
SECOND VOICE: Unbridled tongues and 
lawless folly
come to an end only in disaster.
A peaceful life of wisdom
maintains tranquility.
But being clever isn't wisdom.
Our life is brief-that's why
the man who chases greatness
fails to grasp what's near at hand.
That's what madmen do,
men who've lost their wits.
That's what I believe.
THIRD VOICE: This god, son of Zeus,
rejoices in our banquets.
He adores the goddess Peace,
and she brings riches with her
and nourishes the young.
The god gives his wine equally,
sharing with rich and poor alike.
It takes away all sorrow.

EPISODE 2
[Enter the Soldier, through the SR 
parados, bringing Dionysus with his 
arms tied up, to slightly upstage
of the center of the orchestra. 
Pentheus enters from the ground level 
center door of the skene.]
SOLDIER: Pentheus, I’ve caught the prey
you sent me out to catch. He didn't try 
to run.
No, he surrendered willingly enough;
He even laughed at us,
inviting us to tie him up and lead him 
off.
And there's something else-
those Bacchic women you locked up, the 
ones
you took in chains into the public 
prison-
they've all escaped. They're 
gone-playing around
in some meadow, calling out to Bromius.
Chains fell off their feet,
just dropping on their own. Keys opened 
doors
not turned by human hands. This man here
has come to Thebes full of amazing 
tricks.
But now the rest of this affair is up 
to you.
[Pentheus crosses close to Dionysus, 
inspecting him carefully]
PENTHEUS: Untie his hands. I've got him 
in my nets.
He's not fast enough to get away from 
me.
[The soldier removes the chains from 
Dionysus' hands, and steps off to the 
SR side;. Pentheus moves in
closer]
Well, stranger, I see this body of yours
is not unsuitable for women's pleasure.
As for your hair, it's long, which 
suggests that you're no wrestler.
It flows across your cheeks. That's 
most seductive.
You've a white skin, too. You've looked 
after it,
avoiding the sun's rays by staying in 
the shade.
But first tell: Why do you bring these 
rituals to Greece?
DIONYSUS: Dionysus sent me-the son of 
Zeus.
PENTHEUS: Did this Zeus overpower you 
at night, in your dreams? Or were your 
eyes wide open?
DIONYSUS: I saw him-he saw me. He gave 
me the sacred rituals.
PENTHEUS: Tell me what they're like, 
those rituals of yours.
DIONYSUS: That information cannot be 
passed on to men like you, those 
uninitiated in the rites of
Bacchus.
PENTHEUS: Do they benefit those who 
sacrifice?
DIONYSUS: They're worth knowing, but 
you're not allowed to hear.
PENTHEUS: You've avoided that question 
skillfully, making me want to hear an 
answer.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

9

DIONYSUS: The rituals are no friend of 
any man who's hostile to the gods.
PENTHEUS: This god of yours, since you 
saw him clearly, what's he like?
DIONYSUS: He was what he wished to be, 
not made to order.
PENTHEUS: Again you fluently evade my 
question, saying nothing whatsoever.
DIONYSUS: Yes, but then a man can seem 
totally ignorant when speaking to a 
fool.
PENTHEUS: When you dance these rites, 
is it at night or during daylight?
DIONYSUS: Mainly at night. Shadows 
confer solemnity.
PENTHEUS: And deceive the women. It's 
all corrupt!
DIONYSUS: One can do shameful things in 
daylight, too.
PENTHEUS: You must be punished for 
these evil games.
DIONYSUS: You, too-for foolishness, 
impiety towards the god.
PENTHEUS: How brash this Bacchant is! 
How well prepared in using language!
DIONYSUS: What punishment am I to 
suffer? What harsh penalties will you 
inflict?
PENTHEUS: First, I'll cut off this 
delicate hair of yours.
DIONYSUS: My hair is sacred. I grow it 
for the god.
PENTHEUS: And give me that thyrsus in 
your hand.
DIONYSUS: This wand I carry is the 
god's, not mine. You'll have to seize 
it from me for yourself.
PENTHEUS: We'll lock your body up 
inside, in prison.
DIONYSUS: The god will personally set 
me free, whenever I so choose.
PENTHEUS: That only works if you call 
him while among the Bacchae.
DIONYSUS: He sees my suffering now-and 
from near by.
PENTHEUS: Where is he then? My eyes 
don't see him.
DIONYSUS: He's where I am. You can't 
see him, because you don't believe.
PENTHEUS: [To his Soldier] Seize him. 
He's insulting Thebes and me.
DIONYSUS: I warn you-you shouldn't tie 
me up. I've got my wits about me. 
You've lost yours.
PENTHEUS: But I'm more powerful than 
you, so I'll have you put in chains.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

10

DIONYSUS: You're quite ignorant of why 
you live, what you do, and who you are.
PENTHEUS: I am Pentheus, son of Agave 
and Echion.
DIONYSUS: A suitable name. It suggests 
misfortune.
PENTHEUS: [to his soldier] Go now. Lock 
him up.
That way he'll see nothing but the 
darkness.
There you can dance. As for all those 
women,
those partners in crime you brought 
along with you,
we'll sell them off or keep them here 
as slaves,
working our looms, once we've stopped 
their hands
beating those drum skins, making all 
that noise.
[Exit Pentheus into the skene, leaving 
Dionysus with the soldier]
DIONYSUS: I'll go, then. For I won't 
have to suffer
what won't occur. But you can be sure 
of this-
Dionysus, whom you claim does not exist,
will go after you for retribution
after all your insolence. He's the one
you put in chains when you treat me 
unjustly.
[The soldier crosses to Dionysus and 
leads him into the SR doorway of the 
skene. Music, and the Chorus
is heard on the stream, as the Chorus 
Leader crosses the orchestra and 
dances.]
ODE 2
FIRST VOICE: What rage, what rage
shows up in that earth-bound race
of Pentheus, born to Echion,
an earth-bound mortal.
He'll soon bind me in chains,
as a worshipper of Bacchus.
Already he holds in his house
my fellow Bacchic revelers,
hidden there in some dark cell.
SECOND VOICE: Do you see, Dionysus,
child of Zeus, your followers
fighting their oppression?
Come down, my lord,
down from Olympus,
wave your golden thyrsus,
to cut short the profanities
of this bloodthirsty man.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

11

THIRD VOICE: Perhaps in those thick 
woods
of Mount Olympus,
where Orpheus once played his lyre,
brought trees together with his songs,
collecting wild beasts round him-
Dionysus will come to set you dancing
in the Bacchic celebrations.
EPISODE 3
[The soldier return through the SR 
door; suddenly the ground begins to 
shake, thunder sounds, lightning
flashes, and the entire palace starts 
to break apart. The soldier falls to 
the ground cowering.]
DIONYSUS: [shouting from within the 
palace]
Io! Hear me, hear me as I call you. Io! 
Bacchae! Io Bacchae!
CHORUS LEADER:
Who's that? Who is it? It's Dionysus' 
voice! It's calling me. But from what 
direction?
DIONYSUS: [From inside the palace] Io! 
Io! I'm calling out again- the son of 
Semele, a child of Zeus!
CHORUS: Io! Io! Lord and master! Come 
join our company, Bromius, oh Bromius!
DIONYSUS: [From inside] Sacred lord of 
earthquakes, shake this ground.
[The earthquake tremors resume]
FIRST VOICE : Ai! Soon Pentheus' palace 
will be shaken into rubble.
SECOND VOICE : Dionysus is in the 
house-revere him.
THIRD VOICE : We revere him, we revere 
him.
FIRST VOICE : You see those stone 
lintels on the pillars-they're 
splitting up. It's Bromius calling,
shouting to us from inside the walls.
DIONYSUS: [from inside the palace] Let 
fiery lightning strike right now-burn 
Pentheus' palace-
consume it all!
[Fire appears and engulfs the palace.]
SECOND VOICE : Look! Don't you see the 
fire-Oh Maenads-throw your bodies on 
the ground, down,
down, for our master, Zeus' son, moves 
now against the palace-to demolish it.
[Dionysus appears, hovering before the 
skene, free of all chains, smiling and 
supremely confident.]
DIONYSUS: Ah, my Bacchants, it seems 
you feel Dionysus' power, as he rattles 
Pentheus' palace.
CHORUS LEADER: How happy I am to see 
you-Our greatest light in all the 
joyful dancing.
We felt alone and totally abandoned.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

12

DIONYSUS: [Flying about] Did you feel 
despair when I was sent away, cast down 
in Pentheus' gloomy
dungeon?
CHORUS LEADER: How could I not? Who'll 
protect me if you run into trouble? But 
tell me, how did
you escape that ungodly man?
DIONYSUS: No trouble. I saved myself 
with ease.
CHORUS LEADER: But didn't he bind your 
hands up in chains?
DIONYSUS: [Lands in the orchestra] In 
this business I was playing with him-
he thought he was tying me up, the fool!
He didn't even touch or handle me,
he was so busy feeding his desires.
In that stable where he went to tie me 
up,
he found a bull. He threw the iron 
fetters
around its knees and hooves. As he did 
so,
he kept panting in his rage, dripping 
sweat
from his whole body-his teeth gnawed 
his lip.
After a while, Bacchus came and shook 
the place.
Pentheus thought his palace was burning 
down.
He ran round, here and there,
yelling to his slaves to bring more 
water.
His servants set to work-and all for 
nothing!
So now I've strolled out calmly to you,
leaving the house, ignoring Pentheus.
No doubt he'll come out front here soon 
enough.
What will he say, I wonder, after this?
Well, I'll deal with him quite gently,
even if he comes out breathing up a 
storm.
After all, a wise man ought to keep his 
temper.
[Pentheus comes hurriedly out of the 
skene ground level center door]
PENTHEUS: What's happening to me-total 
disaster!
The stranger's escaped, and we'd just 
chained him up.
[Seeing Dionysus; the Chorus Leader 
hides behind Dionysus]
Ah ha! Here is the man-right here.
What's going on? How did you get out?
How come you're here, outside my palace?
DIONYSUS: Hold on. Calm down. Don't be 
so angry.
PENTHEUS: How did you escape your 
chains and get here?
DIONYSUS: Didn't I say someone would 
release me-or did you miss that part?
PENTHEUS: Who was it? You're always 
explaining things in riddles.
DIONYSUS: It was the one who cultivates 
for men the richly clustering vine.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

13

PENTHEUS: Ah, this Dionysus. Your words 
are a lovely insult to your god.
DIONYSUS: He came to Thebes with 
nothing but good things.
PENTHEUS: [To the Soldier, who rises] 
Seal off all the towers on my 
orders-all of them around the
city.
DIONYSUS: What for? Surely a god can 
make it over any wall?
PENTHEUS: You're so wise, except in all 
those things in which you should be 
wise.
DIONYSUS: I was born wise, especially 
in matters where I need to be.
[Enter the Messenger, a cattle herder 
from the hills, from the SL parados.]
DIONYSUS: But first you'd better listen 
to this man,
hear what he has to say, for he's come 
here
from the mountains to report to you.
I'll still be here for you. I won't run 
off. [Cheats SR, the Chorus Leader 
retreats DS]
MESSENGER: [Bowing, SL] Pentheus, ruler 
of this land of Thebes, I've just left 
Cithaeron, that
mountain where the sparkling snow never 
melts away.
PENTHEUS: What this important news 
you've come with?
MESSENGER: [Rises] I saw those women in 
their Bacchic revels,
those sacred screamers, all driven 
crazy,
the ones who run barefoot from their 
homes.
I came, my lord, to tell you and the 
city
the dreadful things they're doing. But, 
my lord,
first I wish to know if I should tell 
you,
openly report what's going on up there,
or whether I should hold my tongue.
Your mood changes so fast I get afraid-
your sharp spirit, your all-too-royal 
temper.
PENTHEUS: Speak on. Whatever you have 
to report,
you'll get no punishment at all from me.
The more terrible the things you tell me
about those Bacchic women, the worse
I'll move against the one who taught 
them
all their devious tricks.
MESSENGER: [steps closer] The grazing 
cattle
were just moving into upland pastures.
Right then I saw them-
three groups of dancing women. One of 
them
Autonoe led. Your mother, Agave,
led the second group, and Ino led the 
third.
They were all asleep, bodies quite 
relaxed,
resting on the ground-in all modesty.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

They weren't as you described-all drunk 
on wine
or on the music of their flutes.
Once she heard my horned cattle lowing,
your mother stood up amid those Bacchae,
then called them to stir their limbs 
from sleep.
They stood up straight there-a 
marvelous sight,
to see such an orderly arrangement,
women young and old and still unmarried 
girls.
First, they let their hair loose down 
their shoulders.
Then around their fawn skins
they looped some snakes, who licked the 
women's cheeks.
Some held young gazelles or wild wolf 
cubs
and fed them on their own white milk, 
the ones
who'd left behind at home a newborn 
child
whose breasts were still swollen full 
of milk.
Then one of them, taking a thyrsus, 
struck a rock with it,
and water gushed out, fresh as dew. 
Another,
using her thyrsus, scraped the ground. 
At once,
the god sent fountains of wine up from 
the spot.
All those who craved white milk to drink
just scratched the earth with their 
fingertips-
it came out in streams. From their ivy 
wands
thick sweet honey dripped. Oh, if you'd 
been there,
if you'd seen this, you'd come with 
reverence
to that god whom you criticize so much.
And then a man who'd been in town a bit
and had a way with words said to us all,
"You men who live in the holy regions
of these mountains, how'd you like to 
hunt down
Pentheus' mother, Agave-take her
away from these Bacchic celebrations,
do the king a favor?" To all of us
he seemed to make good sense. So we set 
up
an ambush, hiding in the bushes. At the 
appointed time,
the women started their Bacchic ritual.
The entire mountain and its wild animals
were, like them, in one Bacchic ecstasy.
Agave, by chance, was dancing close to 
me.
I jumped out, hoping to grab hold of 
her.
But she screamed out, "Oh, men are 
hunting us. Come on,
Armed with that thyrsus in your hand."
We ran off, and so escaped being torn 
apart.
But then those Bacchic women, all 
unarmed,
went at the heifers, using their bare 
hands.
You should have seen one ripping a fat, 
young calf apart-
others tearing cows in pieces with 
their hands.
You could've seen ribs and cloven hooves
tossed everywhere-some hung up in 
branches
dripping blood and gore.
And bulls, proud beasts till then,
dragged down by the hands of a thousand 
girls.

Hides covering their bodies were 
stripped off
faster than you could wink your royal 
eye.
Then they went back to where they'd 
started from,
those fountains which the god had made 
for them.
They washed off the blood. Snakes 
licked their cheeks,
cleansing their skin of every drop. My 
lord,
you must welcome this god into our city,
whoever he is. He's a mighty god in 
many other ways.
[Bows and exits SL parados. The Chorus 
Leader steps forward.]
CHORUS LEADER: I'm afraid to talk 
freely before the king,
but nonetheless I'll speak-this 
Dionysus is not inferior to any god.
PENTHEUS: This Dionysian arrogance, 
like fire,
keeps flaring up close by. We must not 
hesitate.
[To his soldier] Go to the Electra 
Gates. Call out the troops.
We'll march out against these Bacchae.
DIONYSUS: [Steps closer to Pentheus] 
You've heard what I had to say,
Pentheus, but still your not convinced.
I say you shouldn't go to war against a 
god.
You should stay calm. Bromius will not 
let you
move his Bacchae from their mountains.
PENTHEUS: Don't preach to me! You've 
got out of prison-
enjoy that fact. Or shall I punish you 
some more?
DIONYSUS: I'd sooner make an offering 
to that god than in some angry fit kick 
at his whip-a mortal
going to battle with a god.
PENTHEUS: [to the soldier, starting to 
cross to the skene]
It's useless trying to argue with this 
stranger- whatever he does or suffers, 
he won't shut up.
DIONYSUS [calling Pentheus back] My 
lord! There's still a chance to end 
this calmly.
PENTHEUS: [Stops] By doing what? Should 
I become a slave to my own slaves?
DIONYSUS: [moving up to Pentheus] How'd 
you like to gaze upon those women out 
there, sitting
together in the mountains?
PENTHEUS: I'd like that. Yes, for that 
I'd pay in gold-and pay a lot.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

16

DIONYSUS: Would you derive pleasure 
from looking on, viewing something you 
find painful?
PENTHEUS: Yes, I would-if I were 
sitting in the trees in silence.
DIONYSUS: But even if you go there 
secretly, they'll track you down.
PENTHEUS: You're right. I'll go there 
openly.
DIONYSUS: So you're prepared, are you, 
to make the trip? Shall I lead you 
there?
PENTHEUS: Let's go, and with all speed. 
I've got time.
DIONYSUS: In that case, you must clothe 
your body in a dress.
PENTHEUS: What! I'm not going up there 
as a man? I've got to change myself 
into a woman?
DIONYSUS: If they see you as a man, 
they'll kill you.
PENTHEUS: Right again. How can I best 
follow your suggestion?
DIONYSUS: I'll go inside your house and 
dress you up.
PENTHEUS: What? Dress up in a female 
outfit? I can't do that-I'd be ashamed 
to.
DIONYSUS: You're still keen to see the 
Maenads, aren't you?
PENTHEUS: What sort of clothing do you 
recommend? How should I cover up my 
body?
DIONYSUS: I'll fix up a long hairpiece 
for your head.
PENTHEUS: All right. What's the next 
piece of my outfit?
DIONYSUS: A dress down to your 
feet-then a thyrsus to hold and a 
dappled fawn skin.
PENTHEUS: No. I can't dress up in 
women's clothes!
DIONYSUS: But if you go fighting with 
these Bacchae, you'll cause bloodshed.
PENTHEUS: Yes, that's true. So first, 
we must go up and spy on them. But how 
will I make it through the
city without the Thebans noticing me?
DIONYSUS: We go by deserted streets. 
I'll take you.
PENTHEUS: Well, anything's easier to 
accept than being made a fool by 
Bacchic women. Let's go into
the house. I'll think about what's best.
DIONYSUS: As you wish. Whatever you do, 
I'm ready.
[Exit Pentheus into the skene. Dionysus 
turns to face the audience]

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

17

DIONYSUS: My women! that man's now 
entangled in our net.
He'll go to those Bacchae, and there 
he'll die.
That will be his punishment.
I want him made the laughing stock of 
Thebes,
while I lead him through the city, 
mincing
as he moves along in women's clothing,
after he made himself so terrifying
with all those earlier threats. Now 
I'll be off,
to fit Pentheus into the costume
he'll wear when he goes down to Hades,
once he's butchered by his mother's 
hands.
He'll come to acknowledge Dionysus,
son of Zeus, born in full divinity,
most fearful and yet most kind to men.
[Exit Dionysus into the skene central 
door. Music, and the Chorus is heard on 
the stream, as the Chorus
Leader crosses the orchestra and 
dances.]
ODE 3
FIRST VOICE: What is wisdom? What is 
finer
than the rights men get from gods-
to hold their powerful hands
over the heads of their enemies?
Ah yes, what's good is always loved.
SECOND VOICE: The power of the gods
is difficult to stir-
but it's a power we can count on.
It punishes all mortal men
who honor their own ruthless wills,
who, in their fits of madness,
fail to reverence the gods.
Gods track down every man
who scorns their worship,
using their cunning to conceal
the enduring steady pace of time.
THIRD VOICE: For there's no 
righteousness
in those who recognize or practice
what's beyond our customary laws.
The truth is easy to acknowledge:
whatever is divine is mighty,
whatever has been long-established law
is an eternal natural truth.

EPISODE 4
[Enter Dionysus from the skene. He 
calls back through the open doors]
DIONYSUS: You who are so desperately 
eager
to see those things you should not look 
upon,
so keen to chase what you should not 
pursue-
I mean you, Pentheus, come out here now,
dressed up as a raving Bacchic female,
to spy upon your mother's company.
[Enter Pentheus, from the skene, 
dressed in women's clothing. He moves 
in a deliberately over-stated
female way, enjoying the role and 
crosses to the center of the orchestra.]
DIONYSUS: [admiringly, as crosses to 
behind Pentheus] You look just like one 
of Cadmus' daughters.
PENTHEUS: Fancy that! I seem to see two 
suns, two images of seven-gated Thebes.
And you look like a bull leading me out 
here, with those horns growing from 
your head.
DIONYSUS: The god walks here. He's made 
a pact with us. Now you're seeing just 
what you ought to
see.
PENTHEUS: How do I look? Am I holding 
myself just like Ino or my mother, 
Agave?
DIONYSUS: When I look at you, I think I 
see them.
PENTHEUS: This thyrsus-should I hold it 
in my right hand, or in my left? Which 
is more suitable in
Bacchic celebrations?
DIONYSUS: In your right. You must lift 
your right foot in time with it. 
[Dionysus observes Pentheus
trying out the dance step] Your mind 
has changed. I applaud you for it.
PENTHEUS: Lead on-through the center of 
our land of Thebes. I'm the only man in 
all the city who
dares to undertake this enterprise.
DIONYSUS: You bear the city's burden by 
yourself, all by yourself. Follow me. 
I'm the guide who'll
rescue you. When you return someone 
else will bring you back.
PENTHEUS: That will be my mother.
DIONYSUS: You'll be carried back in 
your mother's arms.
PENTHEUS: Then I'll be off to get what 
I deserve.
[Exit Pentheus through the SL parados]
DIONYSUS: [speaking in the direction 
Pentheus has gone, but not speaking to 
him] You fearful,
terrifying man-on your way to horrific 
suffering. Hold out your hand to him, 
Agave,
you, too, her sisters, Cadmus' 
daughters. I'm leading this young man 
in your direction,
for the great confrontation, where I'll 
triumph.

[Dionysus vanishes, teleporting away. 
Music, and the Chorus is heard on the 
stream, as the Chorus
Leader crosses the orchestra and 
dances.]
ODE 4
FIRST VOICE: Up now, you hounds of 
madness,
go up now into the mountains,
go where Cadmus' daughters
keep their company of worshippers,
goad them into furious revenge
against that man, that raving spy,
all dressed up in his women's clothes,
so keen to glimpse the Maenads.
SECOND VOICE: His mother will see him 
first,
as he spies on them in secret.
She'll scream out to her Maenads,
"Who's the man who's come here,
to the mountains, to these mountains?
Oh my Bacchae, who has come?
From whom was this man born?
He's not born of woman's blood-
he must be some lioness' whelp."
THIRD VOICE: Let justice manifest 
itself-
let justice march, sword in hand,
to stab him in the throat,
that godless, lawless man,
unjust earthborn seed of Echion.
FIRST VOICE: Appear now to our sight, O 
Bacchus-
come as a bull or many-headed serpent
or else some fire-breathing lion.
Go now, Bacchus, with your smiling face
cast your deadly noose upon
that hunter of the Bacchae,
as the group of Maenads brings him down.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

EPISODE 5
[Enter the Soldier from SL parados.]
SOLDIER: How I grieve for this house, 
in earlier days so happy throughout 
Greece!
CHORUS LEADER
Do you bring news? Has something 
happened, something about the Bacchae?
SOLDIER: Pentheus, child of Echion, is 
dead.
CHORUS: Speak to me, tell all-How did 
death strike him down,
that unrighteous man, that man who 
acted so unjustly?
SOLDIER: We started the climb up Mount 
Cithaeron-
Pentheus and myself; the stranger was 
our guide.
First, we sat down in a grassy meadow,
keeping our feet and tongues quite 
silent,
so we could see without being noticed.
The Maenads sat there, their hands all 
busy with delightful work-
some of them with ivy strands repairing 
damaged thyrsoi,
while others sang, chanting Bacchic 
songs to one another.
Then Pentheus, that unhappy man,
not seeing the crowd of women, spoke up,
"Stranger, I can't see from where we're 
standing.
But up there, on that hill, a pine tree 
stands.
If I climbed that, I might see those 
women,
and witness the disgraceful things they 
do."
Then I saw that stranger work a marvel.
He seized that pine tree's topmost 
branch-
it stretched up to heaven-and brought 
it down,
pulling it to the dark earth, bending 
it as if it were a bow-
that's how the stranger made that tree 
bend down,
forcing the mountain pine to earth by 
hand,
something no mortal man could ever do.
He set Pentheus in that pine tree's 
branches.
Then his hands released the tree, but 
slowly,
so it stood up straight, being very 
careful
not to shake Pentheus loose. So that 
pine
towered straight up to heaven, with my 
king
perched on its back. Maenads could see 
him there
more easily than he could spy on them.
As he was just becoming visible-
the stranger had completely disappeared-
some voice-I guess it was Dionysus-
cried out from the sky, "Young women,
I've brought you the man who laughed at 
you,
who ridiculed my rites. Now punish him!"
The air was still. Then the women stood 
up at once.
They rushed out, running as fast as 
doves.
His mother Agave with both her sisters

20

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

and all the Bacchae charged straight 
through
the valley, pushed to a god-inspired 
frenzy.
They saw the king there sitting in that 
pine.
First, they started throwing rocks,
trying to hurt him. Others threw 
branches,
or hurled their thyrsoi through the air 
at
sad, miserable Pentheus, their target.
But they didn't hit him.
When these attempts all failed, Agave 
said,
"Come now, make a circle round the tree.
Then, Maenads, each of you must seize a 
branch,
so we can catch the climbing beast up 
there,
stop him making our god's secret dances 
known."
Thousands of hands grabbed the tree and 
pulled.
They yanked it from the ground. 
Pentheus fell,
screaming in distress. He knew well 
enough
something dreadful was about to happen.
His priestess mother first began the 
slaughter.
She hurled herself at him. Pentheus 
tore off
his headband, untying it from his head,
so wretched Agave would recognize him,
so she wouldn't kill him. Touching her 
cheek,
he cried out, "It's me, mother, 
Pentheus,
your child. Pity me, mother-
don't kill your child because I've made 
mistakes."
But Agave was foaming at the mouth,
eyes rolling in their sockets-she 
didn't listen-
she was possessed, in a Bacchic frenzy.
She seized his left arm, below the 
elbow,
pushed her foot against the poor man's 
ribs,
then tore his shoulder out. The 
strength she had-
it was not her own. The god put power
into those hands of hers. Meanwhile Ino,
her sister, went at the other side,
ripping off chunks of Pentheus' flesh,
while Autonoe and all the Bacchae,
the whole crowd of them, attacked as 
well,
all of them howling out together.
As long as Pentheus was still alive,
he kept on screaming. The women cried 
in triumph-
one brandished an arm, another held a 
foot-
complete with hunting boot-the women's 
nails
tore his ribs apart. Their hands grew 
bloody,
tossing bits of his flesh back and 
forth.
His body parts lie scattered everywhere-
some under rough rocks, some in the 
forest, deep in the trees.
As for the poor victim's head, his 
mother
stumbled on it. Her hands picked it up,
then stuck it on a thyrsus, at the tip.
Now she carries it around Cithaeron,
as though it were some wild lion's head.

21

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

22

She's coming here, inside these very 
walls,
showing off with pride her ill-fated 
prey,
calling out to her fellow hunter, 
Bacchus,
the glorious victor. By serving him,
in her great triumph she wins only 
tears.
As for me, I'm leaving this disaster,
before Agave gets back home again.
The best thing is to keep one's mind 
controlled,
and worship all that comes down from 
the gods.
That, in my view, is the wisest custom,
for those who can conduct their lives 
that way.
[Exit Soldier up the center aisle of 
the Theatron, sitting among the 
audience.]
ODE 5
CHORUS LEADER: [Steps to the center of 
the orchestra.] Let's dance to honor 
Bacchus!
[Music begins]
Wait!
[The music stops.]
I see Agave, Pentheus' mother,
on her way home, her eyes transfixed.
Let's now welcome her, the happy revels 
of our god of joy! [She steps down]
EPISODE 6
[Enter Agave, from SL parados, cradling 
the head of Pentheus. She walks around 
to the audience, talking
to them.]
AGAVE: Bacchae… [displaying the head]
From the mountains I've brought home 
this ivy tendril freshly cut.
We've had a blessed hunt.
I caught this young lion without a 
trap, as you can see.
The honor of the first blow goes to me.
In the dancing I'm called blessed Agave.
His other children laid hands on the 
beast,
but after me-only after I did first.
We've had good hunting. So come, share 
our feast.
[She stops center of the orchestra]
CHORUS LEADER: What? You want me to eat 
that with you? Oh you unhappy woman.
AGAVE: This is a young lion. Look at 
this cheek. It's just growing downy 
under the crop of his soft hair.

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

23

CHORUS LEADER: His hair makes him 
resemble some wild beast.
AGAVE: Bacchus is a clever huntsman-he 
wisely set his Maenads on this beast.
Soon all Cadmus' people will celebrate 
his mother, who caught the beast.
CHORUS LEADER: You're proud of what 
you've done?
AGAVE: Yes, I'm delighted. Great things 
I've done-great things on this hunt, 
clear for all to see.
CHORUS LEADER: Well then, you most 
unfortunate woman, show off your 
hunting prize, your sign of
victory, to all the citizens.
AGAVE: [addressing everyone] All of you 
here,
all you living in the land of Thebes, 
in this city with its splendid walls,
come see this wild beast we hunted down-
daughters of Cadmus-not with spears, or 
javelins, or by using nets;
we caught this beast by hand, tore it 
apart-with our own hands.
But where's my father? He should come 
here. [Steps right]
And where's Pentheus? Where is my son? 
He should take a ladder,
set it against the house, fix this 
lion's head way up there, high on the 
palace front.
I've captured it and brought it home 
with me.
[Enter Cadmus and Tiresias, from SL 
parados, carrying parts of Pentheus' 
body. They place the bits of
Pentheus' body together in a chest 
front of the skene, at the tip of the 
orchestra. Tiresias lingers up left.]
CADMUS:
I'm worn out. So many searches-but I 
picked up the body.
I came across it in the rocky clefts on 
Mount Cithaeron,
ripped to pieces, no parts lying 
together in one place.
It was in the woods-difficult to search.
Someone told me what my daughter'd 
done, those horrific acts,
Once I'd come back, returning here with 
old Tiresias,
inside the city walls, back from the 
Bacchae.
So I climbed the mountains once again.
Now I bring home this child the Maenads 
killed.
Someone said Agave was coming here,
still doing her Bacchic dance. He spoke 
the truth,
for I see her there-what a wretched 
sight!
AGAVE: Father, now you can be truly 
proud.
Among all living men you've produced
by far the finest daughters. I'm talking
of all of us, but especially of myself.
I've left behind my shuttle and my loom,
and risen to great things, catching 
wild beasts
with my bare hands. Now I've captured 
him,
I'm holding in my arms the finest 
trophy,
as you can see, bringing it back home 
to you,
so it may hang here.
[Offering him Pentheus' head] Take 
this, father
let your hands welcome it. Be proud of 
it,

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

24

of what I've caught. Summon all your 
friends-
have a banquet, for you are blessed 
indeed,
blessed your daughters have achieved 
these things.
CADMUS: [Turning away] This grief's 
beyond measure, beyond endurance.
With these hands of yours you've 
murdered him.
You strike down this sacrificial 
victim, then invite me,
and all of Thebes, to share a banquet.
Alas-first for your sorrow, then my own.
Lord god Bromius, has destroyed us, 
acting out his justice,
but too much so.
AGAVE: Why such scowling eyes?
How sorrowful and solemn old men become.
As for my son, I hope he's a fine 
hunter,
who copies his mother's hunting style.
The only thing he seems capable of doing
is fighting with the gods. It's up to 
you,
father, to reprimand him for it.
Who'll call him here into my sight,
so he can see my good luck for himself?
CADMUS: [Turns back to her] Alas! Alas! 
What dreadful pain you'll feel
when you recognize what you've just 
done.
If you stay forever in your present 
state,
you'll be unfortunate, but you won't 
feel
as if you're suffering unhappiness.
AGAVE: But what in all this is wrong or 
painful?
CADMUS: First, raise your eyes. Look up 
into the sky.
AGAVE: All right. But why tell me to 
look up there?
CADMUS: Does the sky still seem the 
same to you, or has it changed?
AGAVE: It seems, well, brighter…more 
translucent than it was before.
CADMUS: And your inner spirit-is it 
still shaking?
AGAVE: I don't understand what it is 
you're asking. But my mind is starting 
to clear somehow. It's
changing…it's not what it was before.
CADMUS: Can you hear me? Can you answer 
clearly?
AGAVE: Yes. But, father, what we 
discussed before, I've quite forgotten.
CADMUS: Then tell me this-to whose 
house did you come when you got married?
AGAVE: You gave me to Echion…

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

CADMUS: In that house you bore your 
husband a child. What was his name?
AGAVE: His name was Pentheus.
CADMUS: Well then, this head your hands 
are holding-whose is it?
AGAVE: It's a lion's.
CADMUS: Inspect it carefully. You can 
do that without much effort.
AGAVE: [inspecting the head] What is 
this? What am I looking at? What am I 
holding?
CADMUS: Look at it. You'll understand 
more clearly.
AGAVE: What I see fills me with 
horrific pain…such agony…
CADMUS: Does it still seem to you to be 
a lion's head?
AGAVE: No. It's appalling-this head I'm 
holding belongs to Pentheus.
CADMUS: Yes, that's right. I was 
lamenting his fate before you 
recognized him.
AGAVE: Who killed him? How did he come 
into my hands?
CADMUS: Harsh truth-how you come to 
light at the wrong moment.
AGAVE: Tell me. My heart is pounding in 
me to hear what you're about to say.
CADMUS: You killed him-you and your 
sisters.
AGAVE: Where was he killed? At home? In 
what sort of place?
CADMUS: He was killed where dogs once 
made a common meal of Actaeon.
AGAVE: Why did this poor man go to 
Cithaeron?
CADMUS: He went there to ridicule the 
god and you for celebrating Dionysus.
AGAVE: But how did we happen to be up 
there?
CADMUS: You were insane-the entire city 
was in a Bacchic madness.
AGAVE: Now I see. Dionysus has 
destroyed us all.
CADMUS: He took offense at being 
insulted. You did not consider him a 
god.
AGAVE: Father, where's the body of my 
dearest son?
CADMUS: I had trouble tracking the body 
down. I brought back what I found.

25

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

26

AGAVE: Are all his limbs laid out just 
as they should be? And Pentheus, what 
part did he play in my
madness?
CADMUS: Like you, he was irreverent to 
the god.
That's why the god linked you and him 
together
in the same disaster-thus destroying
the house and me, for I've no children 
left,
now I see this offspring of your womb,
you unhappy woman, cruelly butchered
in the most shameful way.
[Addressing the remains of Pentheus]
My child, you upheld the honor of our 
house,
my daughter's son. You were feared in 
Thebes.
No one who saw you ever would insult me,
though I was old, for you would then 
inflict
fit punishment. Now the mighty Cadmus,
the man who sowed and later harvested
the most splendid crop-the Theban 
people-
will be an exile, banished from his 
home,
a dishonored man.
If there's a man who disrespects the 
gods,
let him think about how this man 
perished-
then he should develop faith in them.
CHORUS LEADER: I'm sorry for you 
Cadmus-you're in pain.
But your grandson deserved his 
punishment.
AGAVE: Father, you see how all has 
changed for me.
From being your royal and honored 
daughter,
the mother of a king, I'm now 
transformed-
an abomination, something to fill
all people's hearts with horror, with 
disgust-
the mother who slaughtered her only son,
who tore him apart, ripping out the 
heart
from the child who filled her own heart 
with joy-
all to honor this god Dionysus.
But, father, give me your permission now
to lay out here the body of my son,
prepare his corpse for proper burial.
CADMUS: That's no easy task to 
undertake.
His body, all the parts I could collect,
lies here, in this chest, not a pretty 
sight.
My own eyes can hardly bear to see him.
But if you think you can endure the 
work,
then, my child, begin the appropriate 
rites.
AGAVE: [dragging the chest to the 
center of the orchestra]
Alas, for my poor son, my only child,
destroyed by his mother's Bacchic 
madness.
How could these hands of mine, which 
loved him so,

THE BACCHAE
v.2.1

have torn these limbs apart, ripped out 
his flesh.
Here's an arm which has held me all 
these years,
growing stronger as he grew into a man,
his feet…oh, how he used to run to me,
seeking assurance of his mother's love.
His face was handsome, on the verge of 
manhood.
See the soft down still resting on 
these lips,
which have kissed me thousands of times 
or more.
All this, and all the rest, set here 
before us.
Oh Zeus and all you Olympian gods….
[She cannot complete the ritual and 
collapses in grief]
It makes no sense-it's unendurable.
How could the god have wished such 
things on me?
CHORUS LEADER: [crossing to Agave and 
helping her rise]
Lady, you must bear what cannot be 
borne.
Your suffering is intense, but the god 
is just.
You insulted him in Thebes, showed no 
respect-
you've brought the punishment upon 
yourself.
FIRST VOICE: What is wisdom? What is 
finer
than the rights men get from gods-
to hold their powerful hands
over the heads of their enemies?
Ah yes, what's good is always loved.
So all praise Dionysus,
praise the dancing god,
god of our revelry,
god whose justice is divine,
whose justice now reveals itself.
[Enter Dionysus, deus ex machina, on 
the top of the skene, with the head of 
a bull]
DIONYSUS: Yes, I am Dionysus, son of 
Zeus.
You see me now before you as a god.
You Thebans learned about my powers too 
late.
Dishonoring me, you earn the penalty.
You refused my rites. Now you must 
leave-
abandon your city for barbarian lands.
Agave, too, that polluted creature,
must go into perpetual banishment.
And Cadmus, you too must endure your 
lot.
That's what I proclaim-I, Dionysus,
born from no mortal father, but from 
Zeus.
If you had understood how to behave
as you should have when you were 
unwilling,
you'd now be fortunate, with Zeus' child
among your allies.
CADMUS: O Dionysus, we implore 
you-we've not acted justly.

DIONYSUS: You learn too late. You were 
ignorant when you should have known.
CADMUS: Now we understand. Your actions 
against us are too severe.
DIONYSUS: I was born a god, and you 
insulted me.
CADMUS: Angry gods should not act just 
like humans.
DIONYSUS: My father Zeus willed all 
this long ago.
AGAVE: Alas, old man, then this must be 
our fate, a miserable exile.
DIONYSUS: Why then delay? Why postpone 
what necessity requires?
CADMUS: Child, we've stumbled into this 
disaster,
this terrible calamity-you and me, both 
in agony-your sisters, too.
So I'll go out to the barbarians, a 
foreign resident in my old age.
But even then, there'll be no end to my 
wretched sorrows.
I'll never sail the downward plunging 
Acheron and reach some final peace.
AGAVE: [embracing Cadmus] Father, I 
must be exiled without you.
CADMUS: Why do you throw your arms 
about me, my unhappy child, just like 
some young swan
protecting an old one-gray and helpless.
AGAVE: Because I've no idea where to 
go, once I'm banished from my father's 
land.
CADMUS: Child, I don't know. Your 
father's not much help.
AGAVE: Farewell, then, to my home. 
Farewell to my native city.
In my misfortune I abandon you, an 
exile from spaces once my own.
[Turning to Cadmus] How I grieve for 
you, my father.
CADMUS: And I grieve for you, my child, 
as I weep for your sisters.
AGAVE: Lord Dionysus has inflicted such 
brutal terror on your house.
DIONYSUS: Yes. For at your hands I 
suffered, too-and dreadfully.
For here in Thebes my name received no 
recognition.
AGAVE: Farewell, father.
CADMUS: My most unhappy daughter, may 
you fare well. That will be hard for 
you.
AGAVE: Lead on, friends, so I may take 
my sisters, those pitiful women, into 
exile with me.
May I go somewhere where cursed 
Cithaeron will never see me, nor my 
eyes glimpse
that dreadful mountain, a place far 
away from any sacred thyrsus. Let others
make Bacchic celebrations their concern.
[Exit Agave up the aisle to the top of 
the Theatron; she stands there frozen. 
Music.]

EXODOS
CHORUS LEADER: The gods appear in many 
forms,
carrying with them unwelcome things.
What people thought would happen never 
did.
What they did not expect, the gods made 
happen.
That's what this story has revealed.
[Cadmus exits SR parados; Tiresias 
enters the skene by the SL door; the 
Chorus Leader vanishes, then
Dionysus vanishes. Only the chest with 
the remains Pentheus' body is on stage. 
A swirl of sparkles flies
around it.]
