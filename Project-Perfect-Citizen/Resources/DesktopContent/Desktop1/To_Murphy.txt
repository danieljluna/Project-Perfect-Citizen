    Dear Murphy,

I found your hidden photos.  I cannot begin 
to describe the pain this causes me.  Disgust
and empathy is a strange combination.  

I know you're trying, but this is proof 
you're not trying hard enough.  If you were
not strong enough to delete these on your 
own, maybe  you're strong enough not to seek
them out again.

I want to help you.  I want to be here for
you.  I will not allow myself to enable you.

I will only do this once.

        Love Lisa
