Invisible Man
by Ralph Ellison
a.b.e-book v3.0 / Notes at EOF

Back Cover:
Winner of the National Book Award for 
fiction. . . Acclaimed by a 1965 Book
Week poll of 200 prominent authors, 
critics, and editors as "the most
distinguished single work published in 
the last twenty years."
Unlike any novel you've ever read, this 
is a richly comic, deeply
tragic, and profoundly soul-searching 
story of one young Negro's baffling
experiences on the road to 
self-discovery.
From the bizarre encounter with the 
white trustee that results in his
expulsion from a Southern college, to 
its powerful culmination in New York's
Harlem, his story moves with a 
relentless drive: -- the nightmarish 
job in a
paint factory -- the bitter 
disillusionment with the "Brotherhood" 
and its
policy of betrayal -- the violent 
climax when screaming tensions are 
released
in a terrifying race riot.
This brilliant, monumental novel is a 
triumph of story-telling. It
reveals profound insight into every 
man's struggle to find his true self.
"Tough, brutal, sensational. . . it 
blazes with authentic talent." -- New 
York
Times
"A work of extraordinary intensity -- 
powerfully imagined and written with a
savage, wryly humorous gusto." -- The 
Atlantic Monthly
"A stunning block-buster of a book that 
will floor and flabbergast some
people, bedevil and intrigue others, 
and keep everybody reading right through
to its explosive end." -- Langston 
Hughes
"Ellison writes at a white heat, but a 
heat which he manipulates like a
veteran." -- Chicago Sun-Times

"You are saved," cried Captain Delano, 
more and more astonished and pained;
"you are saved: what has cast such a 
shadow upon you?"
Herman Melville, Benito Cereno
HARRY: I tell you, it is not me you are 
looking at,

Not me you are grinning at, not me your
confidential looks
Incriminate, but that other person, if 
person,
You thought I was: let your necrophily
Feed upon that carcase. . .
T. S. Eliot, Family Reunion

Prologue
I am an invisible man. No, I am not a 
spook like those who haunted
Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your 
Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a
man of substance, of flesh and bone, 
fiber and liquids -- and I might even be
said to possess a mind. I am invisible, 
understand, simply because people
refuse to see me. Like the bodiless 
heads you see sometimes in circus
sideshows, it is as though I have been 
surrounded by mirrors of hard,
distorting glass. When they approach me 
they see only my surroundings,
themselves, or figments of their 
imagination -- indeed, everything and
anything except me.
Nor is my invisibility exactly a matter 
of a bio-chemical accident to
my epidermis. That invisibility to 
which I refer occurs because of a 
peculiar
disposition of the eyes of those with 
whom I come in contact. A matter of
the construction of their inner eyes, 
those eyes with which they look through
their physical eyes upon reality. I am 
not complaining, nor am I protesting
either. It is sometimes advantageous to 
be unseen, although it is most often
rather wearing on the nerves. Then too, 
you're constantly being bumped
against by those of poor vision. Or 
again, you often doubt if you really 
exist.
You wonder whether you aren't simply a 
phantom in other people's minds.
Say, a figure in a nightmare which the 
sleeper tries with all his strength to
destroy. It's when you feel like this 
that, out of resentment, you begin to
bump people back. And, let me confess, 
you feel that way most of the time.
You ache with the need to convince 
yourself that you do exist in the real
world, that you're a part of all the 
sound and anguish, and you strike out
with your fists, you curse and you
swear to make them recognize you. And,
alas, it's seldom successful.
One night I accidentally bumped into a 
man, and perhaps because of
the near darkness he saw me and called 
me an insulting name. I sprang at
him, seized his coat lapels and 
demanded that he apologize. He was a 
tall
blond man, and as my face came close to 
his he looked insolently out of his
blue eyes and cursed me, his breath hot 
in my face as he struggled. I pulled
his chin down sharp upon the crown of 
my head, butting him as I had seen
the West Indians do, and I felt his 
flesh tear and the blood gush out, and I
yelled, "Apologize! Apologize!" But he 
continued to curse and struggle, and I
butted him again and again until he 
went down heavily, on his knees,
profusely bleeding. I kicked him 
repeatedly, in a frenzy because he still
uttered insults though his lips were 
frothy with blood. Oh yes, I kicked him!
And in my outrage I got out my knife 
and prepared to slit his throat, right
there beneath the lamplight in the 
deserted street, holding him by the 
collar
with one hand, and opening the knife 
with my teeth -- when it occurred to
me that the man had not seen me, 
actually; that he, as far as he knew, 
was
in the midst of a walking nightmare! 
And I stopped the blade, slicing the air
as I pushed him away, letting him fall 
back to the street. I stared at him
hard as the lights of a car stabbed 
through the darkness. He lay there,
moaning on the asphalt; a man almost 
killed by a phantom. It unnerved me.
I was both disgusted and ashamed. I was 
like a drunken man myself,
wavering about on weakened legs. Then I 
was amused. Something in this
man's thick head had sprung out and 
beaten him within an inch of his life. I
began to laugh at this crazy discovery. 
Would he have awakened at the point
of death? Would Death himself have 
freed him for wakeful living? But I
didn't linger. I ran away into the 
dark, laughing so hard I feared I might
rupture myself. The next day I saw his 
picture in the Daily News, beneath a
caption stating that he had been 
"mugged." Poor fool, poor blind fool, I
thought with sincere compassion, mugged 
by an invisible man!
Most of the time (although I do not 
choose as I once did to deny
the violence of my days by ignoring it) 
I am not so overtly violent. I
remember that I am invisible and walk 
softly so as not to awaken the
sleeping ones. Sometimes it is best not 
to awaken them; there are few things
in the world as dangerous as 
sleepwalkers. I learned in time though 
that it is
possible to carry on a fight against
them without their realizing it. For
instance, I have been carrying on a 
fight with Monopolated Light & Power for
some time now. I use their service and 
pay them nothing at all, and they
don't know it. Oh, they suspect that 
power is being drained off, but they
don't know where. All they know is that 
according to the master meter back
there in their power station a hell of 
a lot of free current is disappearing
somewhere into the jungle of Harlem. 
The joke, of course, is that I don't 
live
in Harlem but in a border area. Several 
years ago (before I discovered the
advantage of being invisible) I went 
through the routine process of buying
service and paying their outrageous 
rates. But no more. I gave up all that,
along with my apartment, and my old way 
of life: That way based upon the
fallacious assumption that I, like 
other men, was visible. Now, aware of my
invisibility, I live rent-free in a 
building rented strictly to whites, in 
a section
of the basement that was shut off and 
forgotten during the nineteenth
century, which I discovered when I was 
trying to escape in the night from
Ras the Destroyer. But that's getting 
too far ahead of the story, almost to 
the
end, although the end is in the 
beginning and lies far ahead.
The point now is that I found a home -- 
or a hole in the ground, as
you will. Now don't jump to the 
conclusion that because I call my home a
"hole" it is damp and cold like a 
grave; there are cold holes and warm 
holes.
Mine is a warm hole. And remember, a 
bear retires to his hole for the winter
and lives until spring; then he comes 
strolling out like the Easter chick
breaking from its shell. I say all this 
to assure you that it is incorrect to
assume that, because I'm invisible and 
live in a hole, I am dead. I am
neither dead nor in a state of 
suspended animation. Call me 
Jack-the-Bear,
for I am in a state of hibernation.
My hole is warm and full of light. Yes, 
full of light. I doubt if there
is a brighter spot in all New York than 
this hole of mine, and I do not
exclude Broadway. Or the Empire State 
Building on a photographer's dream
night. But that is taking advantage of 
you. Those two spots are among the
darkest of our whole civilization -- 
pardon me, our whole culture (an
important distinction, I've heard) -- 
which might sound like a hoax, or a
contradiction, but that (by 
contradiction, I mean) is how the world 
moves:
Not like an arrow, but a boomerang. 
(Beware of those who speak of the
spiral of history; they are preparing a 
boomerang. Keep a steel helmet handy.)
I know; I have been boomeranged across
my head so much that I now can
see the darkness of lightness. And I 
love light. Perhaps you'll think it 
strange
that an invisible man should need 
light, desire light, love light. But 
maybe it
is exactly because I am invisible. 
Light confirms my reality, gives birth 
to my
form. A beautiful girl once told me of 
a recurring nightmare in which she lay
in the center of a large dark room and 
felt her face expand until it filled the
whole room, becoming a formless mass 
while her eyes ran in bilious jelly up
the chimney. And so it is with me. 
Without light I am not only invisible, 
but
formless as well; and to be unaware of 
one's form is to live a death. I
myself, after existing some twenty 
years, did not become alive until I
discovered my invisibility.
That is why I fight my battle with 
Monopolated Light & Power. The
deeper reason, I mean: It allows me to 
feel my vital aliveness. I also fight
them for taking so much of my money 
before I learned to protect myself. In
my hole in the basement there are 
exactly 1,369 lights. I've wired the 
entire
ceiling, every inch of it. And not with 
fluorescent bulbs, but with the older,
more-expensive-to-operate kind, the 
filament type. An act of sabotage, you
know. I've already begun to wire the 
wall. A junk man I know, a man of
vision, has supplied me with wire and 
sockets. Nothing, storm or flood, must
get in the way of our need for light 
and ever more and brighter light. The
truth is the light and light is the 
truth. When I finish all four walls, 
then I'll
start on the floor. Just how that will 
go, I don't know. Yet when you have
lived invisible as long as I have you 
develop a certain ingenuity. I'll solve 
the
problem. And maybe I'll invent a gadget 
to place my coffeepot on the fire
while I lie in bed, and even invent a 
gadget to warm my bed -- like the
fellow I saw in one of the picture 
magazines who made himself a gadget to
warm his shoes! Though invisible, I am 
in the great American tradition of
tinkers. That makes me kin to Ford, 
Edison and Franklin. Call me, since I
have a theory and a concept, a 
"thinker-tinker." Yes, I'll warm my 
shoes; they
need it, they're usually full of holes. 
I'll do that and more.
Now I have one radio-phonograph; I plan 
to have five. There is a
certain acoustical deadness in my hole, 
and when I have music I want to feel
its vibration, not only with my ear but 
with my whole body. I'd like to hear
five recordings of Louis Armstrong 
playing and singing "What Did I Do to Be
so Black and Blue" -- all at the same 
time. Sometimes now I listen to Louis
while I have my favorite dessert of
vanilla ice cream and sloe gin. I pour 
the red liquid over the white mound,
watching it glisten and the vapor 
rising as
Louis bends that military instrument 
into a beam of lyrical sound. Perhaps I
like Louis Armstrong because he's made 
poetry out of being invisible. I think
it must be because he's unaware that he 
is invisible. And my own grasp of
invisibility aids me to understand his 
music. Once when I asked for a
cigarette, some jokers gave me a 
reefer, which I lighted when I got home 
and sat listening to my phonograph. It was
a strange evening. Invisibility, let me
explain, gives one a slightly different 
sense of time, you're never quite on the
beat. Sometimes you're ahead and 
sometimes behind. Instead of the swift 
and imperceptible flowing of time, you are
aware of its nodes, those points where
time stands still or from which it 
leaps ahead. And you slip into the 
breaks
and look around. That's what you hear 
vaguely in Louis' music.
Once I saw a prizefighter boxing a 
yokel. The fighter was swift and
amazingly scientific. His body was one 
violent flow of rapid rhythmic action.
He hit the yokel a hundred times while 
the yokel held up his arms in
stunned surprise. But suddenly the 
yokel, rolling about in the gale of 
boxing
gloves, struck one blow and knocked 
science, speed and footwork as cold as a
well-digger's posterior. The smart 
money hit the canvas. The long shot got 
the nod. The yokel had simply stepped
inside of his opponent's sense of time. 
So under the spell of the reefer I
discovered a new analytical way of 
listening to
music. The unheard sounds came through, 
and each melodic line existed of
itself, stood out clearly from all the 
rest, said its piece, and waited 
patiently
for the other voices to speak. That 
night I found myself hearing not only in
time, but in space as well. I not only 
entered the music but descended, like
Dante, into its depths. And beneath the 
swiftness of the hot tempo there was
a slower tempo and a cave and I entered 
it and looked around and heard an
old woman singing a spiritual as full 
of Weltschmerz as flamenco, and
beneath that lay a still lower level on 
which I saw a beautiful girl the color
of ivory pleading in a voice like my 
mother's as she stood before a group of
slave owners who bid for her naked 
body, and below that I found a lower
level and a more rapid tempo and I 
heard someone shout:
"Brothers and sisters, my text this 
morning is the 'Blackness of
Blackness.' "
And a congregation of voices answered: 
"That blackness is most
black, brother, most black . . ."
"In the beginning . . ."
"At the very start," they cried.
". . . there was blackness . . ."
"Preach it . . ."
". . . and the sun . . ."
"The sun, Lawd . . ."
". . . was bloody red . . ."
"Red . . ."
"Now black is . . ." the preacher 
shouted.
"Bloody . . ."
"I said black is . . ."
"Preach it, brother . . ."
". . . an' black ain't . . "
"Red, Lawd, red: He said it's red!"
"Amen, brother . . ."
"Black will git you . . ."
"Yes, it will . . ."
". . . an' black won't . . ."
"Naw, it won't!"
"It do . . ."
"It do, Lawd . . ."
". . . an' it don't."
"Halleluiah . . ."
". . . It'll put you, glory, glory, Oh 
my Lawd, in the WHALE'S
BELLY."
"Preach it, dear brother . . ."
". . . an' make you tempt . . ."
"Good God a-mighty!"
"Old Aunt Nelly!"
"Black will make you . . ."
"Black . . ."
". . . or black will un-make you."
"Ain't it the truth, Lawd?"
And at that point a voice of trombone 
timbre screamed at me, "Git
out of, here, you fool! Is you ready to
commit treason?"
And I tore myself away, hearing the old 
singer of spirituals moaning,
"Go curse your God, boy, and die."
I stopped and questioned her, asked her 
what was wrong.
"I dearly loved my master, son," she 
said.
"You should have hated him," I said.
"He gave me several sons," she said, 
"and because I loved my sons I
learned to love their father though I 
hated him too."
"I too have become acquainted with 
ambivalence," I said. "That's why
I'm here."
"What's that?"
"Nothing, a word that doesn't explain 
it. Why do you moan?"
"I moan this way 'cause he's dead," she 
said.
"Then tell me, who is that laughing 
upstairs?"
"Them's my sons. They glad."
"Yes, I can understand that too," I 
said.
"I laughs too, but I moans too. He 
promised to set us free but he
never could bring hisself to do it. 
Still I loved him . . ."
"Loved him? You mean . . ."
"Oh yes, but 1 loved something else 
even more."
"What more?"
"Freedom."
"Freedom," I said. "Maybe freedom lies 
in hating."
"Naw, son, it's in loving. I loved him 
and give him the poison and
he withered away like a frost-bit 
apple. Them boys woulda tore him to 
pieces
with they homemake knives."
"A mistake was made somewhere," I said, 
"I'm confused." And I
wished to say other things, but the 
laughter upstairs became too loud and
moan-like for me and I tried to break 
out of it, but I couldn't. Just as I was
leaving I felt an urgent desire to ask 
her what freedom was and went back.
She sat with her head in her hands, 
moaning softly; her leather-brown face
was filled with sadness.
"Old woman, what is this freedom you 
love so well?" I asked around
a corner of my mind.
She looked surprised, then thoughtful, 
then baffled. "I done forgot,
son. It's all mixed up. First I think
it's one thing, then I think it's 
another. It
gits my head to spinning. I guess now 
it ain't nothing but knowing how to
say what I got up in my head. But it's 
a hard job, son. Too much is done
happen to me in too short a time. Hit's 
like I have a fever. Ever' time I
starts to walk my head gits to swirling 
and I falls down. Or if it ain't that,
it's the boys; they gits to laughing 
and wants to kill up the white folks.
They's bitter, that's what they is . . ."
"But what about freedom?"
"Leave me 'lone, boy; my head aches!"
I left her, feeling dizzy myself. I 
didn't get far.
Suddenly one of the sons, a big fellow 
six feet tall, appeared out of
nowhere and struck me with his fist.
"What's the matter, man?" I cried.
"You made Ma cry!"
"But how?" I said, dodging a blow.
"Askin' her them questions, that's how. 
Git outa here and stay, and
next time you got questions like that, 
ask yourself!"
He held me in a grip like cold stone, 
his fingers fastening upon my
windpipe until I thought I would 
suffocate before he finally allowed me 
to go.
I stumbled about dazed, the music 
beating hysterically in my ears. It was
dark. My head cleared and I wandered 
down a dark narrow passage, thinking
I heard his footsteps hurrying behind 
me. I was sore, and into my being had
come a profound craving for 
tranquillity, for peace and quiet, a 
state I felt I
could never achieve. For one thing, the 
trumpet was blaring and the rhythm
was too hectic. A tomtom beating like 
heart-thuds began drowning out the
trumpet, filling my ears. I longed for 
water and I heard it rushing through
the cold mains my fingers touched as I 
felt my way, but I couldn't stop to
search because of the footsteps behind 
me.
"Hey, Ras," I called. "Is it you, 
Destroyer? Rinehart?"
No answer, only the rhythmic footsteps 
behind me. Once I tried
crossing the road, but a speeding 
machine struck me, scraping the skin 
from
my leg as it roared past.
Then somehow I came out of it, 
ascending hastily from this
underworld of sound to hear Louis 
Armstrong innocently asking,
What did I do
To be so black
And blue?
At first I was afraid; this familiar 
music had demanded action, the
kind of which I was incapable, and yet 
had I lingered there beneath the
surface I might have attempted to act. 
Nevertheless, I know now that few
really listen to this music. I sat on 
the chair's edge in a soaking sweat, as
though each of my 1,369 bulbs had 
everyone become a klieg light in an
individual setting for a third degree 
with Ras and Rinehart in charge. It was
exhausting -- as though I had held my 
breath continuously for an hour under
the terrifying serenity that comes from 
days of intense hunger. And yet, it
was a strangely satisfying experience 
for an invisible man to hear the silence
of sound. I had discovered unrecognized 
compulsions of my being -- even
though I could not answer "yes" to 
their promptings. I haven't smoked a
reefer since, however; not because 
they're illegal, but because to see 
around
corners is enough (that is not unusual 
when you are invisible). But to hear
around them is too much; it inhibits 
action. And despite Brother Jack and all
that sad, lost period of the 
Brotherhood, I believe in nothing if 
not in action.
Please, a definition: A hibernation is 
a covert preparation for a more
overt action.
Besides, the drug destroys one's sense 
of time completely. If that
happened, I might forget to dodge some 
bright morning and some cluck
would run me down with an orange and 
yellow street car, or a bilious bus!
Or I might forget to leave my hole when 
the moment for action presents
itself.
Meanwhile I enjoy my life with the 
compliments of Monopolated
Light & Power. Since you never 
recognize me even when in closest 
contact
with me, and since, no doubt, you'll 
hardly believe that I exist, it won't
matter if you know that I tapped a 
power line leading into the building and
ran it into my hole in the ground. 
Before that I lived in the darkness into
which I was chased, but now I see. I've 
illuminated the blackness of my
invisibility -- and vice versa. And so 
I play the invisible music of my
isolation. The last statement doesn't 
seem just right, does it? But it is; you
hear this music simply because music is 
heard and seldom seen, except by
musicians. Could this compulsion to put
invisibility down in black and white
be thus an urge to make music of 
invisibility? But I am an orator, a 
rabble
rouser -- Am? I was, and perhaps shall 
be again. Who knows? All sickness is
not unto death, neither is invisibility.
I can hear you say, "What a horrible, 
irresponsible bastard!" And
you're right. I leap to agree with you. 
I am one of the most irresponsible
beings that ever lived. 
Irresponsibility is part of my 
invisibility; any way you
face it, it is a denial. But to whom 
can I be responsible, and why should I
be, when you refuse to see me? And wait 
until I reveal how truly
irresponsible I am. Responsibility 
rests upon recognition, and recognition 
is a
form of agreement. Take the man whom I 
almost killed: Who was responsible
for that near murder -- I? I don't 
think so, and I refuse it. I won't buy 
it.
You can't give it to me. He bumped me, 
he insulted me. Shouldn't he, for his
own personal safety, have recognized my 
hysteria, my "danger potential"? He,
let us say, was lost in a dream world. 
But didn't he control that dream world
-- which, alas, is only too real! -- 
and didn't he rule me out of it? And if 
he had yelled for a policeman, wouldn't I
have been taken for the offending one?
Yes, yes, yes! Let me agree with you, I 
was the irresponsible one; for I
should have used my knife to protect 
the higher interests of society. Some
day that kind of foolishness will cause 
us tragic trouble. All dreamers and
sleepwalkers must pay the price, and 
even the invisible victim is responsible
for the fate of all. But I shirked that 
responsibility; I became too snarled in
the incompatible notions that buzzed 
within my brain. I was a coward . . .
But what did I do to be so blue? Bear 
with me.

Chapter 1
It goes a long way back, some twenty 
years. All my life I had been
looking for something, and everywhere I 
turned someone tried to tell me
what it was. I accepted their answers 
too, though they were often in
contradiction and even 
self-contradictory. I was na?e. I was 
looking for myself
and asking everyone except myself
questions which I, and only I, could
answer. It took me a long time and much 
painful boomeranging of my
expectations to achieve a realization 
everyone else appears to have been born
with: That I am nobody but myself. But 
first I had to discover that I am an
invisible man!
And yet I am no freak of nature, nor of 
history. I was in the cards,
other things having been equal (or 
unequal) eighty-five years ago. I am not
ashamed of my grandparents for having 
been slaves. I am only ashamed of
myself for having at one time been 
ashamed. About eighty-five years ago 
they were told that they were free, united
with others of our country in everything
pertaining to the common good, and, in 
everything social, separate like the
fingers of the hand. And they believed 
it. They exulted in it. They stayed in
their place, worked hard, and brought 
up my father to do the same. But my
grandfather is the one. He was an odd 
old guy, my grandfather, and I am
told I take after him. It was he who 
caused the trouble. On his deathbed he
called my father to him and said, "Son, 
after I'm gone I want you to keep up
the good fight. I never told you, but 
our life is a war and I have been a
traitor all my born days, a spy in the 
enemy's country ever since I give up
my gun back in the Reconstruction. Live 
with your head in the lion's mouth.
I want you to overcome 'em with yeses, 
undermine 'em with grins, agree 'em
to death and destruction, let 'em 
swoller you till they vomit or bust wide
open." They thought the old man had 
gone out of his mind. He had been the
meekest of men. The younger children 
were rushed from the room, the
shades drawn and the flame of the lamp 
turned so low that it sputtered on
the wick like the old man's breathing. 
"Learn it to the younguns," he
whispered fiercely; then he died.
But my folks were more alarmed over his 
last words than over his
dying. It was as though he had not died 
at all, his words caused so much
anxiety. I was warned emphatically to 
forget what he had said and, indeed,
this is the first time it has been 
mentioned outside the family circle. It 
had a
tremendous effect upon me, however. I 
could never be sure of what he
meant. Grandfather had been a quiet old 
man who never made any trouble,
yet on his deathbed he had called 
himself a traitor and a spy, and he had
spoken of his meekness as a dangerous 
activity. It became a constant puzzle
which lay unanswered in the back of my 
mind. And whenever things went
well for me I remembered my grandfather
and felt guilty and uncomfortable.
It was as though I was carrying out his 
advice in spite of myself. And to
make it worse, everyone loved me for 
it. I was praised by the most lily-white
men of the town. I was considered an 
example of desirable conduct -- just as
my grandfather had been. And what 
puzzled me was that the old man had
defined it as treachery. When I was 
praised for my conduct I felt a guilt 
that
in some way I was doing something that 
was really against the wishes of the
white folks, that if they had 
understood they would have desired me 
to act
just the opposite, that I should have 
been sulky and mean, and that that
really would have been what they 
wanted, even though they were fooled and
thought they wanted me to act as I did. 
It made me afraid that some day
they would look upon me as a traitor 
and I would be lost. Still I was more
afraid to act any other way because 
they didn't like that at all. The old 
man's
words were like a curse. On my 
graduation day I delivered an oration in
which I showed that humility was the 
secret, indeed, the very essence of
progress. (Not that I believed this -- 
how could I, remembering my
grandfather? -- I only believed that it 
worked.) It was a great success.
Everyone praised me and I was invited 
to give the speech at a gathering of
the town's leading white citizens. It 
was a triumph for our whole community.
It was in the main ballroom of the 
leading hotel. When I got there I
discovered that it was on the occasion 
of a smoker, and I was told that since
I was to be there anyway I might as 
well take part in the battle royal to be
fought by some of my schoolmates as 
part of the entertainment. The battle
royal came first.
All of the town's big shots were there 
in their tuxedoes, wolfing down
the buffet foods, drinking beer and 
whiskey and smoking black cigars. It was
a large room with a high ceiling. 
Chairs were arranged in neat rows around
three sides of a portable boxing ring. 
The fourth side was clear, revealing a
gleaming space of polished floor. I had 
some misgivings over the battle royal,
by the way. Not from a distaste for 
fighting, but because I didn't care too
much for the other fellows who were to 
take part. They were tough guys who
seemed to have no grandfather's curse 
worrying their minds. No one could
mistake their toughness. And besides, I 
suspected that fighting a battle royal
might detract from the dignity of my 
speech. In those pre-invisible days I
visualized myself as a potential Booker 
T. Washington. But the other fellows
didn't care too much for me either, and
there were nine of them. I felt
superior to them in my way, and I 
didn't like the manner in which we were
all crowded together into the servants' 
elevator. Nor did they like my being
there. In fact, as the warmly lighted 
floors flashed past the elevator we had
words over the fact that I, by taking 
part in the fight, had knocked one of
their friends out of a night's work.
We were led out of the elevator through 
a rococo hall into an
anteroom and told to get into our 
fighting togs. Each of us was issued a 
pair of boxing gloves and ushered out into
the big mirrored hall, which we
entered looking cautiously about us and 
whispering, lest we might accidentally
be heard above the noise of the room. 
It was foggy with cigar smoke. And
already the whiskey was taking effect. 
I was shocked to see some of the most
important men of the town quite tipsy. 
They were all there -- bankers,
lawyers, judges, doctors, fire chiefs, 
teachers, merchants. Even one of the
more fashionable pastors. Something we 
could not see was going on up front.
A clarinet was vibrating sensuously and 
the men were standing up and
moving eagerly forward. We were a small 
tight group, clustered together, our
bare upper bodies touching and shining 
with anticipatory sweat; while up
front the big shots were becoming 
increasingly excited over something we 
still could not see. Suddenly I heard the
school superintendent, who had told me
to come, yell, "Bring up the shines, 
gentlemen! Bring up the little shines!"
We were rushed up to the front of the 
ballroom, where it smelled
even more strongly of tobacco and 
whiskey. Then we were pushed into place.
I almost wet my pants. A sea of faces, 
some hostile, some amused, ringed
around us, and in the center, facing 
us, stood a magnificent blonde -- stark
naked. There was dead silence. I felt a 
blast of cold air chill me. I tried to
back away, but they were behind me and 
around me. Some of the boys stood
with lowered heads, trembling. I felt a 
wave of irrational guilt and fear. My
teeth chattered, my skin turned to 
goose flesh, my knees knocked. Yet I was
strongly attracted and looked in spite 
of myself. Had the price of looking
been blindness, I would have looked. 
The hair was yellow like that of a 
circus kewpie doll, the face heavily
powdered and rouged, as though to form an
abstract mask, the eyes hollow and 
smeared a cool blue, the color of a
baboon's butt. I felt a desire to spit 
upon her as my eyes brushed slowly over
her body. Her breasts were firm and 
round as the domes of East Indian
temples, and I stood so close as to see 
the fine skin texture and beads of
pearly perspiration glistening like dew 
around the pink and erected buds of
her nipples. I wanted at one and the 
same time to run from the room, to
sink through the floor, or go to her 
and cover her from my eyes and the
eyes of the others with my body; to 
feel the soft thighs, to caress her and
destroy her, to love her and murder 
her, to hide from her, and yet to stroke
where below the small American flag 
tattooed upon her belly her thighs
formed a capital V. I had a notion that 
of all in the room she saw only me
with her impersonal eyes.
And then she began to dance, a slow 
sensuous movement; the smoke
of a hundred cigars clinging to her 
like the thinnest of veils. She seemed 
like
a fair bird-girl girdled in veils 
calling to me from the angry surface of 
some
gray and threatening sea. I was 
transported. Then I became aware of the
clarinet playing and the big shots 
yelling at us. Some threatened us if we
looked and others if we did not. On my 
right I saw one boy faint. And now
a man grabbed a silver pitcher from a 
table and stepped close as he dashed
ice water upon him and stood him up and 
forced two of us to support him
as his head hung and moans issued from 
his thick bluish lips. Another boy
began to plead to go home. He was the 
largest of the group, wearing dark
red fighting trunks much too small to 
conceal the erection which projected
from him as though in answer to the 
insinuating low-registered moaning of
the clarinet. He tried to hide himself 
with his boxing gloves.
And all the while the blonde continued 
dancing, smiling faintly at the
big shots who watched her with 
fascination, and faintly smiling at our 
fear. I
noticed a certain merchant who followed 
her hungrily, his lips loose and
drooling. He was a large man who wore 
diamond studs in a shirtfront which
swelled with the ample paunch 
underneath, and each time the blonde 
swayed
her undulating hips he ran his hand 
through the thin hair of his bald head
and, with his arms upheld, his posture 
clumsy like that of an intoxicated
panda, wound his belly in a slow and 
obscene grind. This creature was
completely hypnotized. The music had 
quickened. As the dancer flung herself
about with a detached expression on her 
face, the men began reaching out to
touch her. I could see their beefy 
fingers sink into the soft flesh. Some 
of the
others tried to stop them and she began 
to move around the floor in graceful
circles, as they gave chase, slipping 
and sliding over the polished floor. It 
was

mad. Chairs went crashing, drinks were 
spilt, as they ran laughing and
howling after her. They caught her just 
as she reached a door, raised her
from the floor, and tossed her as 
college boys are tossed at a hazing, and
above her red, fixed-smiling lips I saw 
the terror and disgust in her eyes,
almost like my own terror and that 
which I saw in some of the other boys.
As I watched, they tossed her twice and 
her soft breasts seemed to flatten
against the air and her legs flung 
wildly as she spun. Some of the more
sober ones helped her to escape. And I 
started off the floor, heading for the
anteroom with the rest of the boys.
Some were still crying and in hysteria. 
But as we tried to leave we
were stopped and ordered to get into 
the ring. There was nothing to do but
what we were told. All ten of us 
climbed under the ropes and allowed
ourselves to be blindfolded with broad 
bands of white cloth. One of the men
seemed to feel a bit sympathetic and 
tried to cheer us up as we stood with
our backs against the ropes. Some of us 
tried to grin. "See that boy over
there?" one of the men said. "I want 
you to run across at the bell and give 
it
to him right in the belly. If you don't 
get him, I'm going to get you. I don't
like his looks." Each of us was told 
the same. The blindfolds were put on.
Yet even then I had been going over my 
speech. In my mind each word was
as bright as flame. I felt the cloth 
pressed into place, and frowned so that 
it
would be loosened when I relaxed.
But now I felt a sudden fit of blind 
terror. I was unused to darkness.
It was as though I had suddenly found 
myself in a dark room filled with
poisonous cottonmouths. I could hear 
the bleary voices yelling insistently 
for
the battle royal to begin.
"Get going in there!"
"Let me at that big nigger!"
I strained to pick up the school 
superintendent's voice, as though to
squeeze some security out of that 
slightly more familiar sound.
"Let me at those black sonsabitches!" 
someone yelled.
"No, Jackson, no!" another voice 
yelled. "Here, somebody, help me
hold Jack."
"I want to get at that ginger-colored 
nigger. Tear him limb from
limb," the first voice yelled.
I stood against the ropes trembling. 
For in those days I was what

they called ginger-colored, and he 
sounded as though he might crunch me
between his teeth like a crisp ginger 
cookie.
Quite a struggle was going on. Chairs 
were being kicked about and I
could hear voices grunting as with a 
terrific effort. I wanted to see, to see
more desperately than ever before. But 
the blindfold was as tight as a thick
skin-puckering scab and when I raised 
my gloved hands to push the layers of
white aside a voice yelled, "Oh, no you 
don't, black bastard! Leave that
alone!"
"Ring the bell before Jackson kills him 
a coon!" someone boomed in
the sudden silence. And I heard the 
bell clang and the sound of the feet
scuffling forward.
A glove smacked against my head. I 
pivoted, striking out stiffly as
someone went past, and felt the jar 
ripple along the length of my arm to my
shoulder. Then it seemed as though all 
nine of the boys had turned upon me
at once. Blows pounded me from all 
sides while I struck out as best I 
could.
So many blows landed upon me that I 
wondered if I were not the only
blindfolded fighter in the ring, or if 
the man called Jackson hadn't succeeded
in getting me after all.
Blindfolded, I could no longer control 
my motions. I had no dignity.
I stumbled about like a baby or a 
drunken man. The smoke had become
thicker and with each new blow it 
seemed to sear and further restrict my
lungs. My saliva became like hot bitter 
glue. A glove connected with my head,
filling my mouth with warm blood. It 
was everywhere. I could not tell if the
moisture I felt upon my body was sweat 
or blood. A blow landed hard
against the nape of my neck. I felt 
myself going over, my head hitting the
floor. Streaks of blue light filled the 
black world behind the blindfold. I lay
prone, pretending that I was knocked 
out, but felt myself seized by hands
and yanked to my feet. "Get going, 
black boy! Mix it up!" My arms were like
lead, my head smarting from blows. I 
managed to feel my way to the ropes
and held on, trying to catch my breath. 
A glove landed in my mid-section
and I went over again, feeling as 
though the smoke had become a knife
jabbed into my guts. Pushed this way 
and that by the legs milling around
me, I finally pulled erect and 
discovered that I could see the black,
sweat-washed forms weaving in the 
smoky-blue atmosphere like drunken
dancers weaving to the rapid drum-like 
thuds of blows.

Everyone fought hysterically. It was 
complete anarchy. Everybody
fought everybody else. No group fought 
together for long. Two, three, four,
fought one, then turned to fight each 
other, were

themselves attacked.

Blows landed below the belt and in the 
kidney, with the gloves open as well
as closed, and with my eye partly 
opened now there was not so much terror.
I moved carefully, avoiding blows, 
although not too many to attract 
attention,
fighting from group to group. The boys 
groped about like blind,
crabs crouching to

cautious

protect their mid-sections, their heads 
pulled in short

against their shoulders, their arms 
stretched nervously before them, with 
their
fists testing the smoke-filled air like 
the knobbed feelers of hypersensitive
snails. In one corner I glimpsed a boy 
violently punching the air and heard
him scream in pain as he smashed his 
hand against a ring post. For a
second I saw him bent over holding his 
hand, then going down as a blow
caught his unprotected head. I played 
one group against the other, slipping in
and throwing a punch then stepping out 
of range while pushing the others
into the melee to take the blows 
blindly aimed at me. The smoke was
agonizing and there were no rounds, no 
bells at three minute intervals to
relieve our exhaustion. The room spun 
round me, a swirl of lights, smoke,
sweating bodies surrounded by tense 
white faces. I bled from both nose and
mouth, the blood spattering upon my 
chest.
The men kept yelling, "Slug him, black 
boy! Knock his guts out!"
"Uppercut him! Kill him! Kill that big 
boy!"
Taking a fake fall, I saw a boy going 
down heavily beside me as
though we were felled by a single blow, 
saw a sneaker-clad foot shoot into
his groin as the two who had knocked 
him down stumbled upon him. I
rolled out of range, feeling a twinge 
of nausea.
The harder we fought the more 
threatening the men became. And
yet, I had begun to worry about my 
speech again. How would it go? Would
they recognize my ability? What would 
they give me?
I was fighting automatically when 
suddenly I noticed that one after
another of the boys was leaving the 
ring. I was surprised, filled with 
panic, as
though I had been left alone with an 
unknown danger. Then I understood.
The boys had arranged it among 
themselves. It was the custom for the 
two
men left in the ring to slug it out for 
the winner's prize. I discovered this 
too
late. When the bell sounded two men in 
tuxedoes leaped into the ring and

removed the blindfold. I found myself 
facing Tatlock, the biggest of the gang.
I felt sick at my stomach. Hardly had 
the bell stopped ringing in my ears
than it clanged again and I saw him 
moving swiftly toward me. Thinking of
nothing else to do I hit him smash on 
the nose. He kept coming, bringing
the rank sharp violence of stale sweat. 
His face was a black blank of a face,
only his eyes alive -- with hate of me 
and aglow with a feverish terror from
what had happened to us all. I became 
anxious. I wanted to deliver my
speech and he came at me as though he 
meant to beat it out of me. I
smashed him again and again, taking his 
blows as they came. Then on a
sudden impulse I struck him lightly and 
as we clinched, I whispered, "Fake
like I knocked you out, you can have 
the prize."
"I'll break your behind," he whispered 
hoarsely.
"For them?"
"For me, sonofabitch!"
They were yelling for us to break it up 
and Tatlock spun me half
around with a blow, and as a joggled 
camera sweeps in a reeling scene, I
saw the howling red faces crouching 
tense beneath the cloud of blue-gray
smoke. For a moment the world wavered, 
unraveled, flowed, then my head
cleared and Tatlock bounced before me. 
That fluttering shadow before my
eyes was his jabbing left hand. Then 
falling forward, my head against his
damp shoulder, I whispered,
"I'll make it five dollars more."
"Go to hell!"
But his muscles relaxed a trifle 
beneath my pressure and I breathed,
"Seven?"
"Give it to your ma," he said, ripping 
me beneath the heart.
And while I still held him I butted him 
and moved away. I felt
myself bombarded with punches. I fought 
back with hopeless desperation. I
wanted to deliver my speech more than 
anything else in the world, felt that
only these men could judge truly my 
ability, and now this stupid clown was
ruining my chances. I began fighting 
carefully now, moving in to punch him
and out again with my greater speed. A 
lucky blow to his chin and I had
him going too -- until I heard a loud 
voice yell, "I got my money on the big
boy."
Hearing this, I almost dropped my 
guard. I was confused: Should I

try to win against the voice out there? 
Would not this go against my speech,
and was not this a moment for humility, 
for nonresistance? A blow to my
head as I danced about sent my right 
eye popping like a jack-in-the-box and
settled my dilemma. The room went red 
as I fell. It was a dream fall, my
body languid and fastidious as to where 
to land, until the floor became
impatient and smashed up to meet me. A 
moment later I came to. An
hypnotic voice said FIVE emphatically. 
And I lay there, hazily watching a
dark red spot of my own blood shaping 
itself into a butterfly, glistening and
soaking into the soiled gray world of 
the canvas.
When the voice drawled TEN I was lifted 
up and dragged to a chair.
I sat dazed. My eye pained and swelled 
with each throb of my pounding
heart and I wondered if now I would be 
allowed to speak. I was wringing
wet, my mouth still bleeding. We were 
grouped along the wall now. The other
boys ignored me as they congratulated 
Tatlock and speculated as to how
much they would be paid. One boy 
whimpered over his smashed hand.
Looking up front, I saw attendants in 
white jackets rolling the portable ring
away and placing a small square rug in 
the vacant space surrounded by
chairs. Perhaps, I thought, I will 
stand on the rug to deliver my speech.
Then the M.C. called to us, "Come on up 
here boys and get your
money."
We ran forward to where the men laughed 
and talked in their chairs,
waiting. Everyone seemed friendly now.
"There it is on the rug," the man said. 
I saw the rug covered with
coins of all dimensions and a few 
crumpled bills. But what excited me,
scattered here and there, were the gold 
pieces.
"Boys, it's all yours," the man said. 
"You get all you grab."
"That's

right,

Sambo,"

a

blond

man

said,

winking

at

me

confidentially.
I trembled with excitement, forgetting 
my pain. I would get the gold
and the bills, I thought. I would use 
both hands. I would throw my body
against the boys nearest me to block 
them from the gold.
"Get down around the rug now," the man 
commanded, "and don't
anyone touch it until I give the 
signal."
"This ought to be good," I heard.
As told, we got around the square rug 
on our knees. Slowly the man

raised his freckled hand as we followed 
it upward with our eyes.
I heard, "These niggers look like 
they're about to pray!"
Then, "Ready," the man said. "Go!"
I lunged for a yellow coin lying on the 
blue design of the carpet,
touching it and sending a surprised 
shriek to join those rising around me. I
tried frantically to remove my hand but 
could not let go. A hot, violent force
tore through my body, shaking me like a 
wet rat. The rug was electrified. The
hair bristled up on my head as I shook 
myself free. My muscles jumped, my
nerves jangled, writhed. But I saw that 
this was not stopping the other boys.
Laughing in fear and embarrassment, 
some were holding back and scooping
up the coins knocked off by the painful 
contortions of the others. The men
roared above us as we struggled.
"Pick it up, goddamnit, pick it up!" 
someone called like a bass-voiced
parrot. "Go on, get it!"
I crawled rapidly around the floor, 
picking up the coins, trying to
avoid the coppers and to get greenbacks 
and the gold. Ignoring the shock by
laughing, as I brushed the coins off 
quickly, I discovered that I could 
contain
the electricity -- a contradiction, but 
it works. Then the men began to push
us onto the rug. Laughing 
embarrassedly, we struggled out of 
their hands and
kept after the coins. We were all wet 
and slippery and hard to hold.
Suddenly I saw a boy lifted into the 
air, glistening with sweat like a circus
seal, and dropped, his wet back landing 
flush upon the charged rug, heard
him yell and saw him literally dance 
upon his back, elbows beating a frenzied
tattoo upon the floor, his muscles 
twitching like the flesh of a horse 
stung
my many flies. When he finally rolled 
off, his face was gray and no one
stopped him when he ran from the floor 
amid booming laughter.
"Get the money," the M.C. called. 
"That's good hard American cash!"
And we snatched and grabbed, snatched 
and grabbed. I was careful
not to come too close to the rug now, 
and when I felt the hot whiskey
breath descend upon me like a cloud of 
foul air I reached out and grabbed
the leg of a chair. It was occupied and 
I held on desperately.
"Leggo, nigger! Leggo!"
The huge face wavered down to mine as 
he tried to push me free.
But my body was slippery and he was too 
drunk. It was Mr. Colcord, who
owned a chain of movie houses and 
"entertainment palaces." Each time he

grabbed me I slipped out of his hands. 
It became a real struggle. I feared the
rug more than I did the drunk, so I 
held on, surprising myself for a moment
by trying to topple him upon the rug. 
It was such an enormous idea that I
found myself actually carrying it out. 
I tried not to be obvious, yet when I
grabbed his leg, trying to tumble him 
out of the chair, he raised up roaring
with laughter, and, looking at me with 
soberness dead in the eye, kicked me
viciously in the chest. The chair leg 
flew out of my hand and I felt myself
going and rolled. It was as though I 
had rolled through a bed of hot coals. 
It
seemed a whole century would pass 
before I would roll free, a century in
which I was seared through the deepest 
levels of my body to the fearful
breath within me and the breath seared 
and heated to the point of explosion.
It'll all be over in a flash, I thought 
as I rolled clear. It'll all be over in 
a
flash.
But not yet, the men on the other side 
were waiting, red faces
swollen as though from apoplexy as they 
bent forward in their chairs. Seeing
their fingers coming toward me I rolled 
away as a fumbled football rolls off
the receiver's fingertips, back into 
the coals. That time I luckily sent the 
rug
sliding out of place and heard the 
coins ringing against the floor and the
boys scuffling to pick them up and the 
M.C. calling, "All right, boys, that's
all. Go get dressed and get your money."
I was limp as a dish rag. My back felt 
as though it had been beaten
with wires.
When we had dressed the M.C. came in 
and gave us each five
dollars, except Tatlock, who got ten 
for being last in the ring. Then he told
us to leave. I was not to get a chance 
to deliver my speech, I thought. I was
going out into the dim alley in despair 
when I was stopped and told to go
back. I returned to the ballroom, where 
the men were pushing back their
chairs and gathering in groups to talk.
The M.C. knocked on a table for quiet. 
"Gentlemen," he said, "we
almost forgot an important part of the 
program. A most serious part,
gentlemen. This boy was brought here to 
deliver a speech which he made at
his graduation yesterday . . ."
"Bravo!"
"I'm told that he is the smartest boy 
we've got out there in
Greenwood. I'm told that he knows more 
big words than a pocket-sized

dictionary."
Much applause and laughter.
"So now, gentlemen, I want you to give 
him your attention."
There was still laughter as I faced 
them, my mouth dry, my eye
throbbing. I began slowly, but 
evidently my throat was tense, because 
they
began shouting, "Louder! Louder!"
"We of the younger generation extol the 
wisdom of that great leader
and educator," I shouted, "who first 
spoke these flaming words of wisdom: 'A
ship lost at sea for many days suddenly 
sighted a friendly vessel. From the
mast of the unfortunate vessel was seen 
a signal: "Water, water; we die of
thirst!" The answer from the friendly 
vessel came back: "Cast down your
bucket where you are." The captain of 
the distressed vessel, at last heeding
the injunction, cast down his bucket, 
and it came up full of fresh sparkling
water from the mouth of the Amazon 
River.' And like him I say, and in his
words, 'To those of my race who depend 
upon bettering their condition in a
foreign land, or who underestimate the 
importance of cultivating friendly
relations with the Southern white man, 
who is his next-door neighbor, I
would say: "Cast down your bucket where 
you are" -- cast it down in making
friends in every manly way of the 
people of all races by whom we are
surrounded . . .' "
I spoke automatically and with such 
fervor that I did not realize that
the men were still talking and laughing 
until my dry mouth, filling up with
blood from the cut, almost strangled 
me. I coughed, wanting to stop and go
to one of the tall brass, sand-filled 
spittoons to relieve myself, but a few 
of
the men, especially the superintendent, 
were listening and I was afraid. So I
gulped it down, blood, saliva and all, 
and continued. (What powers of
endurance I had during those days! What 
enthusiasm! What a belief in the
rightness of things!) I spoke even 
louder in spite of the pain. But still 
they
talked and still they laughed, as 
though deaf with cotton in dirty ears. 
So I
spoke with greater emotional emphasis. 
I closed my ears and swallowed blood
until I was nauseated. The speech 
seemed a hundred times as long as 
before,
but I could not leave out a single 
word. All had to be said, each memorized
nuance considered, rendered. Nor was 
that all. Whenever I uttered a word of
three or more syllables a group of 
voices would yell for me to repeat it. I
used the phrase "social responsibility" 
and they yelled:

"What's that word you say, boy?"
"Social responsibility," I said.
"What?"
"Social . . ."
"Louder."
". . . responsibility."
"More!"
"Respon --"
"Repeat!"
"-- sibility."
The room filled with the uproar of 
laughter until, no doubt,
distracted by having to gulp down my 
blood, I made a mistake and yelled a
phrase I had often seen denounced in 
newspaper editorials, heard debated in
private.
"Social . . ."
"What?" they yelled.
". . . equality --"
The laughter hung smokelike in the 
sudden stillness. I opened my
eyes, puzzled. Sounds of displeasure 
filled the room. The M.C. rushed 
forward.
They shouted hostile phrases at me. But 
I did not understand.
A small dry mustached man in the front 
row blared out, "Say that
slowly, son!"
"What sir?"
"What you just said!"
"Social responsibility, sir," I said.
"You weren't being smart, were you, 
boy?" he said, not unkindly.
"No, sir!"
"You sure that about 'equality' was a 
mistake?"
"Oh, yes, sir," I said. "I was 
swallowing blood."
"Well, you had better speak more slowly 
so we can understand. We
mean to do right by you, but you've got 
to know your place at all times. All
right, now, go on with your speech."
I was afraid. I wanted to leave but I 
wanted also to speak and I was
afraid they'd snatch me down.
"Thank you, sir," I said, beginning 
where I had left off, and having

them ignore me as before.
Yet when I finished there was a 
thunderous applause. I was surprised
to see the superintendent come forth 
with a package wrapped in white tissue
paper, and, gesturing for quiet, 
address the men.
"Gentlemen, you see that I did not 
overpraise this boy. He makes a
good speech and some day he'll lead his 
people in the proper paths. And I
don't have to tell you that that is 
important in these days and times. This 
is
a good, smart boy, and so to encourage 
him in the right direction, in the
name of the Board of Education I wish 
to present him a prize in the form of
this . . ."
He paused, removing the tissue paper 
and revealing a gleaming
calfskin brief case.
". . . in the form of this first-class 
article from Shad Whitmore's
shop."
"Boy," he said, addressing me, "take 
this prize and keep it well.
Consider it a badge of office. Prize 
it. Keep developing as you are and some
day it will be filled with important 
papers that will help shape the destiny 
of
your people."
I was so moved that I could hardly 
express my thanks. A rope of
bloody saliva forming a shape like an 
undiscovered continent drooled upon
the leather and I wiped it quickly 
away. I felt an importance that I had 
never
dreamed.
"Open it and see what's inside," I was 
told.
My fingers a-tremble, I complied, 
smelling the fresh leather and
finding an official-looking document 
inside. It was a scholarship to the 
state
college for Negroes. My eyes filled 
with tears and I ran awkwardly off the
floor.
I was overjoyed; I did not even mind 
when I discovered that the
gold pieces I had scrambled for were 
brass pocket tokens advertising a 
certain
make of automobile.
When I reached home everyone was 
excited. Next day the neighbors
came to congratulate me. I even felt 
safe from grandfather, whose deathbed
curse usually spoiled my triumphs. I 
stood beneath his photograph with my
brief case in hand and smiled 
triumphantly into his stolid black 
peasant's
face. It was a face that fascinated me. 
The eyes seemed to follow everywhere

I went.
That night I dreamed I was at a circus 
with him and that he refused
to laugh at the clowns no matter what 
they did. Then later he told me to
open my brief case and read what was 
inside and I did, finding an official
envelope stamped with the state seal; 
and inside the envelope I found another
and another, endlessly, and I thought I 
would fall of weariness. "Them's
years," he said. "Now open that one." 
And I did and in it I found an
engraved document containing a short 
message in letters of gold. "Read it,"
my grandfather said. "Out loud."
"To Whom It May Concern," I intoned. 
"Keep This Nigger-Boy
Running."
I awoke with the old man's laughter 
ringing in my ears.
(It was a dream I was to remember and 
dream again for many years
after. But at that time I had no 
insight into its meaning. First I had to
attend college.)

Chapter 2
It was a beautiful college. The 
buildings were old and covered with
vines and the roads gracefully winding, 
lined with hedges and wild roses that
dazzled the eyes in the summer sun. 
Honeysuckle and purple wisteria hung
heavy from the trees and white 
magnolias mixed with their scents in the
bee-humming air. I've recalled it 
often, here in my hole: How the grass
turned green in the springtime and how 
the mocking birds fluttered their tails
and sang, how the moon shone down on 
the buildings, how the bell in the
chapel tower rang out the precious 
short-lived hours; how the girls in 
bright
summer dresses promenaded the grassy 
lawn. Many times, here at night, I've
closed my eyes and walked along the 
forbidden road that winds past the 
girls'
dormitories, past the hall with the 
clock in the tower, its windows warmly
aglow, on down past the small white 
Home Economics practice cottage, whiter
still in the moonlight, and on down the 
road with its sloping and turning,

paralleling the black powerhouse with 
its engines droning earth-shaking
rhythms in the dark, its windows red 
from the glow of the furnace, on to
where the road became a bridge over a 
dry riverbed, tangled with brush and
clinging vines; the bridge of rustic 
logs, made for trysting, but virginal 
and
untested by lovers; on up the road, 
past the buildings, with the southern
verandas half-a-city-block long, to the 
sudden forking, barren of buildings,
birds, or grass, where the road turned 
off to the insane asylum.
I always come this far and open my 
eyes. The spell breaks and I try
to re-see the rabbits, so tame through 
having never been hunted, that played
in the hedges and along the road. And I 
see the purple and silver of thistle
growing between the broken glass and 
sunheated stones, the ants moving
nervously in single file, and I turn 
and retrace my steps and come back to
the winding road past the hospital, 
where at night in certain wards the gay
student nurses dispensed a far more 
precious thing than pills to lucky boys 
in
the know; and I come to a stop at the 
chapel. And then it is suddenly
winter, with the moon high above and 
the chimes in the steeple ringing and
a sonorous choir of trombones rendering 
a Christmas carol; and over all is a
quietness and an ache as though all the 
world were loneliness. And I stand
and listen beneath the high-hung moon, 
hearing "A Mighty Fortress Is Our
God," majestically mellow on four 
trombones, and then the organ. The sound
floats over all, clear like the night, 
liquid, serene, and lonely. And I stand 
as
for an answer and see in my mind's eye 
the cabins surrounded by empty
fields beyond red clay roads, and 
beyond a certain road a river, sluggish 
and
covered with algae more yellow than 
green in its stagnant stillness; past 
more
empty fields, to the sun-shrunk shacks 
at the railroad crossing where the
disabled veterans visited the whores, 
hobbling down the tracks on crutches
and canes; sometimes pushing the 
legless, thighless one in a red 
wheelchair.
And sometimes I listen to hear if music 
reaches that far, but recall only the
drunken laughter of sad, sad whores. 
And I stand in the circle where three
roads converge near the statue, where 
we drilled four-abreast down the
smooth asphalt and pivoted and entered 
the chapel on Sundays, our uniforms
pressed, shoes shined, minds laced up, 
eyes blind like those of robots to
visitors and officials on the low, 
whitewashed reviewing stand.
It's so long ago and far away that here 
in my invisibility I wonder if
it happened at all. Then in my mind's 
eye I see the bronze statue of the

college Founder, the cold Father 
symbol, his hands outstretched in the
breathtaking gesture of lifting a veil 
that flutters in hard, metallic folds 
above
the face of a kneeling slave; and I am 
standing puzzled, unable to decide
whether the veil is really being 
lifted, or lowered more firmly in place;
whether I am witnessing a revelation or 
a more efficient blinding. And as I
gaze, there is a rustle of wings and I 
see a flock of starlings flighting 
before
me and, when I look again, the bronze 
face, whose empty eyes look upon a
world I have never seen, runs with 
liquid chalk -- creating another 
ambiguity
to puzzle my groping mind: Why is a 
bird-soiled statue more commanding
than one that is clean?
Oh, long green stretch of campus, Oh, 
quiet songs at dusk, Oh, moon
that kissed the steeple and flooded the 
perfumed nights, Oh, bugle that called
in the morning, Oh, drum that marched 
us militarily at noon -- what was
real, what solid, what more than a 
pleasant, time-killing dream? For how
could it have been real if now I am 
invisible? If real, why is it that I can
recall in all that island of greenness 
no fountain but one that was broken,
corroded and dry? And why does no rain 
fall through my recollections, sound
through my memories, soak through the 
hard dry crust of the still so recent
past? Why do I recall, instead of the 
odor of seed bursting in springtime,
only the yellow contents of the cistern 
spread over the lawn's dead grass?
Why? And how? How and why?
The grass did grow and the green leaves 
appeared on the trees and
filled the avenues with shadow and 
shade as sure as the millionaires
descended from the North on Founders' 
Day each spring. And how they
arrived!

Came

smiling,

inspecting,

encouraging,

conversing

in

whispers,

speechmaking into the wide-open ears of 
our black and yellow faces -- and
each leaving a sizeable check as he 
departed. I'm convinced it was the
product

of

a

subtle

magic,

the

alchemy

of

moonlight;

the

school

a

flower-studded wasteland, the rocks 
sunken, the dry winds hidden, the lost
crickets chirping to yellow butterflies.
And oh, oh, oh, those multimillionaires!

THEY were all such a part of that other 
life that's dead that I can't
remember them all. (Time was as I was, 
but neither that time nor that "I"

are any more.) But this one I remember: 
near the end of my junior year I
drove for him during the week he was on 
the campus. A face pink like St.
Nicholas', topped with a shock of silk 
white hair. An easy, informal manner,
even with me. A Bostonian, smoker of 
cigars, teller of polite Negro stories,
shrewd banker, skilled scientist, 
director, philanthropist, forty years a 
bearer
of the white man's burden, and for 
sixty a symbol of the Great Traditions.
We were driving, the powerful motor 
purring and filling me with
pride and anxiety. The car smelled of 
mints and cigar smoke. Students looked
up and smiled in recognition as we 
rolled slowly past. I had just come from
dinner and in bending forward to 
suppress a belch, I accidentally 
pressed the
button on the wheel and the belch 
became a loud and shattering blast of 
the
horn. Folks on the road turned and 
stared.
"I'm awfully sorry, sir," I said, 
worried lest he report me to Dr.
Bledsoe, the president, who would 
refuse to allow me to drive again.
"Perfectly all right. Perfectly."
"Where shall I drive you, sir?"
"Let me see . . ."
Through the rear-view mirror I could 
see him studying a wafer-thin
watch, replacing it in the pocket of 
his checked waistcoat. His shirt was 
soft
silk, set off with a blue-and-white 
polka-dotted bow tie. His manner was
aristocratic, his movements dapper and 
suave.
"It's early to go in for the next 
session," he said. "Suppose you just
drive. Anywhere you like."
"Have you seen all the campus, sir?"
"Yes, I think so. I was one of the 
original founders, you know."
"Gee! I didn't know that, sir. Then 
I'll have to try some of the
roads."
Of course I knew he was a founder, but 
I knew also that it was
advantageous to flatter rich white 
folks. Perhaps he'd give me a large 
tip, or
a suit, or a scholarship next year.
"Anywhere else you like. The campus is 
part of my life and I know
my life rather well."
"Yes, sir."
He was still smiling.
In a moment the green campus with its 
vine-covered buildings was

behind us. The car bounded over the 
road. How was the campus part of his
life, I wondered. And how did one learn 
his life "rather well"?
"Young man, you're part of a wonderful 
institution. It is a great
dream become reality . . ."
"Yes, sir," I said.
"I feel as lucky to be connected with 
it as you no doubt do yourself.
I came here years ago, when all your 
beautiful campus was barren ground.
There were no trees, no flowers, no 
fertile farmland. That was years ago
before you were born . . ."
I listened with fascination, my eyes 
glued to the white line dividing
the highway as my thoughts attempted to 
sweep back to the times of which
he spoke.
"Even your parents were young. Slavery 
was just recently past. Your
people did not know in what direction 
to turn and, I must confess, many of
mine didn't know in what direction they 
should turn either. But your great
Founder did. He was my friend and I 
believed in his vision. So much so,
that sometimes I don't know whether it 
was his vision or mine . . ."
He chuckled softly, wrinkles forming at 
the corners of his eyes.
"But of course it was his; I only 
assisted. I came down with him to
see the barren land and did what I 
could to render assistance. And it has
been my pleasant fate to return each 
spring and observe the changes that the
years have wrought. That has been more 
pleasant and satisfying to me than
my own work. It has been a pleasant 
fate, indeed."
His voice was mellow and loaded with 
more meaning than I could
fathom. As I drove, faded and yellowed 
pictures of the school's early days
displayed in the library flashed across 
the screen of my mind, coming fitfully
and fragmentarily to life -- 
photographs of men and women in wagons 
drawn
by mule teams and oxen, dressed in 
black, dusty clothing, people who seemed
almost without individuality, a black 
mob that seemed to be waiting, looking
with blank faces, and among them the 
inevitable collection of white men and
women in smiles, clear of features, 
striking, elegant and confident. Until 
now,
and although I could recognize the 
Founder and Dr. Bledsoe among them, the
figures in the photographs had never 
seemed actually to have been alive, but
were more like signs or symbols one 
found on the last pages of the
dictionary . . . But now I felt that I 
was sharing in a great work and, with

the car leaping leisurely beneath the 
pressure of my foot, I identified myself
with the rich man reminiscing on the 
rear seat . . .
"A pleasant fate," he repeated, "and I 
hope yours will be as pleasant."
"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir," I said, 
pleased that he wished something
pleasant for me.
But at the same time I was puzzled: How 
could anyone's fate be
pleasant? I had always thought of it as 
something painful. No one I knew
spoke of it as pleasant -- not even 
Woodridge, who made us read Greek
plays.
We were beyond the farthest extension 
of the school-owned lands
now and I suddenly decided to turn off 
the highway, down a road that
seemed unfamiliar. There were no trees 
and the air was brilliant. Far down
the road the sun glared cruelly against 
a tin sign nailed to a barn. A lone
figure bending over a hoe on the 
hillside raised up wearily and waved, 
more
a shadow against the skyline than a man.
"How far have we come?" I heard over my 
shoulder.
"Just about a mile, sir."
"I don't remember this section," he 
said.
I didn't answer. I was thinking of the 
first person who'd mentioned
anything like fate in my presence, my 
grandfather. There had been nothing
pleasant about it and I had tried to 
forget it. Now, riding here in the
powerful car with this white man who 
was so pleased with what he called his
fate, I felt a sense of dread. My 
grandfather would have called this 
treachery
and I could not understand in just what 
way it was. Suddenly I grew guilty
at the realization that the white man 
might have thought so too. What would
he have thought? Did he know that 
Negroes like my grandfather had been
freed during those days just before the 
college had been founded?
As we came to a side road I saw a team 
of oxen hitched to a
broken-down wagon, the ragged driver 
dozing on the seat beneath the shade
of a clump of trees.
"Did you see that, sir?" I asked over 
my shoulder.
"What was it?"
"The ox team, sir."
"Oh! No, I can't see it for the trees," 
he said looking back. "It's good
timber."

"I'm sorry, sir. Shall I turn back?"
"No, it isn't much," he said. "Go on."
I drove on, remembering the lean, 
hungry face of the sleeping man.
He was the kind of white man I feared. 
The brown fields swept out to the
horizon. A flock of birds dipped down, 
circled, swung up and out as though
linked by invisible strings. Waves of 
heat danced above the engine hood. The
tires sang over the highway. Finally I 
overcame my timidity and asked him:
"Sir, why did you become interested in 
the school?"
"I think," he said, thoughtfully, 
raising his voice, "it was because I
felt even as a young man that your 
people were somehow closely connected
with my destiny. Do you understand?"
"Not so clearly, sir," I said, ashamed 
to admit it.
"You have studied Emerson, haven't you?"
"Emerson, sir?"
"Ralph Waldo Emerson."
I was embarrassed because I hadn't. 
"Not yet, sir. We haven't come
to him yet."
"No?" he said with a note of surprise. 
"Well, never mind. I am a
New Englander, like Emerson. You must 
learn about him, for he was
important to your people. He had a hand 
in your destiny. Yes, perhaps that
is what I mean. I had a feeling that 
your people were somehow connected
with my destiny. That what happened to 
you was connected with what would
happen to me . . ."
I slowed the car, trying to understand. 
Through the glass I saw him
gazing at the long ash of his cigar, 
holding it delicately in his slender,
manicured fingers.
"Yes, you are my fate, young man. Only 
you can tell me what it
really is. Do you understand?"
"I think I do, sir."
"I mean that upon you depends the 
outcome of the years I have
spent in helping your school. That has 
been my life's work, not my banking
or my researches, but my first-hand 
organizing of human life."
I saw him now, leaning toward the front 
seat, speaking with an
intensity which had not been there 
before. It was hard not to turn my eyes
from the highway and face him.

"There is another reason, a reason more 
important, more passionate
and, yes, even more sacred than all the 
others," he said, no longer seeming
to see me, but speaking to himself 
alone. "Yes, even more sacred than all 
the
others. A girl, my daughter. She was a 
being more rare, more beautiful,
purer, more perfect and more delicate 
than the wildest dream of a poet. I
could never believe her to be my own 
flesh and blood. Her beauty was a
well-spring of purest water-of-life, 
and to look upon her was to drink and
drink and drink again . . . She was 
rare, a perfect creation, a work of 
purest
art. A delicate flower that bloomed in 
the liquid light of the moon. A nature
not of this world, a personality like 
that of some biblical maiden, gracious
and queenly. I found it difficult to 
believe her my own . . ."
Suddenly he fumbled in his vest pocket 
and thrust something over
the back of the seat, surprising me.
"Here, young man, you owe much of your 
good fortune in attending
such a school to her."
I looked upon the tinted miniature 
framed in engraved platinum. I
almost dropped it. A young woman of 
delicate, dreamy features looked up at
me. She was very beautiful, I thought 
at the time, so beautiful that I did not
know whether I should express 
admiration to the extent I felt it or 
merely
act polite. And yet I seemed to 
remember her, or someone like her, in 
the
past. I know now that it was the 
flowing costume of soft, flimsy 
material that
made for the effect; today, dressed in 
one of the smart, well-tailored, 
angular,
sterile, streamlined, engine-turned, 
air-conditioned modern outfits you see 
in
the women's magazines, she would appear 
as ordinary as an expensive piece
of machine-tooled jewelry and just as 
lifeless. Then, however, I shared
something of his enthusiasm.
"She was too pure for life," he said 
sadly; "too pure and too good
and too beautiful. We were sailing 
together, touring the world, just she 
and I,
when she became ill in Italy. I thought 
little of it at the time and we
continued across the Alps. When we 
reached Munich she was already fading
away. While we were attending an 
embassy party she collapsed. The best
medical science in the world could not 
save her. It was a lonely return, a
bitter voyage. I have never recovered. 
I have never forgiven myself. Everything
I've done since her passing has been a 
monument to her memory."
He became silent, looking with his blue 
eyes far beyond the field

stretching away in the sun. I returned 
the miniature, wondering what in the
world had made him open his heart to 
me. That was something I never did;
it was dangerous. First, it was 
dangerous if you felt like that about 
anything,
because then you'd never get it or 
something or someone would take it away
from you; then it was dangerous because 
nobody would understand you and
they'd only laugh and think you were 
crazy.
"So you see, young man, you are 
involved in my life quite intimately,
even though you've never seen me 
before. You are bound to a great dream
and to a beautiful monument. If you 
become a good farmer, a chef, a
preacher, doctor, singer, mechanic -- 
whatever you become, and even if you
fail, you are my fate. And you must 
write me and tell me the outcome."
I was relieved to see him smiling 
through the mirror. My feelings
were mixed. Was he kidding me? Was he 
talking to me like someone in a
book just to see how I would take it? 
Or could it be, I was almost afraid to
think, that this rich man was just the 
tiniest bit crazy? How could I tell him
his fate? He raised his head and our 
eyes met for an instant in the glass,
then I lowered mine to the blazing 
white line that divided the highway.
The trees along the road were thick and 
tall. We took a curve. Flocks
of quail sailed up and over a field, 
brown, brown, sailing down, blending.
"Will you promise to tell me my fate?" 
I heard.
"Sir?"
"Will you?"
"Right now, sir?" I asked with 
embarrassment.
"It is up to you. Now, if you like."
I was silent. His voice was serious, 
demanding. I could think of no
reply. The motor purred. An insect 
crushed itself against the windshield,
leaving a yellow, mucous smear.
"I don't know now, sir. This is only my 
junior year . . ."
"But you'll tell me when you know?"
"I'll try, sir."
"Good."
When I took a quick glance into the 
mirror he was smiling again. I
wanted to ask him if being rich and 
famous and helping to direct the school
to become what it was, wasn't enough; 
but I was afraid.
"What do you think of my idea, young 
man?" he said.

"I don't know, sir. I only think that 
you have what you're looking
for. Because if I fail or leave school, 
it doesn't seem to me it would be your
fault. Because you helped make the 
school what it is."
"And you think that enough?"
"Yes, sir. That's what the president 
tells us. You have yours, and you
got it yourself, and we have to lift 
ourselves up the same way."
"But that's only part of it, young man. 
I have wealth and a
reputation and prestige -- all that is 
true. But your great Founder had more
than that, he had tens of thousands of 
lives dependent upon his ideas and
upon his actions. What he did affected 
your whole race. In a way, he had the
power of a king, or in a sense, of a 
god. That, I've come to believe, is more
important than my own work, because 
more depends upon you. You are
important because if you fail I have 
failed by one individual, one defective
cog; it didn't matter so much before, 
but now I'm growing old and it has
become very important . . ."
But you don't even know my name, I 
thought, wondering what it was
all about.
". . . I suppose it is difficult for 
you to understand how this concerns
me. But as you develop you must 
remember that I am dependent upon you
to learn my fate. Through you and your 
fellow students I become, let us say,
three hundred teachers, seven hundred 
trained mechanics, eight hundred
skilled farmers, and so on. That way I 
can observe in terms of living
personalities to what extent my money, 
my time and my hopes have been
fruitfully invested. I also construct a 
living memorial to my daughter.
Understand? I can see the fruits 
produced by the land that your great
Founder has transformed from barren 
clay to fertile soil."
His voice ceased and I saw the strands 
of pale blue smoke drifting
across the mirror and heard the 
electric lighter snap back on its cable 
into
place behind the back of the seat.
"I think I understand you better, now, 
sir," I said.
"Very good, my boy."
"Shall I continue in this direction, 
sir?"
"By all means," he said, looking out at 
the countryside. "I've never
seen this section before. It's new 
territory for me."
Half-consciously I followed the white 
line as I drove, thinking about

what he had said. Then as we took a 
hill we were swept by a wave of
scorching air and it was as though we 
were approaching a desert. It almost
took my breath away and I leaned over 
and switched on the fan, hearing its
sudden whirr.
"Thank you," he said as a slight breeze 
filled the car.
We were passing a collection of shacks 
and log cabins now, bleached
white and warped by the weather. 
Sun-tortured shingles lay on the roofs 
like
decks of water-soaked cards spread out 
to dry. The houses consisted of two
square rooms joined together by a 
common floor and roof with a porch in
between. As we passed we could look 
through to the fields beyond. I stopped
the car at his excited command in front 
of a house set off from the rest.
"Is that a log cabin?"
It was an old cabin with its chinks 
filled with chalk-white clay, with
bright new shingles patching its roof. 
Suddenly I was sorry that I had
blundered down this road. I recognized 
the place as soon as I saw the group
of children in stiff new overalls who 
played near a rickety fence.
"Yes, sir. It is a log cabin," I said.
It was the cabin of Jim Trueblood, a 
sharecropper who had brought
disgrace upon the black community. 
Several months before he had caused
quite a bit of outrage up at the 
school, and now his name was never
mentioned above a whisper. Even before 
that he had seldom come near the
campus but had been well liked as a 
hard worker who took good care of his
family's needs, and as one who told the 
old stories with a sense of humor
and a magic that made them come alive. 
He was also a good tenor singer,
and sometimes when special white guests 
visited the school he was brought
up along with the members of a country 
quartet to sing what the officials
called "their primitive spirituals" 
when we assembled in the chapel on 
Sunday
evenings. We were embarrassed by the 
earthy harmonies they sang, but since
the visitors were awed we dared not 
laugh at the crude, high, plaintively
animal sounds Jim Trueblood made as he 
led the quartet. That had all
passed now with his disgrace, and what 
on the part of the school officials
had been an attitude of contempt 
blunted by tolerance, had now become a
contempt sharpened by hate. I didn't 
understand in those pre-invisible days
that their hate, and mine too, was 
charged with fear. How all of us at the
college hated the black-belt people, 
the "peasants," during those days! We

were trying to lift them up and they, 
like Trueblood, did everything it seemed
to pull us down.
"It appears quite old," Mr. Norton 
said, looking across the bare, hard
stretch of yard where two women dressed 
in new blue-and-white checked
ginghams were washing clothes in an 
iron pot. The pot was soot-black and
the feeble flames that licked its sides 
showed pale pink and bordered with
black,

like

flames

in

mourning.

Both

women

moved

with

the

weary,

full-fronted motions of far-gone 
pregnancy.
"It is, sir," I said. "That one and the 
other two like it were built
during slavery times."
"You don't say! I would never have 
believed that they were so
enduring. Since slavery times!"
"That's true, sir. And the white family 
that owned the land when it
was a big plantation still lives in 
town."
"Yes," he said, "I know that many of 
the old families still survive.
And individuals too, the human stock 
goes on, even though it degenerates.
But these cabinsl" He seemed surprised 
and confounded.
"Do you suppose those women know 
anything about the age and
history of the place? The older one 
looks as though she might."
"I doubt it, sir. They -- they don't 
seem very bright."
"Bright?" he said, removing his cigar. 
"You mean that they wouldn't
talk with me?" he asked suspiciously.
"Yes, sir. That's it."
"Why not?"
I didn't want to explain. It made me 
feel ashamed, but he sensed
that I knew something and pressed me.
"It's not very nice, sir. But I don't 
think those women would talk to
us."
"We can explain that we're from the 
school. Surely they'll talk then.
You may tell them who I am."
"Yes, sir," I said, "but they hate us 
up at the school. They never
come there . . ."
"What!"
"No, sir."
"And those children along the fence 
down there?"

"They don't either, sir."
"But why?"
"I don't really know, sir. Quite a few 
folks out this way don't,
though. I guess they're too ignorant. 
They're not interested."
"But I can't believe it."
The children had stopped playing and 
now looked silently at the car,
their arms behind their backs and their 
new over-sized overalls pulled tight
over their little pot bellies as though 
they too were pregnant.
"What about their men folk?"
I hesitated. Why did he find this so 
strange?
"He hates us, sir," I said.
"You say he; aren't both the women 
married?"
I caught my breath. I'd made a mistake. 
"The old one is, sir," I said
reluctantly.
"What happened to the young woman's 
husband?"
"She doesn't have any -- That is . . . 
I --"
"What is it, young man? Do you know 
these people?"
"Only a little, sir. There was some 
talk about them up on the
campus a while back."
"What talk?"
"Well, the young woman is the old 
woman's daughter . . ."
"And?"
"Well, sir, they say . . . you see . . 
. I mean they say the daughter
doesn't have a husband."
"Oh, I see. But that shouldn't be so 
strange. I understand that your
people -- Never mind! Is that all?"
"Well, sir . . ."
"Yes, what else?"
"They say that her father did it."
"What!"
"Yes, sir . . . that he gave her the 
baby."
I heard the sharp intake of breath, 
like a toy balloon suddenly
deflated. His face reddened. I was 
confused, feeling shame for the two 
women
and fear that I had talked too much and 
offended his sensibilities.
"And did anyone from the school 
investigate this matter?" he asked

at last.
"Yes, sir," I said.
"What was discovered?"
"That it was true -- they say."
"But how does he explain his doing such 
a -- a -- such a monstrous
thing?"
He sat back in the seat, his hands 
grasping his knees, his knuckles
bloodless. I looked away, down the 
heat-dazzling concrete of the highway. I
wished we were back on the other side 
of the white line, heading back to the
quiet green stretch of the campus.
"It is said that the man took both his 
wife and his daughter?"
"Yes, sir."
"And that he is the father of both 
their children?"
"Yes, sir."
"No, no, no!"
He sounded as though he were in great 
pain. I looked at him
anxiously. What had happened? What had 
I said?
"Not that! No . . ." he said, with 
something like horror.
I saw the sun blaze upon the new blue 
overalls as the man appeared
around the cabin. His shoes were tan 
and new and he moved easily over the
hot earth. He was a small man and he 
covered the yard with a familiarity
that would have allowed him to walk in 
the blackest darkness with the same
certainty. He came and said something 
to the women as he fanned himself
with a blue bandanna handkerchief. But 
they appeared to regard him sullenly,
barely speaking, and hardly looking in 
his direction.
"Would that be the man?" Mr. Norton 
asked.
"Yes, sir. I think so."
"Get out!" he cried. "I must talk with 
him."
I was unable to move. I felt surprise 
and a dread and resentment of
what he might say to Trueblood and his 
women, the questions he might ask.
Why couldn't he leave them alone!
"Hurry!"
I climbed from the car and opened the 
rear door. He clambered out
and almost ran across the road to the 
yard, as though compelled by some
pressing urgency which I could not 
understand. Then suddenly I saw the two

women turn and run frantically behind 
the house, their movements heavy and
flatfooted. I hurried behind him, 
seeing him stop when he reached the man
and the children. They became silent, 
their faces clouding over, their 
features
becoming soft and negative, their eyes 
bland and deceptive. They were
crouching behind their eyes waiting for 
him to speak -- just as I recognized
that I was trembling behind my own. Up 
close I saw what I had not seen
from the car: The man had a scar on his 
right cheek, as though he had been
hit in the face with a sledge. The 
wound was raw and moist and from time
to time he lifted his handkerchief to 
fan away the gnats.
"I, I --" Mr. Norton stammered, "I must 
talk with you!"
"All right, suh," Jim Trueblood said 
without surprise and waited.
"Is it true . . . I mean did you?"
"Suh?" Trueblood asked, as I looked 
away.
"You have survived," he blurted. "But 
is it true . . .?"
"Suh?" the farmer said, his brow 
wrinkling with bewilderment.
"I'm sorry, sir," I said, "but I don't 
think he understands you."
He ignored me, staring into Trueblood's 
face as though reading a
message there which I could not 
perceive.
"You did and are unharmed!" he shouted, 
his blue eyes blazing into
the black face with something like envy 
and indignation. Trueblood looked
helplessly at me. I looked away. I 
understood no more than he.
"You have looked upon chaos and are not 
destroyed!"
"No suh! I feels all right."
"You do? You feel no inner turmoil, no 
need to cast out the
offending eye?"
"Suh?"
"Answer me!"
"I'm all right, suh," Trueblood said 
uneasily. "My eyes is all right too.
And when I feels po'ly in my gut I 
takes a little soda and it goes away."
"No, no, no! Let us go where there is 
shade," he said, looking about
excitedly and going swiftly to where 
the porch cast a swath of shade. We
followed him. The farmer placed his 
hand on my shoulder, but I shook it off,
knowing that I could explain nothing. 
We sat on the porch in a semicircle in
camp chairs, me between the 
sharecropper and the millionaire. The 
earth
around the porch was hard and white 
from where wash water had long been

thrown.
"How are you faring now?" Mr. Norton 
asked. "Perhaps I could
help."
"We ain't doing so bad, suh. 'Fore they 
heard 'bout what happen to
us out here I couldn't git no help from 
nobody. Now lotta folks is curious
and goes outta they way to help. Even 
the biggity school folks up on the hill,
only there was a catch to it! They 
offered to send us clean outta the 
county,
pay our way and everything and give me 
a hundred dollars to git settled
with. But we likes it here so I told 
'em No. Then they sent a fellow out 
here,
a big fellow too, and he said if I 
didn't leave they was going to turn the
white folks loose on me. It made me mad 
and it made me scared. Them
folks up there to the school is in 
strong with the white folks and that 
scared
me. But I thought when they first come 
out here that they was different from
when I went up there a long time ago 
looking for some book learning and
some points on how to handle my crops. 
That was when I had my own
place. I thought they was trying to 
he'p me, on accounta I got two women
due to birth 'bout the same time.
"But I got mad when I found they was 
tryin' to git rid of us 'cause
they said we was a disgrace. Yessuh, I 
got real mad. So I went down to see
Mr. Buchanan, the boss man, and I tole 
him 'bout it and he give me a note
to the sheriff and tole me to take it 
to him. I did that, jus' like he tole 
me. I
went to the jailhouse and give Sheriff 
Barbour the note and he ask me to tell
him what happen, and I tole him and he 
called in some more men and they
made me tell it again. They wanted to 
hear about the gal lots of times and
they gimme somethin' to eat and drink 
and some tobacco. Surprised me,
'cause I was scared and spectin' 
somethin' different. Why, I guess there 
ain't
a colored man in the county who ever 
got to take so much of the white
folkses' time as I did. So finally they 
tell me not to worry, that they was
going to send word up to the school 
that I was to stay right where I am.
Them big nigguhs didn't bother me, 
neither. It just goes to show yuh that 
no
matter how biggity a nigguh gits, the 
white folks can always cut him down.
The white folks took up for me. And the 
white folks took to coming out here
to see us and talk with us. Some of 'em 
was big white folks, too, from the
big school way cross the State. Asked 
me lots 'bout what I thought 'bout
things, and 'bout my folks and the 
kids, and wrote it all down in a book. 
But

best of all, suh, I got more work now 
than I ever did have before . . ."
He talked willingly now, with a kind of 
satisfaction and no trace of
hesitancy or shame. The old man 
listened with a puzzled expression as he
held an unlit cigar in his delicate 
fingers.
"Things is pretty good now," the farmer 
said. "Ever time I think of
how cold it was and what a hard time we 
was having I gits the shakes."
I saw him bite into a plug of chewing 
tobacco. Something tinkled
against the porch and I picked it up, 
gazing at it from time to time. It was a
hard red apple stamped out of tin.
"You see, suh, it was cold and us 
didn't have much fire. Nothin' but
wood, no coal. I tried to git help but 
wouldn't nobody help us and I couldn't
find no work or nothin'. It was so cold 
all of us had to sleep together; me,
the ole lady and the gal. That's how it 
started, suh."
He cleared his throat, his eyes 
gleaming and his voice taking on a
deep, incantatory quality, as though he 
had told the story many, many times.
Flies and fine white gnats swarmed 
about his wound.
"That's the way it was," he said. "Me 
on one side and the ole lady
on the other and the gal in the middle. 
It was dark, plum black. Black as the
middle of a bucket of tar. The kids was 
sleeping all together in they bed over
in the corner. I must have been the 
last one to go to sleep, 'cause I was
thinking 'bout how to git some grub for 
the next day and 'bout the gal and
the young boy what was startin' to hang 
'round her. I didn't like him and he
kept comin' through my thoughts and I 
made up my mind to warn him away
from the gal. It was black dark and I 
heard one of the kids whimper in his
sleep and the last few sticks of 
kindlin' crackin' and settlin' in the 
stove and
the smell of the fat meat seemed to git 
cold and still in the air just like
meat grease when it gits set in a cold 
plate of molasses. And I was thinkin'
'bout the gal and this boy and feelin' 
her arms besides me and hearing the
ole lady snorin' with a kinda moanin' 
and a-groanin' on the other side. I was
worryin' 'bout my family, how they was 
goin' to eat and all, and I thought
'bout when the gal was little like the 
younguns sleepin' over in the corner
and how I was her favorite over the ole 
lady. There we was, breathin'
together in the dark. Only I could see 
'em in my mind, knowin' 'em like I
do. In my mind I looked at all of 'em, 
one by one. The gal looks just like
the ole lady did when she was young and 
I first met her, only better lookin'.

You know, we gittin' to be a 
better-lookin' race of people . . .
"Anyway, I could hear 'em breathin' and 
though I hadn't been it
made me sleepy. Then I heard the gal 
say, 'Daddy,' soft and low in her sleep
and I looked, tryin' to see if she was 
still awake. But all I can do is smell
her and feel her breath on my hand when 
I go to touch her. She said it so
soft I couldn't be sure I had heard 
anything, so I just laid there 
listenin'.
Seems like I heard a whippoorwill 
callin', and I thought to myself, Go on
away from here, we'll whip ole Will 
when we find him. Then I heard the
clock up there at the school strikin' 
four times, lonesome like.
"Then I got to thinkin' 'bout way back 
when I left the farm and went
to live in Mobile and 'bout a gal I had 
me then. I was young then -- like
this young fellow here. Us lived in a 
two-story house 'longside the river, and
at night in the summertime we used to 
lay in bed and talk, and after she'd
gone off to sleep I'd be awake lookin' 
out at the lights comin' up from the
water and listenin' to the sounds of 
the boats movin' along. They used to
have musicianers on them boats, and 
sometimes I used to wake her up to
hear the music when they come up the 
river. I'd be layin' there and it would
be quiet and I could hear it comin' 
from way, way off. Like when you quail
huntin' and it's getting dark and you 
can hear the boss bird whistlin' tryin' 
to
get the covey together again, and he's 
coming toward you slow and whistlin'
soft, cause he knows you somewhere 
around with your gun. Still he got to
round them up, so he keeps on comin'. 
Them boss quails is like a good man,
what he got to do he do.
"Well, that's the way the boats used to 
sound. Comin' close to you
from far away. First one would be 
comin' to you when you almost sleep and
it sounded like somebody hittin' at you 
slow with a big shiny pick. You see
the pick-point comin' straight at you, 
comin' slow too, and you can't dodge;
only when it goes to hit you it ain't 
no pick a'tall but somebody far away
breakin' little bottles of all kindsa 
colored glass. It's still comin' at you
though. Still comin'. Then you hear it 
close up, like when you up in the
second-story window and look down on a 
wagonful of watermelons, and you
see one of them young juicy melons 
split wide open a-layin' all spread out
and cool and sweet on top of all the 
striped green ones like it's waitin' 
just
for you, so you can see how red and 
ripe and juicy it is and all the shiny
black seeds it's got and all. And you 
could hear the sidewheels splashin' like

they don't want to wake nobody up; and 
us, me and the gal, would lay there
feelin' like we was rich folks and them 
boys on the boats would be playin'
sweet as good peach brandy wine. Then 
the boats would be past and the
lights would be gone from the window 
and the music would be goin' too.
Kinda like when you watch a gal in a 
red dress and a wide straw hat goin'
past you down a lane with the trees on 
both sides, and she's plump and
juicy and kinda switchin' her tail 
'cause she knows you watchin' and you
know she know, and you just stands 
there and watches 'til you can't see
nothin' but the top of her red hat and 
then that goes and you know she
done dropped behind a hill -- I seen me 
a gal like that once. All I could
hear then would be that Mobile gal -- 
name of Margaret -- she be breathin'
beside me, and maybe 'bout that time 
she'd say, 'Daddy, you still 'wake?' and
then I'd grunt, 'Uhhuh' and drop on off 
-- Gent'mens," Jim Trueblood said, "I
likes to recall them Mobile days.
"Well, it was like that when I heard 
Matty Lou say, 'Daddy,' and I
knowed she musta been dreamin' 'bout 
somebody from the way she said it
and I gits mad wonderin' if it's that 
boy. I listen to her mumblin' for a 
while
tryin' to hear if she calls his name, 
but she don't, and I remember that they
say if you put the hand of a person 
who's talkin' in his sleep in warm water
he'll say it all, but the water is too 
cold and I wouldn't have done it anyway.
But I'm realizin' that she's a woman 
now, when I feels her turn and squirm
against me and throw her arm across my 
neck, up where the cover didn't
reach and I was cold. She said 
somethin' I couldn't understand, like a 
woman
says when she wants to tease and please 
a man. I knowed then she was
grown and I wondered how many times 
it'd done happened and was it that
doggone boy. I moved her arm and it was 
soft, but it didn't wake her, so I
called her, but that didn't wake her 
neither. Then I turned my back and tried
to move away, though there wasn't much 
room and I could still feel her
touchin' me, movin' close to me. Then I 
musta dropped into the dream. I
have to tell you 'bout that dream."
I looked at Mr. Norton and stood up, 
thinking that now was a good
time to leave; but he was listening to 
Trueblood so intensely he didn't see
me, and I sat down again, cursing the 
farmer silently. To hell with his
dream!
"I don't quite remember it all, but I 
remember that I was lookin' for

some fat meat. I went to the white 
folks downtown and they said go see Mr.
Broadnax, that he'd give it to me. 
Well, he lives up on a hill and I was
climbin' up there to see him. Seems 
like that was the highest hill in the
world. The more I climbed the farther 
away Mr. Broadnax's house seems to
git. But finally I do reach there. And 
I'm so tired and restless to git to the
man, I goes through the front door! I 
knows it's wrong, but I can't help it. I
goes in and I'm standin' in a big room 
full of lighted candles and shiny
furniture and pictures on the walls, 
and soft stuff on the floor. But I don't
see a livin' soul. So I calls his name, 
but still don't nobody come and don't
nobody answer. So I sees a door and 
goes through that door and I'm in a
big white bedroom, like I seen one time 
when I was a little ole boy and went
to the big house with my Ma. Everything 
in the room was white and I'm
standin' there knowin' I got no 
business in there, but there anyhow. 
It's a
woman's room too. I tries to git out, 
but I don't find the door; and all
around me I can smell woman, can smell 
it gittin' stronger all the time. Then
I looks over in a corner and sees one 
of them tall grandfather clocks and I
hears it strikin' and the glass door is 
openin' and a white lady is steppin' out
of it. She got on a nightgown of soft 
white silky stuff and nothin' else, and
she looks straight at me. I don't know 
what to do. I wants to run, but the
only door I see is the one in the clock 
she's standin' in -- and anyway, I
can't move and this here clock is 
keepin' up a heapa racket. It's gittin' 
faster
and faster all the time. I tries to say 
somethin', but I caint. Then she starts
to screamin' and I thinks I done gone 
deef, 'cause though I can see her
mouth working, I don't hear nothin'. 
Yit I can still hear the clock and I 
tries
to tell her I'm just lookin' for Mr. 
Broadnax but she don't hear me. Instead
she runs up and grabs me around the 
neck and holds tight, tryin' to keep me
out of the clock. I don't know what to 
do then, sho 'nough. I tries to talk to
her, and I tries to git away. But she's 
holdin' me and I'm scared to touch her
cause she's white. Then I gits so 
scared that I throws her on the bed and
tries to break her holt. That woman 
just seemed to sink outta sight, that
there bed was so soft. It's sinkin' 
down so far I think it's going to 
smother
both of us. Then swoosh! all of a 
sudden a flock of little white geese 
flies out
of the bed like they say you see when 
you go to dig for buried money. Lawd!
they hadn't no more'n disappeared than 
I heard a door open and Mr.
Broadnax's voice said, 'They just 
nigguhs, leave 'em do it.' "

How can he tell this to white men, I 
thought, when he knows they'll
say that all Negroes do such things? I 
looked at the floor, a red mist of
anguish before my eyes.
"And I caint stop -- although I got a 
feelin' somethin' is wrong. I git
loose from the woman now and I'm 
runnin' for the clock. At first I 
couldn't
git the door open, it had some kinda 
crinkly stuff like steel wool on the
facing. But I gits it open and gits 
inside and it's hot and dark in there. I
goes up a dark tunnel, up near where 
the machinery is making all that noise
and heat. It's like the power plant 
they got up to the school. It's burnin' 
hot
as iffen the house was caught on fire, 
and I starts to runnin', try-in' to git
out. I runs and runs till I should be 
tired but ain't tired but feelin' more
rested as I runs, and runnin' so good 
it's like flyin' and I'm flyin' and 
sailin'
and floatin' right up over the town. 
Only I'm still in the tunnel. Then way 
up
ahead I sees a bright light like a 
jack-o-lantern over a graveyard. It gits
brighter and brighter and I know I got 
to catch up with it or else. Then all
at once I was right up with it and it 
burst like a great big electric light in
my eyes and scalded me all over. Only 
it wasn't a scald, but like I was
drownin' in a lake where the water was 
hot on the top and had cold numbin'
currents down under it. Then all at 
once I'm through it and I'm relieved to
be out and in the cool daylight agin.
"I wakes up intendin' to tell the ole 
lady 'bout my crazy dream.
Morning done come, and it's gettin' 
almost light. And there I am, lookin'
straight in Matty Lou's face and she's 
beatin' me and scratchin' and tremblin'
and shakin' and cryin' all at the same 
time like she's havin' a fit. I'm too
surprised to move. She's cryin', 
'Daddy, Daddy, oh Daddy,' just like 
that. And
all at once I remember the ole lady. 
She's right beside us snorin' and I 
can't
move 'cause I figgers if I moved it 
would be a sin And I figgers too, that 
if I
don't move it maybe ain't no sin, 
'cause it happened when I was asleep 
-although maybe sometimes a man can 
look at a little ole pigtail gal and see
him a whore -- you'all know that? 
Anyway, I realizes that if I don't move 
the
ole lady will see me. I don't want that 
to happen. That would be worse than
sin. I'm whisperin' to Matty Lou, 
tryin' to keep her quiet and I'm 
figurin' how
to git myself out of the fix I'm in 
without sinnin'. I almost chokes her.
"But once a man gits hisself in a tight 
spot like that there ain't much
he can do. It ain't up to him no 
longer. There I was, tryin' to git away 
with

all my might, yet having to move 
without movin'. I flew in but I had to 
walk
out. I had to move without movin'. I 
done thought 'bout it since a heap, and
when you think right hard you see that 
that's the way things is always been
with me. That's just about been my 
life. There was only one way I can 
figger
that I could git out: that was with a 
knife. But I didn't have no knife, and 
if
you'all ever seen them geld them young 
boar pigs in the fall, you know I
knowed that that was too much to pay to 
keep from sinnin'. Everything was
happenin' inside of me like a fight was 
goin' on. Then just the very thought
of the fix I'm in puts the iron back in 
me.
"Then if that ain't bad enough, Matty 
Lou can't hold out no longer
and gits to movin' herself. First she 
was tryin' to push me away and I'm
tryin' to hold her down to keep from 
sinnin'. Then I'm pullin' away and
shushin' her to be quiet so's not to 
wake her Ma, when she grabs holt to me
and holds tight. She didn't want me to 
go then -- and to tell the
honest-to-God truth I found out that I 
didn't want to go neither. I guess I
felt then, at that time -- and although 
I been sorry since -- just 'bout like
that fellow did down in Birmingham. 
That one what locked hisself in his
house and shot at them police until 
they set fire to the house and burned
him up. I was lost. The more wringlin' 
and twistin' we done tryin' to git
away, the more we wanted to stay. So 
like that fellow, I stayed, I had to
fight it on out to the end. He mighta 
died, but I suspects now that he got a
heapa satisfaction before he went. I 
know there ain't nothin' like what I 
went
through, I caint tell how it was. It's 
like when a real drinkin' man gits 
drunk,
or when a real sanctified religious 
woman gits so worked up she jumps outta
her clothes, or when a real gamblin' 
man keeps on gamblin' when he's losin'.
You got holt to it and you caint let go 
even though you want to."
"Mr. Norton, sir," I said in a choked 
voice, "it's time we were getting
back to the campus. You'll miss your 
appointments . . ."
He didn't even look at me. "Please," he 
said, waving his hand in
annoyance.
Trueblood seemed to smile at me behind 
his eyes as he looked from
the white man to me and continued.
"I couldn't even let go when I heard 
Kate scream. It was a scream to
make your blood run cold. It sounds 
like a woman who was watchin' a team
of wild horses run down her baby chile 
and she caint move. Kate's hair is

standin' up like she done seen a ghost, 
her gown is hanging open and the
veins in her neck is 'bout to bust. And 
her eyes! Lawd, them eyes. I'm lookin'
up at her from where I'm layin' on the 
pallet with Matty Lou, and I'm too
weak to move. She screams and starts to 
pickin' up the first thing that comes
to her hand and throwin' it. Some of 
them misses me and some of them hits
me. Little things and big things. 
Somethin' cold and strong-stinkin' hits 
me
and wets me and bangs against my head. 
Somethin' hits the wall 
-boom-a-loom-a-loom! -- like a cannon 
ball, and I tries to cover up my head.
Kate's talkin' the unknown tongue, like 
a wild woman.
" 'Wait a minit, Kate,' I says. 'Stop 
it!'
"Then I hears her stop a second and I 
hears her runnin' across the
floor, and I twists and looks and Lawd, 
she done got my double-barrel
shotgun!
"And while she's foamin' at the mouth 
and cockin' the gun, she gits
her speech.
" 'Git up! Git up!' she says.
" 'HEY! NAW! KATE!' I says.
" 'Goddam yo' soul to hell! Git up offa 
my chile!'
" 'But woman, Kate, lissen . . .'
" 'Don't talk, MOVE!'
" 'Down that thing, Kate!'
" 'No down, UP!'
" 'That there's buckshot, woman, 
BUCKshot!'
" 'Yes, it is!'
" 'Down it, I say!"
" 'I'm gon blast your soul to hell!'
" 'You gon hit Matty Lou!'
" 'Not Matty Lou

-- YOU!'

" 'It spreads, Kate. Matty Lou!'
"She moves around, aimin' at me.
" 'I done warn you, Jim . . .'
" 'Kate, it was a dream. Lissen to me . 
. .'
" 'You the one who lissen -- UP FROM 
THERE!'
"She jerks the gun and I shuts my eyes. 
But insteada thunder and
lightin' bustin' me, I hears Matty Lou 
scream in my ear,

" 'Mamma! Oooooo, MAMA!'
"I rolls almost over then and Kate 
hesitates. She looks at the gun,
and she looks at us, and she shivers a 
minit like she got the fever. Then all
at once she drops the gun, and ZIP! 
quick as a cat, she turns and grabs
somethin' off the stove. It catches me 
like somebody diggin' into my side with
a sharp spade. I caint breathe. She's 
throwin' and talkin' all at the same 
time.
"And when I looks up, Maan, Maaan! 
she's got a iron in her hand!
"I hollers, 'No blood, Kate. Don't 
spill no blood!'
" 'You low-down dog,' she says, 'it's 
better to spill than to foul!'
" 'Naw, Kate. Things ain't what they 
'pear! Don't make no blood-sin
on accounta no dream-sin!"
" 'Shut up, nigguh. You done fouled!'
"But I sees there ain't no use 
reasonin' with her then. I makes up
my mind that I'm goin' to take whatever 
she gimme. It seems to me that all
I can do is take my punishment. I tell 
myself, Maybe if you suffer for it, it
will be best. Maybe you owe it to Kate 
to let her beat you. You ain't guilty,
but she thinks you is. You don't want 
her to beat you, but she think she got
to beat you. You want to git up, but 
you too weak to move.
"I was too. I was frozen to where I was 
like a youngun what done
stuck his lip to a pump handle in the 
wintertime. I was just like a jaybird
that the yellow jackets done stung 'til 
he's paralyzed -- but still alive in his
eyes and he's watchin' 'em sting his 
body to death.
"It made me seem to go way back a 
distance in my head, behind my
eyes, like I was standin' behind a 
windbreak durin' a storm. I looks out 
and
sees Kate runnin' toward me draggin' 
something behind her. I tries to see
what it is 'cause I'm curious 'bout it 
and sees her gown catch on the stove
and her hand comin' in sight with 
somethin' in it. I thinks to myself, 
It's a
handle. What she got the handle to? 
Then I sees her right up on me, big.
She's swingin' her arms like a man 
swingin' a ten-pound sledge and I sees
the knuckles of her hand is bruised and 
bleedin', and I sees it catch in her
gown and I sees her gown go up so I can 
see her thighs and I sees how
rusty and gray the cold done made her 
skin, and I sees her bend and
straightenin' up and I hears her grunt 
and I sees her swing and I smells her
sweat and I knows by the shape of the 
shinin' wood what she's got to put on
me. Lawd, yes! I sees it catch on a 
quilt this time and raise that quilt up

and drop it on the floor. Then I sees 
that ax come free! It's shinin', shinin'
from the sharpenin' I'd give it a few 
days before, and man, way back in
myself, behind that windbreak, I says,
" 'NAAW! KATE -- Lawd, Kate, NAW!!!' "
Suddenly his voice was so strident that 
I looked up startled.
Trueblood seemed to look straight 
through Mr. Norton, his eyes glassy. The
children paused guiltily at their play, 
looking toward their father.
"I might as well been pleadin' with a 
switch engine," he went on. "I
sees it comin' down. I sees the light 
catchin' on it, I sees Kate's face all
mean and I tightens my shoulders and 
stiffens my neck and I waits -- ten
million back-breakin' years, it seems 
to me like I waits. I waits so long I
remembers all the wrong things I ever 
done; I waits so long I opens my eyes
and closes 'em and opens my eyes agin, 
and I sees it fallin'. It's fallin' 
fast as
flops from a six-foot ox, and while I'm 
waitin' I feels somethin' wind up
inside of me and turn to water. I sees 
it, Lawd, yes! I sees it and seein' it I
twists my head aside. Couldn't help it; 
Kate has a good aim, but for that. I
moves. Though I meant to keep still, I 
moved! Anybody but Jesus Christ
hisself woulda moved. I feel like the 
whole side of my face is smashed clear
off. It hits me like hot lead so hot 
that insteada burnin' me it numbs me.
I'm layin' there on the floor, but 
inside me I'm runnin' round in circles 
like a
dog with his back broke, and back into 
that numbness with my tail tucked
between my legs. I feels like I don't 
have no skin on my face no more, only
the naked bone. But this is the part I 
don't understand: more'n the pain and
numbness I feels relief. Yes, and to 
git some more of that relief I seems to
run out from behind the windbreak again 
and up to where Kate's standin'
with the ax, and I opens my eyes and 
waits. That's the truth. I wants some
more and I waits. I sees her swing it, 
lookin' down on me, and I sees it in
the air and I holds my breath, then all 
of a sudden I sees it stop like
somebody done reached down through the 
roof and caught it, and I sees her
face have a spasm and I sees the ax 
fall, back of her this time, and hit the
floor, and Kate spews out some puke and 
I close my eyes and waits. I can
hear her moanin' and stumblin' out of 
the door and fallin' off the porch into
the yard. Then I hears her pukin' like 
all her guts is coming up by the roots.
Then I looks down and seen blood 
runnin' all over Matty Lou. It's my 
blood,
my face is bleedin'. That gits me to 
movin'. I gits up and stumbles out to

find Kate, and there she is under the 
cottonwood tree out there, on her
knees, and she's moanin'.
" 'What have I done, Lawd! What have I 
done!'
"She's droolin' green stuff and gits to 
pukin' agin, and when I goes
to touch her it gits worse. I stands 
there holdin' my face and tryin' to keep
the blood from flowin' and wonders what 
on earth is gonna happen. I looks
up at the mornin' sun and expects 
somehow for it to thunder. But it's 
already
bright and clear and the sun comin' up 
and the birds is chirpin' and I gits
more afraid then than if a bolt of 
lightnin' had struck me. I yells, 'Have
mercy, Lawd! Lawd, have mercy!' and 
waits. And there's nothin' but the clear
bright mornin' sun.
"But don't nothin' happen and I knows 
then that somethin' worse
than anything I ever heard 'bout is in 
store for me. I musta stood there stark
stone still for half an hour. I was 
still standin' there when Kate got off 
her
knees and went back into the house. The 
blood was runnin' all over my
clothes and the flies was after me, and 
I went back inside to try and stop it.
"When I see Matty Lou stretched out 
there I think she's dead. Ain't
no color in her face and she ain't 
hardly breathin'. She gray in the face. 
I
tries to help her but I can't do no 
good and Kate won't speak to me nor
look at me even; and I thinks maybe she 
plans to try to kill me agin, but
she don't. I'm in such a daze I just 
sits there the whole time while she
bundles up the younguns and takes 'em 
down the road to Will Nichols'. I can
see but I caint do nothin'.
"And I'm still settin' there when she 
comes back with some women
to see 'bout Matty Lou. Won't nobody 
speak to me, though they looks at me
like I'm some new kinda cotton-pickin' 
machine. I feels bad. I tells them how
it happened in a dream, but they scorns 
me. I gits plum out of the house
then. I goes to see the preacher and 
even he don't believe me. He tells me to
git out ot his house, that I'm the most 
wicked man he's ever seen and that I
better go confess my sin and make my 
peace with God. I leaves tryin' to
pray, but I caint. I thinks and thinks, 
until I thinks my brain go'n bust, 'bout
how I'm guilty and how I ain't guilty. 
I don't eat nothin' and I don't drink
nothin' and caint sleep at night. 
Finally, one night, way early in the 
mornin',
I looks up and sees the stars and I 
starts singin'. I don't mean to, I 
didn't
think 'bout it, just start singin'. I 
don't know what it was, some kinda 
church

song, I guess. All I know is I ends up 
singin' the blues. I sings me some
blues that night ain't never been sang 
before, and while I'm singin' them
blues I makes up my mind that I ain't 
nobody but myself and ain't nothin' I
can do but let whatever is gonna 
happen, happen. I made up my mind that I
was goin' back home and face Kate; 
yeah, and face Matty Lou too.
"When I gits here everybody thinks I 
done run off. There's a heap of
women here with Kate and I runs 'em 
out. And when I runs 'em out I sends
the younguns out to play and locks the 
door and tells Kate and Matty Lou
'bout the dream and how I'm sorry, but 
that what done happen is done
happen.
" 'How come you don't go on 'way and 
leave us?' is the first words
Kate says to me. 'Ain't you done enough 
to me and this chile?'
" 'I caint leave you,' I says. 'I'm a 
man and man don't leave his
family.'
"She says, 'Naw, you ain't no man. No 
man'd do what you did.'
" 'I'm still a man,' I says.
" 'But what you gon' do after it 
happens?' says Kate.
" 'After what happens?' I says.
" 'When yo black 'bomination is birthed 
to bawl yo wicked sin befo
the eyes of God!' (She musta learned 
them words from the preacher.)
" 'Birth?' I says. 'Who birth?'
" 'Both of us. Me birth and Matty Lou 
birth. Both of us birth, you
dirty lowdown wicked dog!'
"That liketa killed me. I can 
understand then why Matty Lou won't
look at me and won't speak a word to 
nobody.
" 'If you stay I'm goin' over an' git 
Aunt Cloe for both of us,' Kate
says. She says, 'I don't aim to birth 
no sin for folks to look at all the 
rest of
my life, and I don't aim for Matty Lou 
to neither.'
"You see, Aunt Cloe is a midwife, and 
even weak as I am from this
news I knows I don't want her foolin' 
with my womenfolks. That woulda been
pilin' sin up on toppa sin. So I told 
Kate, naw, that if Aunt Cloe come near
this house I'd kill her, old as she is. 
I'da done it too. That settles it. I 
walks
out of the house and leaves 'em here to 
cry it out between 'em. I wanted to
go off by myself agin, but it don't do 
no good tryin' to run off from
somethin' like that. It follows you 
wherever you go. Besides, to git right 
down

to the facts, there wasn't nowhere I 
could go. I didn't have a cryin' dime!
"Things got to happenin' right off. The 
nigguhs up at the school
come down to chase me off and that made 
me mad. I went to see the white
folks then and they gave me help. 
That's what I don't understand. I done 
the
worse thing a man could ever do in his 
family and instead of chasin' me out
of the county, they gimme more help 
than they ever give any other colored
man, no matter how good a nigguh he 
was. Except that my wife an' daughter
won't speak to me, I'm better off than 
I ever been before. And even if Kate
won't speak to me she took the new 
clothes I brought her from up in town
and now she's gettin' some eyeglasses 
made what she been needin' for so
long. But what I don't understand is 
how I done the worse thing a man can
do in his own family and 'stead of 
things gittin' bad, they got better. The
nigguhs up at the school don't like me, 
but the white folks treats me fine."

HE WAS some farmer. As I listened I had 
been so torn between
humiliation and fascination that to 
lessen my sense of shame I had kept my
attention riveted upon his intense 
face. That way I did not have to look at
Mr. Norton. But now as the voice ended 
I sat looking down at Mr. Norton's
feet. Out in the yard a woman's hoarse 
contralto intoned a hymn. Children's
voices were raised in playful chatter. 
I sat bent over, smelling the sharp dry
odor of wood burning in the hot 
sunlight. I stared at the two pairs of 
shoes
before me. Mr. Norton's were white, 
trimmed with black. They were custom
made and there beside the cheap tan 
brogues of the farmer they had the
elegantly slender well-bred appearance 
of fine gloves. Finally someone cleared
his throat and I looked up to see Mr. 
Norton staring silently into Jim
Trueblood's eyes. I was startled. His 
face had drained of color. With his
bright eyes burning into Trueblood's 
black face, he looked ghostly. Trueblood
looked at me questioningly.
"Lissen to the younguns," he said in 
embarrassment. "Playin' 'London
Bridge's Fallin' Down.' "
Something was going on which I didn't 
get. I had to get Mr. Norton
away.
"Are you all right, sir?" I asked.
He looked at me with unseeing eyes. 
"All right?" he said.

"Yes, sir. I mean that I think it's 
time for the afternoon session," I
hurried on.
He stared at me blankly.
I went to him. "Are you sure you're all 
right, sir?"
"Maybe it's the heat," Trueblood said. 
"You got to be born down here
to stand this kind of heat."
"Perhaps," Mr. Norton said, "it is the 
heat. We'd better go."
He stood shakily, still staring 
intently at Trueblood. Then I saw him
removing

a

red

Moroccan-leather

wallet

from

his

coat

pocket.

The

platinum-framed miniature came with it, 
but he did not look at it this time.
"Here," he said, extending a banknote. 
"Please take this and buy the
children some toys for me."
Trueblood's mouth fell agape, his eyes 
widened and filled with
moisture

as

he

took

the

bill

between

trembling

fingers.

It

was

a

hundred-dollar bill.
"I'm ready, young man," Mr. Norton 
said, his voice a whisper.
I went before him to the car and opened 
the door. He stumbled a
bit climbing in and I gave him my arm. 
His face was still chalk white.
"Drive me away from here," he said in a 
sudden frenzy. "Away!"
"Yes, sir."
I saw Jim Trueblood wave as I threw the 
car into gear. "You
bastard," I

said

under my

breath.

"You

no-good

bastard!

You

get

a

hundred-dollar bill!"
When I had turned the car and started 
back I saw him still standing
in the same place.
Suddenly Mr. Norton touched me on the 
shoulder. "I must have a
stimulant, young man. A little whiskey."
"Yes, sir. Are you all right, sir?"
"A little faint, but a stimulant . . ."
His voice trailed off. Something cold 
formed within my chest. If
anything happened to him Dr. Bledsoe 
would blame me. I stepped on the
gas, wondering where I could get him 
some whiskey. Not in the town, that
would take too long. There was only one 
place, the Golden Day.
"I'll have you some in a few minutes, 
sir," I said.
"As soon as you can," he said.

Chapter 3
I saw them as we approached the short 
stretch that lay between the
railroad tracks and the Golden Day. At 
first I failed to recognize them. They
straggled down the highway in a loose 
body, blocking the way from the white
line to the frazzled weeds that 
bordered the sun-heated concrete slab. I
cursed them silently. They were 
blocking the road and Mr. Norton was
gasping for breath. Ahead of the 
radiator's gleaming curve they looked 
like a
chain gang on its way to make a road. 
But a chain gang marches single file
and I saw no guards on horseback. As I 
drew nearer I recognized the loose
gray shirts and pants worn by the 
veterans. Damn! They were heading for 
the
Golden Day.
"A little stimulant," I heard behind me.
"In a few minutes, sir."
Up ahead I saw the one who thought he 
was a drum major strutting
in front, giving orders as he moved 
energetically in long, hip-swinging 
strides,
a cane held above his head, rising and 
falling as though in time to music. I
slowed the car as I saw him turn to 
face the men, his cane held at chest
level as he shortened the pace. The men 
continued to ignore him, walking
along in a mass, some talking in groups 
and others talking and gesticulating
to themselves.
Suddenly, the drum major saw the car 
and shook his cane-baton at
me. I blew the horn, seeing the men 
move over to the side as I nosed the
car slowly forward. He held his ground, 
his legs braced, hands on hips, and
to keep from hitting him I slammed on 
the brakes.
The drum major rushed past the men 
toward the car, and I heard
the cane bang down upon the hood as he 
rushed toward me.
"Who the hell you think you are, 
running down the army? Give the
countersign. Who's in command of this 
outfit? You trucking bastards was
always too big for your britches. 
Countersign me!"

"This is General Pershing's car, sir," 
I said, remembering hearing that
he responded to the name of his wartime 
Commander-in-Chief. Suddenly the
wild look changed in his eyes and he 
stepped back and saluted with stiff
precision. Then looking suspiciously 
into the back seat, he barked,
"Where's the General?"
"There," I said, turning and seeing Mr. 
Norton raising himself, weak
and white-faced, from the seat.
"What is it? Why have we stopped?"
"The sergeant stopped us, sir . . ."
"Sergeant? What sergeant?" He sat up.
"Is that you, General?" the vet said, 
saluting. "I didn't know you were
inspecting the front lines today. I'm 
very sorry, sir."
"What . . . ?" Mr. Norton said.
"The General's in a hurry," I said 
quickly.
"Sure is," the vet said. "He's got a 
lot to see. Discipline is bad.
Artillery's shot to hell." Then he 
called to the men walking up the road, 
"Get
the hell out of the General's road. 
General Pershing's coming through. Make
way for General Pershing!"
He stepped aside and I shot the car 
across the line to avoid the men
and stayed there on the wrong side as I 
headed for the Golden Day.
"Who was that man?" Mr. Norton gasped 
from the back seat.
"A former soldier, sir. A vet. They're 
all vets, a little shellshocked."
"But where is the attendant?"
"I don't see one, sir. They're harmless 
though."
"Nevertheless, they should have an 
attendant."
I had to get him there and away before 
they arrived. This was their
day to visit the girls, and the Golden 
Day would be pretty rowdy. I wondered
where the rest of them were. There 
should have been about fifty. Well, I
would rush in and get the whiskey and 
leave. What was wrong with Mr.
Norton anyway, why should he get that 
upset over Trueblood? I had felt
ashamed and several times I had wanted 
to laugh, but it had made him sick.
Maybe he needed a doctor. Hell, he 
didn't ask for any doctor. Damn that
bastard Trueblood.
I would run in, get a pint, and run out 
again, I thought. Then he
wouldn't see the Golden Day. I seldom 
went there myself except with some of

the fellows when word got out that a 
new bunch of girls had arrived from
New Orleans. The school had tried to 
make the Golden Day respectable, but
the local white folks had a hand in it 
somehow and they got nowhere. The
best the school could do was to make it 
hot for any student caught going
there.
He lay like a man asleep as I left the 
car and ran into the Golden
Day. I wanted to ask him for money but 
decided to use my own. At the door
I paused; the place was already full, 
jammed with vets in loose gray shirts
and trousers and women in short, 
tight-fitting, stiffly starched gingham
aprons. The stale beer smell struck 
like a club through the noise of voices
and the juke box. Just as I got inside 
the door a stolid-faced man gripped
me by the arm and looked stonily into 
my eyes.
"It will occur at 5:30," he said, 
looking straight through me.
"What?"
"The great all-embracing, absolute 
Armistice, the end of the world!"
he said.
Before I could answer, a small plump 
woman smiled into my face
and pulled him away.
"It's your turn, Doc," she said. "Don't 
let it happen till after me and
you done been upstairs. How come I 
always have to come get you?"
"No, it is true," he said. "They 
wirelessed me from Paris this
morning."
"Then, baby, me an' you better hurry. 
There's lots of money I got to
make in here before that thing happens. 
You hold it back a while, will you?"
She winked at me as she pulled him 
through the crowd toward the
stairs. I elbowed my way nervously 
toward the bar.
Many of the men had been doctors, 
lawyers, teachers, Civil Service
workers; there were several cooks, a 
preacher, a politician, and an artist. 
One
very nutty one had been a psychiatrist. 
Whenever I saw them I felt
uncomfortable. They were supposed to be 
members of the professions toward
which at various times I vaguely 
aspired myself, and even though they 
never
seemed to see me I could never believe 
that they were really patients.
Sometimes it appeared as though they 
played some vast and complicated
game with me and the rest of the school 
folk, a game whose goal was
laughter and whose rules and subtleties 
I could never grasp.

Two men stood directly in front of me, 
one speaking with intense
earnestness. ". . . and Johnson hit 
Jeffries at an angle of 45 degrees from 
his
lower left lateral incisor, producing 
an instantaneous blocking of his entire
thalamic rine, frosting it over like 
the freezing unit of a refrigerator, 
thus
shattering his autonomous nervous 
system and rocking the big brick-laying
creampuff with extreme hyperspasmic 
muscular tremors which dropped him
dead on the extreme tip of his coccyx, 
which, in turn, produced a sharp
traumatic reaction in his sphincter 
nerve and muscle, and then, my dear
colleague, they swept him up, sprinkled 
him with quicklime and rolled him
away in a barrow. Naturally, there was 
no other therapy possible."
"Excuse me," I said, pushing past.
Big Halley was behind the bar, his dark 
skin showing through his
sweat-wet shirt.
"Whatcha saying, school-boy?"
"I want a double whiskey, Halley. Put 
it in something deep so I can
get it out of here without spilling it. 
It's for somebody outside."
His mouth shot out, "Hell, naw!"
"Why?" I asked, surprised at the anger 
in his thyroid eyes.
"You still up at the school, ain't you?"
"Sure."
"Well, those bastards is trying to 
close me up agin, that's why. You
can drink till you blue in the face in 
here, but I wouldn't sell you enough to
spit through your teeth to take 
outside."
"But I've got a sick man out in the 
car."
"What car? You never had no car."
"The white man's car. I'm driving for 
him."
"Ain't you in school?"
"He's from the school."
"Well, who's sick?"
"He is."
"He too good to come in? Tell him we 
don't Jimcrow nobody."
"But he's sick."
"He can die!"
"He's important, Halley, a trustee. 
He's rich and sick and if anything
happens to him, they'll have me packed 
and on my way home."

"Can't help it, school-boy. Bring him 
inside and he can buy enough
to swim in. He can drink outta my own 
private bottle."
He sliced the white heads off a couple 
of beers with an ivory paddle
and passed them up the bar. I felt sick 
inside. Mr. Norton wouldn't want to
come in here. He was too sick. And 
besides I didn't want him to see the
patients and the girls. Things were 
getting wilder as I made my way out.
Supercargo, the white-uniformed 
attendant who usually kept the men quiet
was nowhere to be seen. I didn't like 
it, for when he was upstairs they had
absolutely no inhibitions. I made my 
way out to the car. What could I tell
Mr. Norton? He was lying very still 
when I opened the door.
"Mr. Norton, sir. They refuse to sell 
me whiskey to bring out."
He lay very still.
"Mr. Norton."
He lay like a figure of chalk. I shook 
him gently, feeling dread within
me. He barely breathed. I shook him 
violently, seeing his head wobble
grotesquely. His lips

parted, bluish, revealing a

row of long, slender,

amazingly animal-like teeth.
"SIR!"
In a panic I ran back into the Golden 
Day, bursting through the
noise as through an invisible wall.
"Halley!

Help me, he's dying!"

I tried to get through but no one 
seemed to have heard me. I was
blocked on both sides. They were jammed 
together.
"Halley!"
Two patients turned and looked me in 
the face, their eyes two inches
from my nose.
"What is wrong with this gentleman, 
Sylvester?" the tall one said.
"A man's dying outside!" I said.
"Someone is always dying," the other 
one said.
"Yes, and it's good to die beneath 
God's great tent of sky."
"He's got to have some whiskey!"
"Oh, that's different," one of them 
said and they began pushing a
path to the bar. "A last bright drink 
to keep the anguish down. Step aside,
please!"
"School-boy, you back already?" Halley 
said.

"Give me some whiskey. He's dying!"
"I done told you, school-boy, you 
better bring him in here. He can
die, but I still got to pay my bills."
"Please, they'll put me in jail."
"You going to college, figure it out," 
he said.
"You'd better bring the gentleman 
inside," the one called Sylvester
said. "Come, let us assist you."
We fought our way out of the crowd. He 
was just as I left him.
"Look, Sylvester, it's Thomas 
Jefferson!"
"I was just about to say, I've long 
wanted to discourse with him."
I looked at them speechlessly; they 
were both crazy. Or were they
joking?
"Give me a hand," I said.
"Gladly."
I shook him. "Mr. Norton!"
"We'd better hurry if he's to enjoy his 
drink," one of them said
thoughtfully.
We picked him up. He swung between us 
like a sack of old clothes.
"Hurry!"
As we carried him toward the Golden Day 
one of the men stopped
suddenly and Mr. Norton's head hung 
down, his white hair dragging in the
dust.
"Gentlemen, this man is my grandfather!"
"But he's white, his name's Norton."
"I should know my own grandfather! He's 
Thomas Jefferson and I'm
his grandson -- on the 'field-nigger' 
side," the tall man said.
"Sylvester, I do believe that you're 
right. I certainly do," he said,
staring at Mr. Norton. "Look at those 
features. Exactly like yours -- from the
identical mold. Are you sure he didn't 
spit you upon the earth, fully clothed?"
"No, no, that was my father," the man 
said earnestly.
And he began to curse his father 
violently as we moved for the door.
Halley was there waiting. Somehow he'd 
gotten the crowd to quiet down and
a space was cleared in the center of 
the room. The men came close to look
at Mr. Norton.
"Somebody bring a chair."

"Yeah, let Mister Eddy sit down."
"That ain't no Mister Eddy, man, that's 
John D. Rockefeller,"
someone said.
"Here's a chair for the Messiah."
"Stand back y'all," Halley ordered. 
"Give him some room."
Burnside, who had been a doctor, rushed 
forward and felt for Mr.
Norton's pulse.
"It's solid! This man has a solid 
pulse! Instead of beating, it vibrates.
That's very unusual. Very."
Someone pulled him away. Halley 
reappeared with a bottle and a
glass. "Here, some of y'all tilt his 
head back."
And before I could move, a short, 
pock-marked man appeared and
took Mr. Norton's head between his 
hands, tilting it at arm's length and 
then,
pinching the chin gently like a barber 
about to apply a razor, gave a sharp,
swift movement.
"Pow!"
Mr. Norton's head jerked like a jabbed 
punching bag. Five pale red
lines bloomed on the white cheek, 
glowing like fire beneath translucent 
stone.
I could not believe my eyes. I wanted 
to run. A woman tittered. I saw several
men rush for the door.
"Cut it out, you damn fool!"
"A case of hysteria," the pock-marked 
man said quietly.
"Git the hell out of the way," Halley 
said. "Somebody git that
stool-pigeon attendant from upstairs. 
Git him down here, quick!"
"A mere mild case of hysteria," the 
pock-marked man said as they
pushed him away.
"Hurry with the drink, Halley!"
"Heah, school-boy, you hold the glass. 
This here's brandy I been
saving for myself."
Someone whispered tonelessly into my 
ear, "You see, I told you that
it would occur at 5:30. Already the 
Creator has come." It was the 
stolid-faced
man.
I saw Halley tilt the bottle and the 
oily amber of brandy sloshing
into the glass. Then tilting Mr. 
Norton's head back, I put the glass to 
his lips
and poured. A fine brown stream ran 
from the corner of his mouth, down his

delicate chin. The room was suddenly 
quiet. I felt a slight movement against
my hand, like a child's breast when it 
whimpers at the end of a spell of
crying. The fine-veined eyelids 
flickered. He coughed. I saw a slow red 
flush
creep, then spurt, up his neck, 
spreading over his face.
"Hold it under his nose, school-boy. 
Let 'im smell it."
I waved the glass beneath Mr. Norton's 
nose. He opened his pale
blue eyes. They seemed watery now in 
the red flush that bathed his face. He
tried to sit up, his right hand 
fluttering to his chin. His eyes 
widened, moved
quickly from face to face. Then coming 
to mine, the moist eyes focused with
recognition.
"You were unconscious, sir," I said.
"Where am I, young man?" he asked 
wearily.
"This is the Golden Day, sir."
"What?"
"The Golden Day. It's a kind of 
sporting-and-gambling house," I
added reluctantly.
"Now give him another drinka brandy," 
Halley said.
I poured a drink and handed it to him. 
He sniffed it, closed his eyes
as in puzzlement, then drank; his 
cheeks filled out like small bellows; 
he was
rinsing his mouth.
"Thank you," he said, a little stronger 
now. "What is this place?"
"The Golden Day," said several patients 
in unison.
He looked slowly around him, up to the 
balcony, with its scrolled
and carved wood. A large flag hung lank 
above the floor. He frowned.
"What was this building used for in the 
past?" he said.
"It was a church, then a bank, then it 
was a restaurant and a fancy
gambling house, and now we got it," 
Halley explained. "I think somebody said
it used to be a jail-house too."
"They let us come here once a week to 
raise a little hell," someone
said.
"I couldn't buy a drink to take out, 
sir, so I had to bring you
inside," I explained in dread.
He looked about him. I followed his 
eyes and was amazed to see the
varied expressions on the patients' 
faces as they silently returned his 
gaze.
Some were hostile, some cringing, some 
horrified; some, who when among

themselves were most violent, now 
appeared as submissive as children. And
some seemed strangely amused.
"Are all of you patients?" Mr. Norton 
asked.
"Me, I just runs the joint," Halley 
said. "These here other fellows . .
."
"We're

patients

sent

here

as

therapy,"

a

short,

fat,

very

intelligent-looking man said. "But," he 
smiled, "they send along an attendant,
a kind of censor, to see that the 
therapy fails."
"You're nuts. I'm a dynamo of energy. I 
come to charge my
batteries," one of the vets insisted.
"I'm a student of history, sir," 
another interrupted with dramatic
gestures. "The world moves in a circle 
like a roulette wheel. In the beginning,
black is on top, in the middle epochs, 
white holds the odds, but soon
Ethiopia shall stretch forth her noble 
wings! Then place your money on the
black!" His voice throbbed with 
emotion. "Until then, the sun holds no 
heat,
there's ice in the heart of the earth. 
Two years from now and I'll be old
enough to give my mulatto mother a 
bath, the half-white bitch!" he added,
beginning to leap up and down in an 
explosion of glassy-eyed fury.
Mr. Norton blinked his eyes and 
straightened up.
"I'm a physician, may I take your 
pulse?" Burnside said, seizing Mr.
Norton's wrist.
"Don't pay him no mind, mister. He 
ain't been no doctor in ten
years. They caught him trying to change 
some blood into money."
"I did too!" the man screamed. "I 
discovered it and John D.
Rockefeller stole the formula from me."
"Mr. Rockefeller did you say?" Mr. 
Norton said. "I'm sure you must
be mistaken."
"WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?" a voice 
shouted from the
balcony. Everyone turned. I saw a huge 
black giant of a man, dressed only in
white shorts, swaying on the stairs. It 
was Supercargo, the attendant. I hardly
recognized him without his 
hard-starched white uniform. Usually he 
walked
around threatening the men with a 
strait jacket which he always carried 
over
his arm, and usually they were quiet 
and submissive in his presence. But now
they seemed not to recognize him and 
began shouting curses.
"How you gon keep order in the place if 
you gon git drunk?" Halley

shouted. "Charlene! Charlene!"
"Yeah?" a woman's voice, startling in 
its carrying power, answered
sulkily from a room off the balcony.
"I want you to git that 
stool-pigeoning, joy-killing, 
nut-crushing bum
back in there with you and sober him 
up. Then git him in his white suit and
down here to keep order. We got white 
folks in the house."
A woman appeared on the balcony, 
drawing a woolly pink robe about
her. "Now you lissen here, Halley," she 
drawled, "I'm a woman. If you want
him dressed, you can do it yourself. I 
don't put on but one man's clothes
and he's in N'Orleans."
"Never mind all that. Git that stool 
pigeon sober!"
"I want order down there," Supercargo 
boomed, "and if there's white
folks down there, I wan's double order."
Suddenly there was an angry roar from 
the men back near the bar
and I saw them rush the stairs.
"Get him!"
"Let's give him some order!"
"Out of my way."
Five men charged the stairs. I saw the 
giant bend and clutch the
posts at the top of the stairs with 
both hands, bracing himself, his body
gleaming bare in his white shorts. The 
little man who had slapped Mr.
Norton was in front, and, as he sprang 
up the long flight, I saw the
attendant set himself and kick, 
catching the little man just as he 
reached the
top, hard in the chest, sending him 
backwards in a curving dive into the
midst of the men behind him. Supercargo 
got set to swing his leg again. It
was a narrow stair and only one man 
could get up at a time. As fast as they
rushed up, the giant kicked them back. 
He swung his leg, kicking them down
like a fungo-hitter batting out flies. 
Watching him, I forgot Mr. Norton. The
Golden Day was in an uproar. 
Half-dressed women appeared from the 
rooms
off the balcony. Men hooted and yelled 
as at a football game.
"I WANT ORDER!" the giant shouted as he 
sent a man flying down
the flight of stairs.
"THEY THROWING BOTTLES OF LIQUOR!" a 
woman screamed.
"REAL LIQUOR!"
"That's a order he don't want," someone 
said.

A shower of bottles and glasses 
splashing whiskey crashed against the
balcony. I saw Supercargo snap suddenly 
erect and grab his forehead, his face
bathed in whiskey, "Eeeee!" he cried, 
"Eeeee!" Then I saw him waver, rigid
from his ankles upward. For a moment 
the men on the stairs were
motionless, watching him. Then they 
sprang forward.
Supercargo grabbed wildly at the 
balustrade as they snatched his feet
from beneath him and started down. His 
head bounced against the steps
making a sound like a series of 
gunshots as they ran dragging him by his
ankles, like volunteer firemen running 
with a hose. The crowd surged forward.
Halley yelled near my ear. I saw the 
man being dragged toward the center of
the room.
"Give the bastard some order!"
"Here I'm forty-five and he's been 
acting like he's my old man!"
"So you like to kick, huh?" a tall man 
said, aiming a shoe at the
attendant's head. The flesh above his 
right eye jumped out as though it had
been inflated.
Then I heard Mr. Norton beside me 
shouting, "No, no! Not when
he's down!"
"Lissen at the white folks," someone 
said. "He's the white folks'
man!"
Men were jumping upon Supercargo with 
both feet now and I felt
such an excitement that I wanted to 
join them. Even the girls were yelling,
"Give it to him good!" "He never pays 
me!" "Kill him!"
"Please, y'all, not here! Not in my 
place!"
"You can't speak your mind when he's on 
duty!"
"Hell, no!"
Somehow I got pushed away from Mr. 
Norton and found myself
beside the man called Sylvester.
"Watch this, school-boy," he said. "See 
there, where his ribs are
bleeding?" I nodded my head. "Now don't 
move your eyes."
I watched the spot as though compelled, 
just beneath the lower rib
and above the hip-bone, as Sylvester 
measured carefully with his toe and
kicked as though he were punting a 
football. Supercargo let out a groan 
like
an injured horse.
"Try it, school-boy, it feels so good. 
It gives you relief," Sylvester

said. "Sometimes I get so afraid of him 
I feel that he's inside my head.
There!" he said, giving Supercargo 
another kick.
As I watched, a man sprang on 
Supercargo's chest with both feet and
he lost consciousness. They began 
throwing cold beer on him, reviving him,
only to kick him unconscious again. 
Soon he was drenched in blood and beer.
"The bastard's out cold."
"Throw him out."
"Naw, wait a minute. Give me a hand 
somebody."
They threw him upon the bar, stretching 
him out with his arms
folded across his chest like a corpse.
"Now, let's have a drink!"
Halley was slow in getting behind the 
bar and they cursed him.
"Get back there and serve us, you big 
sack of fat!"
"Gimme a rye!"
"Up here, funk-buster!"
"Shake them sloppy hips!"
"Okay, okay, take it easy," Halley 
said, rushing to pour them drinks.
"Just put y'all's money where your 
mouth is."
With Supercargo lying helpless upon the 
bar, the men whirled about
like maniacs. The excitement seemed to 
have tilted some of the more
delicately balanced ones too far. Some 
made hostile speeches at the top of
their voices against the hospital, the 
state and the universe. The one who
called himself a composer was banging 
away the one wild piece he seemed to
know on the out-of-tune piano, striking 
the keyboard with fists and elbows
and filling in other effects in a bass 
voice that moaned like a bear in agony.
One of the most educated ones touched 
my arm. He was a former chemist
who was never seen without his shining 
Phi Beta Kappa key.
"The men have lost control," he said 
through the uproar. "I think
you'd better leave."
"I'm trying to," I said, "as soon as I 
can get over to Mr. Norton."
Mr. Norton was gone from where I had 
left him. I rushed here and
there through the noisy men, calling 
his name.
When I found him he was under the 
stairs. Somehow he had been
pushed there by the scuffling, reeling 
men and he lay sprawled in the chair
like an aged doll. In the dim light his 
features were sharp and white and his

closed eyes well-defined lines in a 
well-tooled face. I shouted his name 
above
the roar of the men, and got no answer. 
He was out again. I shook him,
gently, then roughly, but still no 
flicker of his wrinkled lids. Then some 
of
the milling men pushed me up against 
him and suddenly a mass of whiteness
was looming two inches from my eyes; it 
was only his face but I felt a
shudder of nameless horror. I had never 
been so close to a white person
before. In a panic I struggled to get 
away. With his eyes closed he seemed
more threatening than with them open. 
He was like a formless white death,
suddenly appeared before me, a death 
which had been there all the time and
which had now revealed itself in the 
madness of the Golden Day.
"Stop screaming!" a voice commanded, 
and I felt myself pulled away.
It was the short fat man.
I clamped my mouth shut, aware for the 
first time that the shrill
sound was coming from my own throat. I 
saw the man's face relax as he
gave me a wry smile.
"That's better," he shouted into my 
ear. "He's only a man. Remember
that. He's only a man!"
I wanted to tell him that Mr. Norton 
was much more than that, that
he was a rich white man and in my 
charge; but the very idea that I was
responsible for him was too much for me 
to put into words.
"Let us take him to the balcony," the 
man said, pushing me toward
Mr. Norton's feet. I moved 
automatically, grasping the thin ankles 
as he
raised the white man by the armpits and 
backed from beneath the stairs. Mr.
Norton's head lolled upon his chest as 
though he were drunk or dead.
The vet started up the steps still 
smiling, climbing backwards a step
at a time. I had begun to worry about 
him, whether he was drunk like the
rest, when I saw three of the girls who 
had been leaning over the balustrade
watching the brawl come down to help us 
carry Mr. Norton up.
"Looks like pops couldn't take it," one 
of them shouted.
"He's high as a Georgia pine."
"Yeah, I tell you this stuff Halley got 
out here is too strong for white
folks to drink."
"Not drunk, ill!" the fat man said. "Go 
find a bed that's not being
used so he can stretch out awhile."
"Sho, daddy. Is there any other little 
favors I can do for you?"

"That'll be enough," he said.
One of the girls ran up ahead. "Mine's 
just been changed. Bring him
down here," she said.
In a few minutes Mr. Norton was lying 
upon a three-quarter bed,
faintly breathing. I watched the fat 
man bend over him very professionally
and feel for his pulse.
"You a doctor?" a girl asked.
"Not now, I'm a patient. But I have a 
certain knowledge."
Another one, I thought, pushing him 
quickly aside. "He'll be all right.
Let him come to so I can get him out of 
here."
"You needn't worry, I'm not like those 
down there, young fellow," he
said. "I really was a doctor. I won't 
hurt him. He's had a mild shock of some
kind."
We watched him bend over Mr. Norton 
again, feeling his pulse,
pulling back his eyelid.
"It's a mild shock," he repeated.
"This here Golden Day is enough to 
shock anybody," a girl said,
smoothing her apron over the smooth 
sensuous roll of her stomach.
Another brushed Mr. Norton's white hair 
away from his forehead and
stroked it, smiling vacantly. "He's 
kinda cute," she said. "Just like a 
little
white baby."
"What kinda ole baby?" the small skinny 
girl asked.
"That's the kind, an ole baby."
"You just like white men, Edna. That's 
all," the skinny one said.
Edna shook her head and smiled as 
though amused at herself. "I sho
do. I just love 'em. Now this one, old 
as he is, he could put his shoes under
my bed any night."
"Shucks, me I'd kill an old man like 
that."
"Kill him nothing," Edna said. "Girl, 
don't you know that all these
rich ole white men got monkey glands 
and billy goat balls? These ole
bastards don't never git enough. They 
want to have the whole world."
The doctor looked at me and smiled. 
"See, now you're learning all
about endocrinology," he said. "I was 
wrong when I told you that he was
only a man; it seems now that he's 
either part goat or part ape. Maybe he's
both."

"It's the truth," Edna said. "I used to 
have me one in Chicago --"
"Now you ain't never been to no 
Chicago, gal," the other one
interrupted.
"How you know I ain't? Two years ago . 
. . Shucks, you don't know
nothing. That ole white man right there 
might have him a coupla jackass
balls!"
The fat man raised up with a quick 
grin. "As a scientist and a
physician I'm forced to discount that," 
he said. "That is one operation that
has yet to be performed." Then he 
managed to get the girls out of the 
room.
"If he should come around and hear that 
conversation," the vet said,
"it would be enough to send him off 
again. Besides, their scientific 
curiosity
might lead them to investigate whether 
he really does have a monkey gland.
And that, I'm afraid, would be a bit 
obscene."
"I've got to get him back to the 
school," I said.
"All right," he said, "I'll do what I 
can to help you. Go see if you
can find some ice. And don't worry."
I went out on the balcony, seeing the 
tops of their heads. They were
still milling around, the juke box 
baying, the piano thumping, and over at 
the
end of the room, drenched with beer, 
Supercargo lay like a spent horse upon
the bar.
Starting down, I noticed a large piece 
of ice glinting in the remains
of an abandoned drink and seized its 
coldness in my hot hand and hurried
back to the room.
The vet sat staring at Mr. Norton, who 
now breathed with a slightly
irregular sound.
"You were quick," the man said, as he 
stood and reached for the ice.
"Swift with the speed of anxiety," he 
added, as if to himself. "Hand me that
clean towel -- there, from beside the 
basin."
I handed him one, seeing him fold the 
ice inside it and apply it to
Mr. Norton's face.
"Is he all right?" I said.
"He will be in a few minutes. What 
happened to him?"
"I took him for a drive," I said.
"Did you have an accident or something?"
"No," I said. "He just talked to a 
farmer and the heat knocked him

out . . . Then we got caught in the mob 
downstairs."
"How old is he?"
"I don't know, but he's one of the 
trustees . . ."
"One of the very first, no doubt," he 
said, dabbing at the blue-veined
eyes. "A trustee of consciousness."
"What was that?" I asked.
"Nothing . . . There now, he's coming 
out of it."
I had an impulse to run out of the 
room. I feared what Mr. Norton
would say to me, the expression that 
might come into his eyes. And yet, I
was afraid to leave. My eyes could not 
leave the face with its flickering lids.
The head moved from side to side in the 
pale glow of the light bulb, as
though denying some insistent voice 
which I could not hear. Then the lids
opened, revealing pale pools of blue 
vagueness that finally solidified into
points that froze upon the vet, who 
looked down unsmilingly.
Men like us did not look at a man like 
Mr. Norton in that manner,
and I stepped hurriedly forward.
"He's a real doctor, sir," I said.
"I'll explain," the vet said. "Get a 
glass of water."
I hesitated. He looked at me firmly. 
"Get the water," he said, turning
to help Mr. Norton to sit up.
Outside I asked Edna for a glass of 
water and she led me down the
hall to a small kitchen, drawing it for 
me from a green old-fashioned cooler.
"I got some good liquor, baby, if you 
want to give him a drink," she
said.
"This will do," I said. My hands 
trembled so that the water spilled.
When I returned, Mr. Norton was sitting 
up unaided, carrying on a
conversation with the vet.
"Here's some water, sir," I said, 
extending the glass.
He took it. "Thank you," he said.
"Not too much," the vet cautioned.
"Your diagnosis is exactly that of my 
specialist," Mr. Norton said,
"and I went to several fine physicians 
before one could diagnose it. How did
you know?"
"I too was a specialist," the vet said.
"But how? Only a few men in the whole 
country possess the

knowledge --"
"Then one of them is an inmate of a 
semi-madhouse," the vet said.
"But there's nothing mysterious about 
it. I escaped for a while -- I went to
France with the Army Medical Corps and 
remained there after the Armistice
to study and practice."
"Oh yes, and how long were you in 
France?" Mr. Norton asked.
"Long enough," he said. "Long enough to 
forget some fundamentals
which I should never have forgotten."
"What fundamentals?" Mr. Norton said. 
"What do you mean?"
The vet smiled and cocked his head. 
"Things about life. Such things
as most peasants and folk peoples 
almost always know through experience,
though seldom through conscious thought 
. . ."
"Pardon me, sir," I said to Mr. Norton, 
"but now that you feel better,
shouldn't we go?"
"Not just yet," he said. Then to the 
doctor, "I'm very interested.
What happened to you?" A drop of water 
caught in one of his eyebrows
glittered like a chip of active 
diamond. I went over and sat on a 
chair. Damn
this vet to hell!
"Are you sure you would like to hear?" 
the vet asked.
"Why, of course."
"Then perhaps the young fellow should 
go downstairs and wait . . ."
The sound of shouting and destruction 
welled up from below as I
opened the door.
"No, perhaps you should stay," the fat 
man said. "Perhaps had I
overheard some of what I'm about to 
tell you when I was a student up there
on the hill, I wouldn't be the casualty 
that I am."
"Sit down, young man," Mr. Norton 
ordered. "So you were a student
at the college," he said to the vet.
I sat down again, worrying about Dr. 
Bledsoe as the fat man told
Mr. Norton of his attending college, 
then becoming a physician and going to
France during the World War.
"Were you a successful physician?" Mr. 
Norton said.
"Fairly so. I performed a few brain 
surgeries that won me some
small attention."
"Then why did you return?"

"Nostalgia," the vet said.
"Then what on earth are you doing here 
in this . . . ?" Mr. Norton
said, "With your ability . . ."
"Ulcers," the fat man said.
"That's terribly unfortunate, but why 
should ulcers stop your career?"
"Not really, but I learned along with 
the ulcers that my work could
bring me no dignity," the vet said.
"Now you sound bitter," Mr. Norton 
said, just as the door flew open.
A brown-skinned woman with red hair 
looked in. "How's white-folks
making out?" she said, staggering 
inside. "White-folks, baby, you done 
come
to. You want a drink?"
"Not now, Hester," the vet said. "He's 
still a little weak."
"He sho looks it. That's how come he 
needs a drink. Put some iron
in his blood."
"Now, now, Hester."
"Okay, okay . . . But what y'all doing 
looking like you at a funeral?
Don't you know this is the Golden Day?" 
she staggered toward me, belching
elegantly and reeling. "Just look at 
y'all. Here school-boy looks like he's
scared to death. And white-folks here 
is acting like y'all two strange 
poodles.
Be happy y'all! I'm going down and get 
Halley to send you up some drinks."
She patted Mr. Norton's cheek as she 
went past and I saw him turn a
glowing red. "Be happy, white-folks."
"Ah hah!" the vet laughed, "you're 
blushing, which means that you're
better. Don't be embarrassed. Hester is 
a great humanitarian, a therapist of
generous nature and great skill, and 
the possessor of a healing touch. Her
catharsis is absolutely tremendous -- 
ha, ha!"
"You do look better, sir," I said, 
anxious to get out of the place. I
could understand the vet's words but 
not what they conveyed, and Mr.
Norton looked as uncomfortable as I 
felt. The one thing which I did know
was that the vet was acting toward the 
white man with a freedom which
could only bring on trouble. I wanted 
to tell Mr. Norton that the man was
crazy and yet I received a fearful 
satisfaction from hearing him talk as he
had to a white man. With the girl it 
was different. A woman usually got
away with things a man never could.
I was

wet with anxiety, but the vet talked 
on, ignoring the

interruption.
"Rest, rest," he said, fixing Mr. 
Norton with his eyes. "The clocks are
all set back and the forces of 
destruction are rampant down below. They
might suddenly realize that you are 
what you are, and then your life 
wouldn't
be worth a piece of bankrupt stock. You 
would be canceled, perforated,
voided, become the recognized magnet 
attracting loose screws. Then what
would you do? Such men are beyond 
money, and with Supercargo down, out
like a felled ox, they know nothing of 
value. To some, you are the great
white father, to others the lyncher of 
souls, but for all, you are confusion
come even into the Golden Day."
"What are you talking about?" I said, 
thinking: Lyncher? He was
getting wilder than the men downstairs. 
I didn't dare look at Mr. Norton,
who made a sound of protest.
The vet frowned. "It is an issue which 
I can confront only by
evading it. An utterly stupid 
proposition, and these hands so 
lovingly trained
to master a scalpel yearn to caress a 
trigger. I returned to save life and I
was refused," he said. "Ten men in 
masks drove me out from the city at
midnight and beat me with whips for 
saving a human life. And I was forced
to the utmost degradation because I 
possessed skilled hands and the belief
that my knowledge could bring me 
dignity -- not wealth, only dignity -- 
and
other men health!"
Then suddenly he fixed me with his 
eyes. "And now, do you
understand?"
"What?" I said.
"What you've heard!"
"I don't know."
"Why?"
I said, "I really think it's time we 
left."
"You see," he said turning to Mr. 
Norton, "he has eyes and ears and
a good distended African nose, but he 
fails to understand the simple facts of
life. Understand. Understand? It's 
worse than that. He registers with his
senses but short-circuits his brain. 
Nothing has meaning. He takes it in but
he doesn't digest it. Already he is -- 
well, bless my soul! Behold! a walking
zombie! Already he's learned to repress 
not only his emotions but his
humanity. He's invisible, a walking 
personification of the Negative, the 
most

perfect achievement of your dreams, 
sir! The mechanical man!"
Mr. Norton looked amazed.
"Tell me," the vet said, suddenly calm. 
"Why have you been
interested in the school, Mr. Norton?"
"Out of a sense of my destined role," 
Mr. Norton said shakily. "I felt,
and I still feel, that your people are 
in some important manner tied to my
destiny."
"What do you mean, destiny?" the vet 
said.
"Why, the success of my work, of 
course."
"I see. And would you recognize it if 
you saw it?"
"Why, of course I would," Mr. Norton 
said indignantly. "I've watched
it grow each year I've returned to the 
campus."
"Campus? Why the campus?"
"It is there that my destiny is being 
made."
The vet exploded with laughter. "The 
campus, what a destiny!" He
stood and walked around the narrow 
room, laughing. Then he stopped as
suddenly as he had begun.
"You will hardly recognize it, but it 
is very fitting that you came to
the Golden Day with the young fellow," 
he said.
"I came out of illness -- or rather, he 
brought me," Mr. Norton said.
"Of course, but you came, and it was 
fitting."
"What do you mean?" Mr. Norton said 
with irritation.
"A little child shall lead them," the 
vet said with a smile. "But
seriously, because you both fail to 
understand what is happening to you. You
cannot see or hear or smell the truth 
of what you see -- and you, looking for
destiny! It's classic! And the boy, 
this automaton, he was made of the very
mud of the region and he sees far less 
than you. Poor stumblers, neither of
you can see the other. To you he is a 
mark on the score-card of your
achievement, a thing and not a man; a 
child, or even less -- a black
amorphous thing. And you, for all your 
power, are not a man to him, but a
God, a force --"
Mr. Norton stood abruptly. "Let us go, 
young man," he said angrily.
"No, listen. He believes in you as he 
believes in the beat of his
heart. He believes in that great false 
wisdom taught slaves and pragmatists
alike, that white is right. I can tell 
you his destiny. He'll do your bidding,

and for that his blindness is his chief 
asset. He's your man, friend. Your man
and your destiny. Now the two of you 
descend the stairs into chaos and get
the hell out of here. I'm sick of both 
of you pitiful obscenities! Get out 
before
I do you both the favor of bashing in 
your heads!"
I saw his motion toward the big white 
pitcher on the washstand and
stepped between him and Mr. Norton, 
guiding Mr. Norton swiftly through the
doorway. Looking back, I saw him 
leaning against the wall making a sound
that was a blending of laughter and 
tears.
"Hurry, the man is as insane as the 
rest," Mr. Norton said.
"Yes, sir," I said, noticing a new note 
in his voice.
The balcony was now as noisy as the 
floor below. The girls and
drunken vets were stumbling about with 
drinks in their hands. Just as we
went past an open door Edna saw us and 
grabbed my arm.
"Where you taking white-folks?" she 
demanded.
"Back to school," I said, shaking her 
off.
"You don't want to go up there, 
white-folks, baby," she said. I tried
to push past her. "I ain't lying," she 
said. "I'm the best little home-maker in
the business."
"Okay, but please let us alone," I 
pleaded. "You'll get me into
trouble."
We were going down the stairs into the 
milling men now and she
started to scream, "Pay me then! If 
he's too good for me, let him pay!"
And before I could stop her she had 
pushed Mr. Norton, and both of
us were stumbling swiftly down the 
stairs. I landed against a man who
looked up with the anonymous 
familiarity of a drunk and shoved me 
hard
away. I saw Mr. Norton spin past as I 
sank farther into the crowd.
Somewhere I could hear the girl 
screaming and Halley's voice yelling, 
"Hey!
Hey! Hey, now!" Then I was aware of 
fresh air and saw that I was near the
door and pushed my way free and stood 
panting and preparing to plunge
back for Mr. Norton -- when I heard 
Halley calling, "Make way y'all!" and
saw him piloting Mr. Norton to the door.
"Whew!" he said, releasing the white 
man and shaking his huge head.
"Thanks, Halley --" I said and got no 
further.
I saw Mr. Norton, his face pale again, 
his white suit rumpled, topple
and fall, his head scraping against the 
screen of the door.

"Hey!"
I opened the door and raised him up.
"Goddamit, out agin," Halley said. "How 
come you bring this white
man here, school-boy?"
"Is he dead?"
"DEAD!" he said, stepping back 
indignantly. "He caint die!"
"What'll I do, Halley?"
"Not in my place, he caint die," he 
said, kneeling.
Mr. Norton looked up. "No one is dead 
or dying," he said acidly.
"Remove your hands!"
Halley fell away, surprised. "I sho am 
glad. You sho you all right? I
thought sho you was dead this time."
"For God's sake, be quiet!" I exploded 
nervously. "You should be glad
that he's all right."
Mr. Norton was visibly angry now, a raw 
place showing on his
forehead, and I hurried ahead of him to 
the car. He climbed in unaided, and
I got under the wheel, smelling the 
heated odor of mints and cigar smoke.
He was silent as I drove away.

Chapter 4
The wheel felt like an alien thing in 
my hands as I followed the
white line of the highway. Heat rays 
from the late afternoon sun arose from
the gray concrete, shimmering like the 
weary tones of a distant bugle blown
upon still midnight air. In the mirror 
I could see Mr. Norton staring out
vacantly upon the empty fields, his 
mouth stern, his white forehead livid
where it had scraped the screen. And 
seeing him I felt the fear balled coldly
within me unfold. What would happen 
now? What would the school officials
say? In my mind I visualized Dr. 
Bledsoe's face when he saw Mr. Norton. I
thought of the glee certain folks at 
home would feel if I were expelled.
Tatlock's grinning face danced through 
my mind. What would the white folks

think who'd sent me to college? Was Mr. 
Norton angry at me? In the Golden
Day he had seemed more curious than 
anything else -- until the vet had
started talking wild. Damn Trueblood. 
It was his fault. If we hadn't sat in 
the
sun so long Mr. Norton would not have 
needed whiskey and I wouldn't have
gone to the Golden Day. And why would 
the vets act that way with a white
man in the house?
I headed the car through the red-brick 
campus gateposts with a sense
of cold apprehension. Now even the rows 
of neat dormitories seemed to
threaten me, the rolling lawns 
appearing as hostile as the gray 
highway with
its white dividing line. As of its own 
compulsion, the car slowed as we passed
the chapel with its low, sweeping 
eaves. The sun shone coolly through the
avenue of trees, dappling the curving 
drive. Students strolled through the
shade, down a hill of tender grass 
toward the brick-red stretch of tennis
courts. Far beyond, players in whites 
showed sharp against the red of the
courts surrounded by grass, a gay vista 
washed by the sun. In the brief
interval I heard a cheer arise. My 
predicament struck me like a stab. I 
had a
sense of losing control of the car and 
slammed on the brakes in the middle
of the road, then apologized and drove 
on. Here within this quiet greenness I
possessed the only identity I had ever 
known, and I was losing it. In this
brief moment of passage I became aware 
of the connection between these
lawns and buildings and my hopes and 
dreams. I wanted to stop the car and
talk with Mr. Norton, to beg his pardon 
for what he had seen; to plead and
show him tears, unashamed tears like 
those of a child before his parent; to
denounce all we'd seen and heard; to 
assure him that far from being like any
of the people we had seen, I hated 
them, that I believed in the principles 
of
the Founder with all my heart and soul, 
and that I believed in his own
goodness and kindness in extending the 
hand of his benevolence to helping
us poor, ignorant people out of the 
mire and darkness. I would do his
bidding and teach others to rise up as 
he wished them to, teach them to be
thrifty, decent, upright citizens, 
contributing to the welfare of all, 
shunning all
but the straight and narrow path that 
he and the Founder had stretched
before us. If only he were not angry 
with me! If only he would give me
another chance!
Tears filled my eyes, and the walks and 
buildings flowed and froze
for a moment in mist, glittering as in 
winter when rain froze on the grass

and foliage and turned the campus into 
a world of whiteness, weighting and
bending both trees and bushes with 
fruit of crystal. Then in the twinkling 
of
my eyes, it was gone, and the here and 
now of heat and greenness returned.
If only I could make Mr. Norton 
understand what the school meant to me.
"Shall I stop at your rooms, sir?" I 
said. "Or shall I take you to the
administration building? Dr. Bledsoe 
might be worried."
"To my rooms, then bring Dr. Bledsoe to 
me," he answered tersely.
"Yes, sir."
In the mirror I saw him dabbing 
gingerly at his forehead with a
crinkled handkerchief. "You'd better 
send the school physician to me also," 
he
said.
I stopped the car in front of a small 
building with white pillars like
those of an old plantation manor house, 
got out and opened the door.
"Mr. Norton, please, sir . . . I'm 
sorry . . . I --"
He looked at me sternly, his eyes 
narrowed, saying nothing.
"I didn't know . . . please . . ."
"Send Dr. Bledsoe to me," he said, 
turning away and swinging up the
graveled path to the building.
I got back into the car and drove 
slowly to the administration
building. A girl waved gaily as I 
passed, a bunch of violets in her hand. 
Two
teachers in dark suits talked 
decorously beside a broken fountain.
The building was quiet. Going upstairs 
I visualized Dr. Bledsoe, with
his broad globular face that seemed to 
take its form from the fat pressing
from the inside, which, as air pressing 
against the membrane of a balloon,
gave it shape and buoyancy. "Old 
Bucket-head," some of the fellows called
him. I never had. He had been kind to 
me from the first, perhaps because of
the letters which the school 
superintendent had sent to him when I 
arrived.
But more than that, he was the example 
of everything I hoped to be:
Influential with wealthy men all over 
the country; consulted in matters
concerning the race; a leader of his 
people; the possessor of not one, but 
two
Cadillacs, a good salary and a soft, 
good-looking and creamy-complexioned
wife. What was more, while black and 
bald and everything white folks poked
fun

at,

he

had

achieved

power

and

authority;

had,

while

black

and

wrinkle-headed, made himself of more 
importance in the world than most
Southern white men. They could laugh at 
him but they couldn't ignore him.

"He's been looking all over for you," 
the girl at the desk said.
When I walked in he looked up from the 
telephone and said, "Never
mind, he's here now," and hung up. 
"Where's Mr. Norton?" he demanded
excitedly. "Is he all right?"
"Yes, sir. I left him at his rooms and 
came to drive you down. He
wishes to see you."
"Is anything wrong?" he said, getting 
up hurriedly and coming around
the desk. I hesitated.
"Well, is there!"
The panicky beating of my heart seemed 
to blur my vision.
"Not now, sir."
"Now? What do you mean?"
"Well, sir, he had some kind of 
fainting spell."
"Aw, my God! I knew something was 
wrong. Why didn't you get in
touch with me?" He grabbed his black 
homburg, starting for the door. "Come
on!"
I followed him, trying to explain. 
"He's all over it now, sir, and we
were too far away for me to phone . . ."
"Why did you take him so far?" he said, 
moving with great bustling
energy.
"But I drove him where he wanted to go, 
sir."
"Where was that?"
"Back of the slave-quarter section," I 
said with dread.
"The quarters! Boy, are you a fool? 
Didn't you know better than to
take a trustee out there?"
"He asked me to, sir."
We were going down the walk now, 
through the spring air, and he
stopped to look at me with 
exasperation, as though I'd suddenly 
told him
black was white.
"Damn what he wants," he said, climbing 
in the front seat beside me.
"Haven't you the sense God gave a dog? 
We take these white folks where we
want them to go, we show them what we 
want them to see. Don't you know
that? I thought you had some sense."
Reaching Rabb Hall, I stopped the car, 
weak with bewilderment.
"Don't sit there," he said. "Come with 
me!"

Just inside the building I got another 
shock. As we approached a
mirror Dr. Bledsoe stopped and composed 
his angry face like a sculptor,
making it a bland mask, leaving only 
the sparkle of his eyes to betray the
emotion that I had seen only a moment 
before. He looked steadily at himself
for a moment; then we moved quietly 
down the silent hall and up the stairs.
A co-ed sat at a graceful table stacked 
with magazines. Before a great
window stood a large aquarium 
containing colored stones and a small 
replica
of a feudal castle surrounded by 
goldfish that seemed to remain 
motionless
despite the fluttering of their lacy 
fins, a momentary motionful suspension 
of
time.
"Is Mr. Norton in his room?" he said to 
the girl.
"Yessir, Dr. Bledsoe, sir," she said. 
"He said to tell you to come in
when you got here."
Pausing at the door I heard him clear 
his throat, then rap softly
upon the panel with his fist.
"Mr. Norton?" he said, his lips already 
a smile. And at the answer I
followed him inside.
It was a large light room. Mr. Norton 
sat in a huge wing chair with
his jacket off. A change of clothing 
lay on the cool bedspread. Above a
spacious fireplace an oil portrait of 
the Founder looked down at me remotely,
benign, sad, and in that hot instant, 
profoundly disillusioned. Then a veil
seemed to fall.
"I've been worried about you, sir," Dr. 
Bledsoe said. "We expected
you at the afternoon session . . ."
Now it's beginning, I thought. Now -And 
suddenly he rushed forward. "Mr. 
Norton, your head!" he cried,
a strange grandmotherly concern in his 
voice. "What happened, sir?"
"It's nothing." Mr. Norton's face was 
immobile. "A mere scratch."
Dr. Bledsoe whirled around, his face 
outraged. "Get the doctor over
here," he said. "Why didn't you tell me 
that Mr. Norton had been injured?"
"I've already taken care of that, sir," 
I said softly, seeing him whirl
back.
"Mr. Norton, Mister Norton! I'm so 
sorry," he crooned. "I thought I
had sent you a boy who was careful, a 
sensible young man! Why we've never
had an accident before. Never, not in 
seventy-five years. I assure you, sir,

that he shall be disciplined, severely 
disciplined!"
"But there was no automobile accident," 
Mr. Norton said kindly, "nor
was the boy responsible. You may send 
him away, we won't need him now."
My eyes suddenly filled. I felt a wave 
of gratitude at his words.
"Don't be kind, sir," Dr. Bledsoe said. 
"You can't be soft with these
people. We mustn't pamper them. An 
accident to a guest of this college 
while
he is in the charge of a student is 
without question the student's fault. 
That's
one of our strictest rules!" Then to 
me: "Return to your dormitory and
remain there until further notice!"
"But it was out of my control, sir," I 
said, "just as Mr. Norton said .
. ."
"I'll

explain,

young

man,"

Mr.

Norton

said

with

a

half-smile.

"Everything will be explained."
"Thank you, sir," I said, seeing Dr. 
Bledsoe looking at me with no
change of expression.
"On second thought," he said, "I want 
you to be in chapel this
evening, understand me, sir?"
"Yes, sir."
I opened the door with a cold hand, 
bumping into the girl who had
been at the table when we went inside.
"I'm sorry," she said. "Looks like you 
have old Bucket-head kind of
mad."
I said nothing as she walked beside me 
expectantly. A red sun cast
its light upon the campus as I started 
for my dormitory.
"Will you take a message to my boy 
friend for me?" she said.
"Who is he?" I said, trying hard to 
conceal my tension and fear.
"Jack Maston," she said.
"Okay, he's in the room next to mine."
"That's swell," she said with a big 
smile. "The dean put me on duty
so I missed him this afternoon. Just 
tell him that I said the grass is green 
. .
."
"What?"
"The grass is green. It's our secret 
code, he'll understand."
"The grass is green," I said.
"That's it. Thank you, lover," she said.

I felt like cursing as I watched her 
hurrying back into the building,
hearing her flat-heeled shoes crunching 
the graveled walk. Here she was
playing with some silly secret code at 
the very minute my fate for the resf of
my life was being decided. The grass 
was green and they'd meet and she'd be
sent home pregnant, but even so, in 
less disgrace than I . . . If only I 
knew
what they were saying about me . . . 
Suddenly I had an idea and ran after
her, into the building and up the 
stairs.
In the hall, fine dust played in a 
shaft of sunlight, stirred by her
hurried passing. But she had 
disappeared. I had thought to ask her 
to listen
at the door and tell me what was said. 
I gave it up; if she were discovered,
I'd have that on my conscience too. 
Besides, I was ashamed for anyone to
know of my predicament, it was too 
stupid to be believed. Down the long
length of the wide hall I heard someone 
unseen skipping down the stairs
singing. A girl's sweet, hopeful voice. 
I left quietly and hurried to my dorm.
I lay in my room with my eyes closed, 
trying to think. The tension
gripped my insides. Then I heard 
someone coming up the hall and 
stiffened.
Had they sent for me already? Nearby a 
door opened and closed, leaving me
as tense as ever. To whom could I turn 
for help? I could think of no one.
No one to whom I could even explain 
what had happened at the Golden Day.
Everything was upset inside me. And Dr. 
Bledsoe's attitude toward Mr.
Norton was the most confusing of all. I 
dared not repeat what he'd said, for
fear that it would lessen my chances of 
remaining in school. It just wasn't
true, I had misunderstood. He couldn't 
have said what I thought he had said.
Hadn't I seen him approach white 
visitors too often with his hat in hand,
bowing humbly and respectfully? Hadn't 
he refused to eat in the dining hall
with white guests of the school, 
entering only after they had finished 
and
then refusing to sit down, but 
remaining standing, his hat in his 
hand, while
he addressed them eloquently, then 
leaving with a humble bow? Hadn't he,
hadn't he? I had seen him too often as 
I peeped through the door between
the dining room and the kitchen, I 
myself. And wasn't his favorite 
spiritual
"Live-a-Humble"? And in the chapel on 
Sunday evenings upon the platform,
hadn't he always taught us to live 
content in our place in a thousand
unambiguous words? He had and I had 
believed him. I had believed without
question his illustrations of the good 
which came of following the Founder's
path. It was my affirmation of life and 
they couldn't send me away for

something I didn't do. They simply 
couldn't. But that vet! He was so crazy
that he corrupted sane men. He had 
tried to turn the world inside out,
goddamn him! He had made Mr. Norton 
angry. He had no right to talk to a
white man as he had, not with me to 
take the punishment . . .
Someone shook me and I recoiled, my 
legs moist and trembling. It
was my roommate.
"What the hell, roomy," he said. "Let's 
go to chow."
I looked at his confident mug; he was 
going to be a farmer.
"I don't have an appetite," I said with 
a sigh.
"Okay now," he said, "you can try to 
kid me but don't say I didn't
wake you."
"No," I said.
"Who're you expecting, a broad-butt gal 
with ballbearing hips?"
"No," I said.
"You'd better stop that, roomy," he 
grinned. "It'll ruin your health,
make you a moron. You ought to take you 
a gal and show her how the
moon rises over all that green grass on 
the Founder's grave, man . . ."
"Go to hell," I said.
He left laughing, opening the door to 
the sound of many footsteps
from the hall: supper time. The sound 
of departing voices. Something of my
life seemed to retreat with them into a 
gray distance, moiling. Then a knock
sounded at the door and I sprang up, my 
heart tense.
A small student wearing a freshman's 
cap stuck his head in the door,
shouting, "Dr. Bledsoe said he wants to 
see you down at Rabb Hall." And
then he was gone before I could 
question him, his footsteps thundering 
down
the hall as he raced to dinner before 
the last bell sounded.

AT MR. NORTON'S door I stopped with my 
hand on the knob,
mumbling a prayer.
"Come in, young man," he said to my 
knock. He was dressed in
fresh linen, the light falling upon his 
white hair as upon silk floss. A small
piece of gauze was plastered to his 
forehead. He was alone.
"I'm sorry, sir," I apologized, "but I 
was told that Dr. Bledsoe wanted
to see me here . . ."

"That's correct," he said, "but Dr. 
Bledsoe had to leave. You'll find
him in his office after chapel."
"Thank you, sir," I said and turned to 
go. He cleared his throat
behind me. "Young man . . ."
I turned hopefully.
"Young man, I have explained to Dr. 
Bledsoe that you were not at
fault. I believe he understands."
I was so relieved that at first I could 
only look at him, a small
silken-haired, white-suited St. 
Nicholas, seen through misty eyes.
"I certainly do thank you, sir," I 
managed finally.
He studied me silently, his eyes 
slightly narrowed.
"Will you need me this evening, sir?" I 
asked.
"No, I won't be needing the machine. 
Business is taking me away
sooner than I expected. I leave late 
tonight."
"I could drive you to the station, 
sir," I said hopefully.
"Thank you, but Dr. Bledsoe has already 
arranged it."
"Oh," I said with disappointment. I had 
hoped that by serving him
the rest of the week I could win back 
his esteem. Now I would not have the
opportunity.
"Well, I hope you have a pleasant trip, 
sir," I said.
"Thank you," he said, suddenly smiling.
"And maybe next time you come I'll be 
able to answer some of the
questions you asked me this afternoon."
"Questions?" His eyes narrowed.
"Yes, sir, about . . . about your 
fate," I said.
"Ah, yes, yes," he said.
"And I intend to read Emerson, too . . 
."
"Very good. Self-reliance is a most 
worthy virtue. I shall look forward
with the greatest of interest to 
learning your contribution to my fate." 
He
motioned me toward the door. "And don't 
forget to see Dr. Bledsoe."
I left somewhat reassured, but not 
completely. I still had to face Dr.
Bledsoe. And I had to attend chapel.

Chapter 5
At the sound of vespers I moved across 
the campus with groups of
students, walking slowly, their voices 
soft in the mellow dusk. I remember the
yellowed globes of frosted glass making 
lacy silhouettes on the gravel and the
walk of the leaves and branches above 
us as we moved slow through the
dusk so restless with scents of lilac, 
honeysuckle and verbena, and the feel of
spring greenness; and I recall the 
sudden arpeggios of laughter lilting 
across
the tender, springtime grass -- 
gay-welling, far-floating, fluent, 
spontaneous, a
bell-like feminine fluting, then 
suppressed; as though snuffed swiftly 
and
irrevocably beneath the quiet solemnity 
of the vespered air now vibrant with
somber chapel bells. Dong! Dong! Dong! 
Above the decorous walking around
me, sounds of footsteps leaving the 
verandas of far-flung buildings and
moving toward the walks and over the 
walks to the asphalt drives lined with
whitewashed stones, those cryptic 
messages for men and women, boys and
girls heading quietly toward where the 
visitors waited, and we moving not in
the mood of worship but of judgment; as 
though even here in the filtering
dusk, here beneath the deep indigo sky, 
here, alive with looping swifts and
darting moths, here in the hereness of 
the night not yet lighted by the moon
that looms blood-red behind the chapel 
like a fallen sun, its radiance
shedding not upon the here-dusk of 
twittering bats, nor on the there-night 
of
cricket

and

whippoorwill,

but

focused

short-rayed

upon

our

place

of

convergence; and we drifting forward 
with rigid motions, limbs stiff and
voices now silent, as though on exhibit 
even in the dark, and the moon a
white man's bloodshot eye.
And I move more rigid than all the 
others with a sense of judgment;
the vibrations of the chapel bells 
stirring the depths of my turmoil, 
moving
toward its nexus with a sense of doom. 
And I remember the chapel with its
sweeping eaves, long and low as though 
risen bloody from the earth like the
rising moon; vine-covered and 
earth-colored as though more 
earth-sprung
than man-sprung. And my mind rushing 
for relief away from the spring dusk
and flower scents, away from the 
time-scene of the crucifixion to the
time-mood of the birth; from 
spring-dusk and vespers to the high, 
clear, lucid

moon of winter and snow glinting upon 
the dwarfed pines where instead of
the bells, the organ and the trombone 
choir speak carols to the distances
drifted with snow, making of the night 
air a sea of crystal water lapping the
slumbering land to the farthest reaches 
of sound, for endless miles, bringing
the new dispensation even to the Golden 
Day, even unto the house of
madness. But in the hereness of dusk I 
am moving toward the doomlike bells
through the flowered air, beneath the 
rising moon.
Into the doors and into the soft lights 
I go, silently, past the rows of
puritanical benches straight and 
torturous, finding that to which I am
assigned and bending my body to its 
agony. There at the head of the
platform with its pulpit and rail of 
polished brass are the banked and
pyramided heads of the student choir, 
faces composed and stolid above
uniforms of black and white; and above 
them, stretching to the ceiling, the
organ pipes looming, a gothic hierarchy 
of dull gilded gold.
Around me the students move with faces 
frozen in solemn masks,
and I seem to hear already the voices 
mechanically raised in the songs the
visitors

loved.

(Loved?

Demanded.

Sung?

An

ultimatum

accepted

and

ritualized, an allegiance recited for 
the peace it imparted, and for that
perhaps loved. Loved as the defeated 
come to love the symbols of their
conquerors. A gesture of acceptance, of 
terms laid down and reluctantly
approved.) And here, sitting rigid, I 
remember the evenings spent before the
sweeping platform in awe and in 
pleasure, and in the pleasure of awe;
remember the short formal sermons 
intoned from the pulpit there, rendered
in smooth articulate tones, with calm 
assurance purged of that wild emotion
of the crude preachers most of us knew 
in our home towns and of whom we
were deeply ashamed, these logical 
appeals which reached us more like the
thrust of a firm and formal design 
requiring nothing more than the lucidity
of uncluttered periods, the lulling 
movement of multisyllabic words to 
thrill
and console us. And I remember, too, 
the talks of visiting speakers, all 
eager
to inform us of how fortunate we were 
to be a part of the "vast" and formal
ritual. How fortunate to belong to this 
family sheltered from those lost in
ignorance and darkness.
Here upon this stage the black rite of 
Horatio Alger was performed
to

God's

own

acting

script,

with

millionaires

come

down

to

portray

themselves; not merely acting out the 
myth of their goodness, and wealth and

success and power and benevolence and 
authority in cardboard masks, but
themselves, these virtues concretely! 
Not the wafer and the wine, but the 
flesh
and the blood, vibrant and alive, and 
vibrant even when stooped, ancient and
withered. (And who, in face of this, 
would not believe? Could even doubt?)
And I remember too, how we confronted 
those others, those who had
set me here in this Eden, whom we knew 
though we didn't know, who were
unfamiliar in their familiarity, who 
trailed their words to us through blood
and violence and ridicule and 
condescension with drawling smiles, and 
who
exhorted and threatened, intimidated 
with innocent words as they described to
us the limitations of our lives and the 
vast boldness of our aspirations, the
staggering folly of our impatience to 
rise even higher; who, as they talked,
aroused furtive visions within me of 
blood-froth sparkling their chins like
their familiar tobacco juice, and upon 
their lips the curdled milk of a million
black slave mammies' withered dugs, a 
treacherous and fluid knowledge of
our being, imbibed at our source and 
now regurgitated foul upon us. This
was our world, they said as they 
described it to us, this our horizon 
and its
earth, its seasons and its climate, its 
spring and its summer, and its fall and
harvest some unknown millennium ahead; 
and these its floods and cyclones
and they themselves our thunder and 
lightning; and this we must accept and
love and accept even if we did not 
love. We must accept -- even when those
were absent, and the men who made the 
railroads and ships and towers of
stone, were before our eyes, in the 
flesh, their voices different, 
unweighted
with recognizable danger and their 
delight in our songs more sincere 
seeming,
their regard for our welfare marked by 
an almost benign and impersonal
indifference. But the words of the 
others were stronger than the strength 
of
philanthropic dollars, deeper than 
shafts sunk in the earth for oil and 
gold,
more awe-inspiring than the miracles 
fabricated in scientific laboratories. 
For
their most innocent words were acts of 
violence to which we of the campus
were hypersensitive though we endured 
them not.
And there on the platform I too had 
stridden and debated, a student
leader directing my voice at the 
highest beams and farthest rafters, 
ringing
them, the accents staccato upon the 
ridgepole and echoing back with a
tinkling, like words hurled to the 
trees of a wilderness, or into a well of
slate-gray water; more sound than 
sense, a play upon the resonances of
buildings, an assault upon the temples 
of the ear:

Ha! to the gray-haired matron in the 
final row. Ha! Miss Susie, Miss
Susie Gresham, back there looking at 
that co-ed smiling at that he-ed 
-listen to me, the bungling bugler of 
words, imitating the trumpet and the
trombone's timbre, playing thematic 
variations like a baritone horn. Hey! 
old
connoisseur of voice sounds, of voices 
without messages, of newsless winds,
listen to the vowel sounds and the 
crackling dentals, to the low harsh
gutturals of empty anguish, now riding 
the curve of a preacher's rhythm I
heard long ago in a Baptist church, 
stripped now of its imagery: No suns
having hemorrhages, no moons weeping 
tears, no earthworms refusing the
sacred

flesh

and

dancing

in

the

earth

on

Easter

morn.

Ha!

singing

achievement, Ha! booming success, 
intoning, Ha! acceptance, Ha! a river of
word-sounds filled with drowned 
passions, floating, Ha! with wrecks of
unachievable ambitions and stillborn 
revolts, sweeping their ears, Ha! ranged
stiff before me, necks stretched 
forward with listening ears, Ha! 
a-spraying the
ceiling and a-drumming the dark-stained 
after rafter, that seasoned crossarm
of torturous timber mellowed in the 
kiln of a thousand voices; playing Ha! 
as
upon a xylophone; words marching like 
the student band, up the campus and
down again, blaring triumphant sounds 
empty of triumphs. Hey, Miss Susie!
the

sound

of

words

that

were

no

words,

counterfeit

notes

singing

achievements yet unachieved, riding 
upon the wings of my voice out to you,
old matron, who knew the voice sounds 
of the Founder and knew the accents
and echo of his promise; your gray old 
head cocked with the young around
you, your eyes closed, face ecstatic, 
as I toss the word sounds in my breath,
my bellows, my fountain, like 
bright-colored balls in a water spout 
-- hear
me, old matron, justify now this sound 
with your dear old nod of affirmation,
your closed-eye smile and bow of 
recognition, who'll never be fooled 
with the
mere content of words, not my words, 
not these pinfeathered flighters that
stroke your lids till they flutter with 
ecstasy with but the mere echoed noise
of the promise. And after the singing 
and outward marching, you seize my
hand and sing out quavering, "Boy, some 
day you'll make the Founder
proud." Ha! Susie Gresham, Mother 
Gresham, guardian of the hot young
women on the puritan benches who 
couldn't see your Jordan's water for 
their
private steam; you, relic of slavery 
whom the campus loved but did not
understand, aged, of slavery, yet 
bearer of something warm and vital and

all-enduring, of which in that island 
of shame we were not ashamed -- it was
to you on the final row I directed my 
rush of sound, and it was you of
whom I thought with shame and regret as 
I waited for the ceremony to
begin.
The honored guests moved silently upon 
the platform, herded toward
their high, carved chairs by Dr. 
Bledsoe with the decorum of a portly 
head
waiter. Like some of the guests, he 
wore striped trousers and a swallow-tail
coat with black-braided lapels topped 
by a rich ascot tie. It was his regular
dress for such occasions, yet for all 
its elegance, he managed to make himself
look humble. Somehow, his trousers 
inevitably bagged at the knees and the
coat slouched in the shoulders. I 
watched him smiling at first one and 
then
another of the guests, of whom all but 
one were white; and as I saw him
placing his hand upon their arms, 
touching their backs, whispering to a 
tall
angular-faced trustee who in turn 
touched his arm familiarly, I felt a 
shudder.
I too had touched a white man today and 
I felt that it had been disastrous,
and I realized then that he was the 
only one of us whom I knew -- except
perhaps a barber or a nursemaid -- who 
could touch a white man with
impunity. And I remembered too that 
whenever white guests came upon the
platform he placed his hand upon them 
as though exercising a powerful
magic. I watched his teeth flash as he 
took a white hand; then, with all
seated, he went to his place at the end 
of the row of chairs.
Several terraces of students' faces 
above them, the organist, his eyes
glinting at the console, was waiting 
with his head turned over his shoulder,
and I saw Dr. Bledsoe, his eyes roaming 
over the audience, suddenly nod
without turning his head. It was as 
though he had given a downbeat with an
invisible baton. The organist turned 
and hunched his shoulders. A high
cascade of sound bubbled from the 
organ, spreading, thick and clinging, 
over
the chapel, slowly surging. The 
organist twisted and turned on his 
bench,
with his feet flying beneath him as 
though dancing to rhythms totally
unrelated to the decorous thunder of 
his organ.
And Dr. Bledsoe sat with a benign smile 
of inward concentration. Yet
his eyes were darting swiftly, first 
over the rows of students, then over the
section reserved for teachers, his 
swift glance carrying a threat for all. 
For he
demanded that everyone attend these 
sessions. It was here that policy was

announced in broadest rhetoric. I 
seemed to feel his eyes resting upon my
face as he swept the section in which I 
sat. I looked at the guests on the
platform; they sat with that alert 
relaxation with which they always met 
our
upturned eyes. I wondered to which of 
them I might go to intercede for me
with Dr. Bledsoe, but within myself I 
knew that there was no one.
In spite of the array of important men 
beside him, and despite the
posture of humility and meekness which 
made him seem smaller than the
others (although he was physically 
larger), Dr. Bledsoe made his presence 
felt
by us with a far greater impact. I 
remembered the legend of how he had
come to the college, a barefoot boy who 
in his fervor for education had
trudged with his bundle of ragged 
clothing across two states. And how he 
was
given a job feeding slop to the hogs 
but had made himself the best slop
dispenser in the history of the school; 
and how the Founder had been
impressed and made him his office boy. 
Each of us knew of his rise over
years of hard work to the presidency, 
and each of us at some time wished
that he had walked to the school or 
pushed a wheelbarrow or performed
some other act of determination and 
sacrifice to attest his eagerness for
knowledge. I remembered the admiration 
and fear he inspired in everyone on
the campus; the pictures in the Negro 
press captioned "EDUCATOR," in type
that exploded like a rifle shot, his 
face looking out at you with utmost
confidence. To us he was more than just 
a president of a college. He was a
leader, a "statesman" who carried our 
problems to those above us, even unto
the White House; and in days past he 
had conducted the President himself
about the campus. He was our leader and 
our magic, who kept the
endowment high, the funds for 
scholarships plentiful and publicity 
moving
through the channels of the press. He 
was our coal-black daddy of whom we
were afraid.
As the organ voices died, I saw a thin 
brown girl arise noiselessly
with the rigid control of a modern 
dancer, high in the upper rows of the
choir, and begin to sing a cappella. 
She began softly, as though singing to
herself of emotions of utmost privacy, 
a sound not addressed to the gathering,
but which they overheard almost against 
her will. Gradually she increased its
volume, until at times the voice seemed 
to become a disembodied force that
sought to enter her, to violate her, 
shaking her, rocking her rhythmically, 
as
though it had become the source of her 
being, rather than the fluid web of

her own creation.
I saw the guests on the platform turn 
to look behind them, to see
the thin brown girl in white choir robe 
standing high against the organ pipes,
herself become before our eyes a pipe 
of contained, controlled and sublimated
anguish, a thin plain face transformed 
by music. I could not understand the
words, but only the mood, sorrowful, 
vague and ethereal, of the singing. It
throbbed with nostalgia, regret and 
repentance, and I sat with a lump in my
throat as she sank slowly down; not a 
sitting but a controlled collapsing, as
though she were balancing, sustaining 
the simmering bubble of her final tone
by

some

delicate

rhythm

of

her

heart's

blood,

or

by

some

mystic

concentration of her being, focused 
upon the sound through the contained
liquid of her large uplifted eyes.
There was no applause, only the 
appreciation of a profound silence.
The white guests exchanged smiles of 
approval. I sat thinking of the dread
possibility of having to leave all 
this, of being expelled; imagining the 
return
home and the rebukes of my parents. I 
looked out at the scene now from far
back in my despair, seeing the platform 
and its actors as through a reversed
telescope; small doll-like figures 
moving through some meaningless ritual.
Someone up there, above the alternating 
moss-dry and grease-slick heads of
the students rowed before me, was 
making announcements from a lectern on
which a dim light shone. Another figure 
rose and led a prayer. Someone
spoke. Then around me everyone was 
singing Lead me, lead me to a rock
that is higher than I. And as though 
the sound contained some force more
imperious than the image of the scene 
of which it was the living connective
tissue, I was pulled back to its 
immediacy.
One of the guests had risen to speak. A 
man of striking ugliness; fat,
with a bullet-head set on a short neck, 
with a nose much too wide for its
face, upon which he wore black-lensed 
glasses. He had been seated next to
Dr. Bledsoe, but so concerned had I 
been with the president that I hadn't
really seen him. My eyes had focused 
only upon the white men and Dr.
Bledsoe. So that now as he arose and 
crossed slowly to the center of the
platform, I had the notion that part of 
Dr. Bledsoe had arisen and moved
forward, leaving his other part smiling 
in the chair.
He stood before us relaxed, his white 
collar gleaming like a band
between his black face and his dark 
garments, dividing his head from his

body; his short arms crossed before his 
barrel, like a black little Buddha's.
For a moment he stood with his large 
head lifted, as though thinking; then
he began speaking, his voice round and 
vibrant as he told of his pleasure in
being allowed to visit the school once 
more after many years. Having been
preaching in a northern city, he had 
seen it last in the final days of the
Founder, when Dr. Bledsoe was the 
"second in command." "Those were
wonderful days," he droned. 
"Significant days. Days filled with 
great portent."
As he talked he made a cage of his 
hands by touching his fingertips,
then with his small feet pressing 
together, he began a slow, rhythmic 
rocking;
tilting forward on his toes until it 
seemed he would fall, then back on his
heels, the lights catching his 
black-lensed glasses until it seemed 
that his head
floated free of his body and was held 
close to it only by the white band of
his collar. And as he tilted he talked 
until a rhythm was established.
Then he was renewing the dream in our 
hearts:
". . . this barren land after 
Emancipation," he intoned, "this land of
darkness and sorrow, of ignorance and 
degradation, where the hand of
brother had been turned against 
brother, father against son, and son 
against
father; where master had turned against 
slave and slave against master; where
all was strife and darkness, an aching 
land. And into this land came a
humble prophet, lowly like the humble 
carpenter of Nazareth, a slave and a
son of slaves, knowing only his mother. 
A slave born, but marked from the
beginning by a high intelligence and 
princely personality; born in the lowest
part of this barren, war-scarred land, 
yet somehow shedding light upon it
where'er he passed through. I'm sure 
you have heard of his precarious
infancy, his precious life almost 
destroyed by an insane cousin who 
splashed
the babe with lye and shriveled his 
seed and how, a mere babe, he lay nine
days in a deathlike coma and then 
suddenly and miraculously recovered. You
might say that it was as though he had 
risen from the dead or been reborn.
"Oh, my young friends," he cried, 
beaming, "my young friends, it is
indeed a beautiful story. I'm sure 
you've heard it many times: Recall how 
he
came upon his initial learning through 
shrewd questioning of his little
masters, the elder masters never 
suspecting; and how he learned his 
alphabet
and taught himself to read and solve 
the secret of words, going instinctively
to the Holy Bible with its great wisdom 
for his first knowledge. And you
know how he escaped and made his way 
across mountain and valley to that

place of learning and how he persisted 
and worked noontimes, nights and
mornings for the privilege of studying, 
or, as the old folk would say, of
'rubbing his head against the college 
wall.' You know of his brilliant career,
how already he was a moving orator; 
then his penniless graduation and his
return after years to this country.
"And then his great struggle beginning. 
Picture it, my young friends:
The clouds of darkness all over the 
land, black folk and white folk full of
fear and hate, wanting to go forward, 
but each fearful of the other. A whole
region is caught in a terrible tension. 
Everyone is perplexed with the question
of what must be done to dissolve this 
fear and hatred that crouched over the
land like a demon waiting to spring, 
and you know how he came and showed
them the way. Oh, yes, my friends. I'm 
sure you've heard it time and time
again; of this godly man's labors, his 
great humility and his undimming
vision, the fruits of which you enjoy 
today; concrete, made flesh; his dream,
conceived in the starkness and darkness 
of slavery, fulfilled now even in the
air you breathe, in the sweet harmonies 
of your blended voices, in the
knowledge which each of you -- 
daughters and granddaughters, sons and
grandsons, of slaves -- all of you 
partaking of it in bright and 
well-equipped
classrooms. You must see this slave, 
this black Aristotle, moving slowly, 
with
sweet patience, with a patience not of 
mere man, but of God-inspired faith 
-see him moving slowly as he surmounts 
each and every opposition. Rendering
unto Caesar that which was Caesar's, 
yes; but steadfastly seeking for you 
that
bright horizon which you now enjoy . . .
"All this," he said, spreading his 
fingers palm down before him, "has
been told and retold throughout the 
land, inspiring a humble but fast-rising
people. You have heard it, and it -- 
this true story of rich implication, 
this
living parable of proven glory and 
humble nobility -- and it, as I say, has
made you free. Even you who have come 
to this shrine only this semester
know it. You have heard his name from 
your parents, for it was he who led
them to the path, guiding them like a 
great captain; like that great pilot of
ancient times who led his people safe 
and unharmed across the bottom of the
blood-red sea. And your parents 
followed this remarkable man across the
black sea of prejudice, safely out of 
the land of ignorance, through the 
storms
of fear and anger, shouting, LET MY 
PEOPLE GO! when it was necessary,
whispering it during those times when 
whispering was wisest. And he was

heard."
I

listened,

my

back

pressing

against

the

hard

bench,

with

a

numbness, my emotions woven into his 
words as upon a loom.
"And remember how," he said, "when he 
entered a certain state at
cotton-picking time, his enemies had 
plotted to take his life. And recall how
during his journey he was stopped by 
the strange figure of a man whose
pitted features revealed no inkling of 
whether he was black or white . . .
Some say he was a Greek. Some a 
Mongolian. Others a mulatto -- and 
others
still, a simple white man of God. 
Whoever, and whatsoever, and we must not
rule out the possibility of an emissary 
direct from above -- oh, yes! -- and
remember how he appeared suddenly, 
startling both Founder and horse as he
gave warning, telling the Founder to 
leave the horse and buggy there in the
road and proceed immediately to a 
certain cabin, then slipped silently 
away,
so silently, my young friends, that the 
Founder doubted his very existence.
And you know how the great man 
continued through the dusk, determined
though puzzled as he approached the 
town. He was lost, lost in reverie until
the crack of the first rifle sounded, 
then the almost fatal volley that 
creased
his skull -- oh my! -- and left him 
stunned and apparently lifeless.
"I have heard him tell with his own 
lips how consciousness returned
while they were still upon him 
examining their foul deed, and how he 
lay
biting his heart lest they hear it and 
wipe out their failure with a
coup-de-grace, as the French would say. 
Ha! And I'm sure you've each of you
lived with him through his escape," he 
said, seeming to look directly into my
watered eyes. "You awakened when he 
awakened, rejoiced when he rejoiced at
their leaving without further harm; 
arising when he arose; seeing with his
eyes the prints of their milling 
footsteps and the cartridges dropped in 
the
dust about the imprint of his fallen 
body; yes, and the cold, dust-encrusted,
but not quite fatal blood. And you 
hurried with him full of doubt to the
cabin designated by the stranger, where 
he met that seemingly demented
black man . . . You remember that old 
one, laughed at by the children in the
town's square, old, comic-faced, 
crafty, cotton-headed. And yet it was 
he who
bound up your wounds with the wounds of 
the Founder. He, the old slave,
showing a surprising knowledge of such 
matters -- germology and scabology -ha! 
ha! -- he called it, and what a 
youthful skill of the hands! For he 
shaved
our skull, and cleansed our wound and 
bound it neat with bandages stolen

from the home of an unsuspecting leader 
of the mob, ha! And you recall how
you plunged with the Founder, the 
Leader, deep into the black art of 
escape,
guided at first, indeed, initiated, by 
the seemingly demented one who had
learned his craft in slavery. You left 
with the Founder in the black of night,
and I know it. You hurried silently 
along the river bottom, stung by
mosquitoes, hooted by owls, zoomed by 
bats, buzzed by snakes that rattled
among the rocks, mud and fever, 
darkness and sighing. You hid all the
following day in the cabin where 
thirteen slept in three small rooms, 
standing
until darkness in the fireplace 
chimney, back in all the soot and ashes 
-- ha!
ha! -- guarded by the granny who dozed 
at the hearth seemingly without a
fire. You stood in the blackness and 
when they came with their baying
hounds they thought her demented. But 
she knew, she knew! She knew the
fire! She knew the fire! She knew the 
fire that burned without consuming!
My God, yes!"
"My God, yes!" a woman's voice 
responded, adding to the structure
of his vision within me.
"And you left with him in the morning, 
hidden in a wagonload of
cotton, in the very center of the 
fleece, where you breathed the hot air
through the barrel of the emergency 
shotgun; the cartridges, which thank God
it was unnecessary to use, held fanwise 
and ready between the spread fingers
of your hand. And you went into this 
town with him and were hidden by the
friendly aristocrat one night, and on 
the next by the white blacksmith who
held no hatred -- surprising 
contradictions of the underground. 
Escaping, yes!
helped by those who knew you and those 
who didn't know. Because for some
it was enough to see him; others helped 
without even that, black and white.
But mostly it was our own who aided, 
because you were their own and we
have always helped our own. And so, my 
young friends, my sisters and
brothers, you went with him, in and out 
of cabins, by night and early
morning, through swamps and hills. On 
and on, passed from black hand to
black hand and some white hands, and 
all the hands molding the Founder's
freedom and our own freedom like voices 
shaping a deep-felt song. And you,
each of you, were with him. Ah, how 
well you know it, for it was you who
escaped to freedom. Ah, yes, and you 
know the story."
I saw him resting now, and beaming out 
across the chapel, his huge
head turning to all its corners like a 
beacon, his voice still echoing as I

fought back my emotion. For the first 
time the evocation of the Founder
saddened me, and the campus seemed to 
rush past me, fast retreating, like
the fading of a dream at the sundering 
of slumber. Beside me, the student's
eyes swam with a distorting cataract of 
tears, his features rigid as though he
struggled within himself. The fat man 
was playing upon the whole audience
without the least show of exertion. He 
seemed completely composed, hidden
behind his black-lensed glasses, only 
his mobile features gesturing his vocal
drama. I nudged the boy beside me.
"Who is he?" I whispered.
He gave me a look of annoyance, almost 
of outrage. "Reverend
Homer A. Barbee, Chicago," he said.
Now the speaker rested his arm upon the 
lectern and turned toward
Dr. Bledsoe:
"You've heard the bright beginning of 
the beautiful story, my friends.
But there is the mournful ending, and 
perhaps in many ways the richer side.
The setting of this glorious son of the 
morning."
He turned to Dr. Bledsoe, "It was a 
fateful day, Dr. Bledsoe, sir, if I
may recall it to you, for we were 
there. Oh yes, my young friends," he 
said,
turning to face us again with a sad 
proud smile. "I knew him well and loved
him, and I was there.
"We had toured through several states 
to which he was carrying the
message. The people had come to hear 
the prophet, the multitude had
responded. The old-fashioned people; 
women in aprons and Mother Hubbards
of calico and gingham, men in their 
overalls and patched alpacas; a sea of
upturned and puzzled faces looking out 
from beneath old battered straw hats
and limp sunbonnets. They who had come 
by oxen and mule team and by
walking long distances. It was the 
month of September and unseasonably
cold. He had spoken peace and 
confidence into their troubled souls, 
had set a
star before them and we were passing on 
to other scenes, still carrying the
message.
"Ah, those days of ceaseless travel, 
those youthful days, those
springtime days; fertile, blossomy, 
sun-filled days of promise. Ah, yes, 
those
indescribably glorious days, in which 
the Founder was building the dream not
only here in this then barren valley, 
but hither and yonder throughout the
land, instilling the dream in the 
hearts of the people. Erecting the 
scaffolding

of a nation. Broadcasting his message 
that fell like seed on tallow ground,
sacrificing himself, fighting and 
forgiving his enemies of both 
complexions-oh
yes, he had them, of both complexions. 
But going forward filled with the
importance of his message, filled with 
his dedicated mission; and in his zeal,
perhaps in his mortal pride, ignoring 
the advice of his physician. I see in my
mind's eye the fatal atmosphere of that 
jam-packed auditorium: The Founder
holds the audience within the gentle 
palm of his eloquence, rocking it,
soothing it, instructing it; and there 
below, the rapt faces blushed by the 
glow
of the big pot-bellied stove now turned 
cherry-red with its glowing; yes, the
spellbound rows caught in the imperious 
truth of his message. And I hear
now, again, the great humming hush as 
his voice reached the end of a
mighty period, and one of the 
listeners, a snowy-headed man, leaps to 
his
feet crying out, 'Tell us what is to be 
done, sir! For God's sake, tell us! Tell
us in the name of the son they snatched 
from me last week!' And all through
the room the voices arising, imploring, 
'Tell us, tell us!' And the Founder is
suddenly mute with tears."
Old Barbee's voice rang out, as 
suddenly he made charged and
incomplete movements about the 
platform, acting out his words. And I
watched with a sick fascination, 
knowing part of the story, yet a part 
of me
fighting against its sad inevitable 
conclusion.
"And the Founder pauses, then steps 
forward with his eyes spilling
his great emotion. With his arm 
upraised, he begins to answer and 
totters.
Then all is commotion. We rush forward 
and lead him away.
"The audience leaps to its feet in 
consternation. All is terror and
turmoil, a moan and a sighing. Until, 
like a clap of thunder, I hear Dr.
Bledsoe's voice ring out whip-like with 
authority, a song of hope. And as we
stretch the Founder upon a bench to 
rest, I hear Dr. Bledsoe stomping out
the time with mighty strokes upon the 
hollow platform, commanding not in
words but in the great gut-tones of his 
magnificent basso -- oh, but wasn't he
a singer? Isn't he a singer still 
today? -- and they stand, they calm, 
and with
him they sing out against the tottering 
of their giant. Sing out their long
black songs of blood and bones:
"Meaning HOPE!
"Of hardship and pain:
"Meaning FAITH!

"Of humbleness and absurdity:
"Meaning ENDURANCE!
"Of ceaseless struggle in darkness, 
meaning:
"TRIUMPH . . .
"Ha!" Barbee cried, slapping his hands, 
"Ha! Singing verse after
verse, until the leader revived!" 
(Slap, slap of his hands.)
"Addressed them" -(Slap!) "My God, my 
God!
"Assured them" -- (Slap!)
"That" -- (Slap!)
"He was only tired of his ceaseless 
efforts." (Slap!) "Yes, and
dismisses them, sending each on his way 
rejoicing, giving each a parting
handshake of fellowship . . ."
I watched Barbee pace in a semicircle, 
his lips compressed, his face
working with emotion, his palms meeting 
but making no sound.
"Ah, those days in which he tilled his 
mighty fields, those days in
which he watched the crops take hold 
and grow, those youthful, summery,
sun-bright days . . ."
Barbee's voice sighed off in nostalgia. 
The chapel hardly breathed as
he sighed deeply. Then I watched him 
produce a snowy handkerchief, remove
his dark glasses and wipe his eyes, and 
through the increasing distance of my
isolation, I watched the men in the 
seats of honor slowly shake their
spellbound heads. Then Barbee's voice 
began again, disembodied now, and it
was as though he had never paused, as 
though his words, reverberating
within us, had continued their rhythmic 
flow though their source was for a
moment stilled:
"Oh, yes, my young friends, oh, yes," 
he continued with a great
sadness. "Man's hope can paint a purple 
picture, can transform a soaring
vulture into a noble eagle or a moaning 
dove. Oh, yes! But I knew," he
shouted, startling me. "In spite of 
that great, anguished hope within me, I
knew -- knew that the great spirit was 
declining, was approaching its lonely
winter; the great sun going down. For 
sometimes it is given one to know
these things . . . And I staggered 
under the awful burden of that knowledge
and I cursed myself because I bore it. 
But such was the Founder's enthusiasm
-- oh, yes! -- that as we sped from 
country town to country town through the

glorious Indian summer, I soon forgot. 
And then . . . And then . . . and . . .
then . . ."
I listened to his voice fall to a 
whisper; his hands were outspread as
though he were leading an orchestra 
into a profound and final diminuendo.
Then his voice rose again, crisply, 
almost matter-of-factly, accelerated:
"I remember the start of the train, how 
it seemed to groan as it
started up the steep grade into the 
mountain. It was cold. Frost formed its
icy patterns upon the window's edges. 
And the whistle of the train was
long-drawn and lonely, a sigh issuing 
from the depths of the mountain.
"In the car up ahead, in the Pullman 
assigned him by the very
president of the line, the Leader lay 
tossing. He had been struck with a
sudden and mysterious sickness. And I 
knew in spite of the anguish within
me that the sun goeth down, for the 
heavens themselves conveyed that
knowledge. The rush of the train, the 
clicking of wheels upon the steel. I
remember how I looked out of the 
frosted pane and saw the looming great
North Star and lost it, as though the 
sky had shut its eye. The train was
curving the mountain, the engine loping 
like a great black hound, parallel
with the last careening cars, panting 
forth its pale white vapor as it hurled 
us
ever higher. And shortly the sky was 
black, without a moon . . ."
As his "mooo-o-on" echoed over the 
chapel, he drew his chin against
his chest until his white collar 
disappeared, leaving him a figure of 
balanced
unbroken blackness, and I could hear 
the rasp of air as he inhaled.
"It was as though the very 
constellations knew our impending
sorrow," he bugled, his head raised to 
the ceiling, his voice full-throated. 
"For
against that great -- wide -- sweep of 
sable there came the burst of a single
jewel-like star, and I saw it shimmer, 
and break, and streak down the cheek
of that coal-black sky like a reluctant 
and solitary tear . . ."
He shook his head with great emotion, 
his lips pursed as he moaned,
"Mmmmmmmmmm," turning toward Dr. 
Bledsoe as though he did not quite
see him. "At that fateful moment . . . 
Mmmmmm, I sat with your great
president . . . Mmmmmmmmmm! He was deep 
in meditation as we awaited
word from the men of science, and he 
said to me of that dying star,
" 'Barbee, friend, did you see?'
"And I answered, 'Yes, Doctor, I saw.'
"And at our throats already we felt the 
cold hands of sorrow. And I

said to Dr. Bledsoe, 'Let us pray.' And 
as we knelt there on the swaying floor
our words were less prayers than sounds 
of mute and terrible sorrow. And it
was then, as we pulled to our feet, 
staggering with the motion of that
speeding train, that we saw the 
physician moving toward us. And we 
looked
with bated breath into the blank and 
expressionless features of the man of
science, asking with our total beings: 
Do you bring us hope or disaster? And
it was then and there he informed us 
that the Leader was nearing his
destination . . .
"It was said, the cruel blow had fallen 
and we were left numb, but
the Founder was still for the moment 
with us and still in command. And, of
all in the traveling party, he sent for 
him who sits there before you, and for
me as a man of God. But he wanted 
mainly his friend of midnight
consultations, his comrade of many 
battles, who over the weary years had
remained steadfast in defeat as in 
victory.
"Even now I can see it, the dark 
passage lit with dim lights and Dr.
Bledsoe swaying as he went before me. 
At the door stood the porter and the
conductor, a black man and a white man 
of the South, both crying. Both
weeping. And he looked up as we 
entered, his great eyes resigned but 
still
aflame with nobility and courage 
against the white of his pillow; and he
looked at his friend and smiled. Smiled 
warmly at his old campaigner, his
loyal champion, his adjunct, that 
marvelous singer of the old songs who 
had
rallied his spirit during times of 
distress and discouragement, who with 
his
singing of the old familiar melodies 
soothed the doubts and fears of the
multitude; he who had rallied the 
ignorant, the fearful and suspicious, 
those
still wrapped in the rags of slavery; 
him, there, your leader, who calmed the
children of the storm. And as the 
Founder looked up at his companion, he
smiled. And reaching out his hand to 
his friend and companion as I now
stretch out my hand to you, he said, 
'Come closer. Come closer.' And he
moved closer, until he stood beside the 
berth, and the light slanting across
his shoulder as he knelt beside him. 
And the hand reached out and gently
touched him and he said, 'Now, you must 
take on the burden. Lead them the
rest of the way.' And oh, the cry of 
that train and the pain too big for 
tears!
"When the train reached the summit of 
the mountain, he was no
longer with us. And as the train 
dropped down the grade he had departed.
"It had become a veritable train of 
sorrow. Dr. Bledsoe there, sat

weary in mind and heavy of heart. What 
should he do? The Leader was dead
and he thrown suddenly at the head of 
the troops like a cavalryman
catapulted into the saddle of his 
general felled in a charge of 
battle-vaulted
onto the back of his fiery and 
half-broken charger. Ah! And that 
great, black,
noble beast, wall-eyed with the din of 
battle and twitching already with its
sense of loss. What command should he 
give? Should he return with his
burden, home, to where already the hot 
wires were flashing, speaking, rattling
the mournful message? Should he turn 
and bear the fallen soldier down the
cold and alien mountain to this valley 
home? Return with the dear eyes
dulled, the firm hand still, the 
magnificent voice silent, the Leader 
cold?
Return to the warm valley, to the green 
grounds he could no longer light
with his mortal vision? Should he 
follow his Leader's vision though he had
now himself departed?
"Ah, of course you know the story: How 
he bore the body into the
strange city, and the speech he made as 
his Leader lay in state, and how
when the sad news spread, a day of 
mourning was declared for the whole
municipality. Oh, and how rich and 
poor, black and white, weak and
powerful, young and old, all came to 
pay their homage-many realizing the
Leader's worth and their loss only now 
with his passing. And how, with his
mission done, Dr. Bledsoe returned, 
keeping his sorrowful vigil with his 
friend
in an humble baggage car; and how the 
people came to pay their respects at
the stations . . . A slow train. A 
sorrowful train. And all along the 
line, in
mountain and valley, wherever the rails 
found their fateful course, the people
were one in their common mourning, and 
like the cold steel rails, were
spiked down to their sorrow. Oh, what a 
sad departure!
"And what an even sadder arrival. See 
with me, my young friends,
hear with me: The weeping and wailing 
of those who shared his labors. Their
sweet Leader returned to them, 
rock-cold in the iron immobility of 
death. He
who had left them quick, in the prime 
of his manhood, author of their own
fire and illumination, returned to them 
cold, already a bronzed statue. Oh,
the despair, my young friends. The 
black despair of black people! I see 
them
now; wandering about these grounds, 
where each brick, each bird, each blade
of grass was a reminder of some 
precious memory; and each memory a
hammer stroke driving home the blunt 
spikes of their sorrow. Oh, yes, some
now are here gray-haired among you, 
still dedicated to his vision, still

laboring in the vineyard. But then with 
the black-draped coffin lying in state
among them -- inescapably reminding 
them -- they felt the dark night of
slavery settling once more upon them. 
They smelt that old obscene stink of
darkness, that old slavery smell, worse 
than the rank halitosis of hoary death.
Their sweet light enclosed in a 
black-draped coffin, their majestic sun
snatched behind a cloud.
"Oh, and the sad sound of weeping 
bugles! I can hear them now,
stationed at the four corners of the 
campus, sounding taps for the fallen
general; announcing and re-announcing 
the sad tidings, telling and retelling
the sad revelation one to the other 
across the still numbness of the air, as
though they could not believe it, could 
neither comprehend nor accept it;
bugles weeping like a family of tender 
women lamenting their loved one. And
the people came to sing the old songs 
and to express their unspeakable
sorrow. Black, black, black! Black 
people in blacker mourning, the funeral
crape hung upon their naked hearts; 
singing unashamedly their black folk's
songs of sorrow, moving painfully, 
overflowing the curving walks, weeping 
and
wailing beneath the drooping trees and 
their low murmuring voices like the
moans of winds in a wilderness. And 
finally they gathered on the hill slope
and as far as the tear-wet eyes could 
see, they stood with their heads bowed,
singing.
"Then silence. The lonesome hole banked 
with poignant flowers. The
dozen white-gloved hands waiting taut 
upon the silken ropes. That awful
silence. The final words are spoken. A 
single wild rose tossed farewell, bursts
slowly, its petals drifting snowlike 
upon the reluctantly lowered coffin. 
Then
down into the earth; back to the 
ancient dust; back to the cold black 
clay . .
. mother . . . of us all."
As Barbee paused the silence was so 
complete that I could hear the
power engines far across the campus 
throbbing the night like an excited
pulse. Somewhere in the audience an old 
woman's voice began a plaintive
wail; the birth of a sad, untormulated 
song that died stillborn in a sob.
Barbee stood with his head thrown back, 
his arms rigid at his sides,
his fists clenched as though fighting 
desperately for control. Dr. Bledsoe sat
with his face in his hands. Near me 
someone blew his nose. Barbee took a
tottering step forward.
"Oh, yes. Oh, yes," he said. "Oh, yes. 
That too is part of the glorious

story. But think of it not as a death, 
but as a birth. A great seed had been
planted. A seed which has continued to 
put forth its fruit in its season as
surely as if the great creator had been 
resurrected. For in a sense he was, if
not in the flesh, in the spirit. And in 
a sense in the flesh too. For has not
your present leader become his living 
agent, his physical presence? Look
about you if you doubt it. My young 
friends, my dear young friends! How
can I tell you what manner of man this 
is who leads you? How can I convey
to you how well he has kept his pledge 
to the Founder, how conscientious
has been his stewardship?
"First, you must see the school as it 
was. Already a great institution,
to be sure; but then the buildings were 
eight, now they are twenty; then the
faculty was fifty, now it is two 
hundred; then the student body was a few
hundred, where now I'm told you are 
three thousand. And now where you
have roads of asphalt for the passage 
of rubber tires, then the roads were of
crushed stone for the passage of oxen, 
and mule teams, and horse-drawn
wagons. I have not the words to tell 
you how my heart swelled to return to
this great institution after so great a 
while to move among its wealth of green
things, its fruitful farmland and 
fragrant campus. Ah! and the marvelous 
plant
supplying power to an area larger than 
many towns -- all operated by black
hands. Thus, my young friends, does the 
light of the Founder still burn. Your
leader has kept his promise a 
thousandfold. I commend him in his own 
right,
for he is the co-architect of a great 
and noble experiment. He is a worthy
successor to his great friend and it is 
no accident that his great and
intelligent leadership has made him our 
leading statesman. This is a form of
greatness worthy of your imitation. I 
say to you, pattern yourselves upon him.
Aspire, each of you, to some day follow 
in his footsteps. Great deeds are yet
to be performed. For we are a young, 
though a fast-rising, people. Legends
are still to be created. Be not afraid 
to undertake the burdens of your leader,
and the work of the Founder will be one 
of ever unfolding glory, the history
of the race a saga of mounting 
triumphs."
Barbee stood with his arms outstretched 
now, beaming over the
audience, his Buddha-like body still as 
an onyx boulder. There was sniffling
throughout the chapel. Voices murmured 
with admiration and I felt more lost
than ever. For a few minutes old Barbee 
had made me see the vision and
now I knew that leaving the campus 
would be like the parting of flesh. I

watched him lower his arms now and 
start back to his chair, moving slowly
with his head cocked as though 
listening to distant music. I had 
lowered my
head to wipe my eyes when I heard the 
shocked gasp arise.
Looking up, I saw two of the white 
trustees moving swiftly across the
platform to where Barbee floundered 
upon Dr. Bledsoe's legs. The old man
slid forward upon his hands and knees 
as the two white men took his arms;
and now as he stood I saw one of them 
reach for something on the floor
and place it in his hands. It was when 
he raised his head that I saw it. For
a swift instant, between the gesture 
and the opaque glitter of his glasses, I
saw the blinking of sightless eyes. 
Homer A. Barbee was blind.
Uttering apologies, Dr. Bledsoe helped 
him to his chair. Then as the
old man rested back with a smile, Dr. 
Bledsoe walked to the edge of the
platform and lifted his arms. I closed 
my eyes as I heard the deep moaning
sound that issued from him, and the 
rising crescendo of the student body
joining in. This time it was music 
sincerely felt, not rendered for the 
guests,
but for themselves; a song of hope and 
exaltation. I wanted to rush from the
building, but didn't dare. I sat stiff 
and erect, supported by the hard bench,
relying upon it as upon a form of hope.
I could not look at Dr. Bledsoe now, 
because old Barbee had made
me both feel my guilt and accept it. 
For although I had not intended it, any
act that endangered the continuity of 
the dream was an act of treason.
I did not listen to the next speaker, a 
tall white man who kept
dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief 
and repeating his phrases in an
emotional and inarticulate manner. Then 
the orchestra played excerpts from
Dvorak's New World Symphony and I kept 
hearing "Swing Low Sweet
Chariot"

resounding

through

its

dominant

theme

--

my

mother's

and

grandfather's favorite spiritual. It 
was more than I could stand, and before 
the
next speaker could begin I hurried past 
the disapproving eyes of teachers and
matrons, out into the night.
A mockingbird trilled a note from where 
it perched upon the hand of
the moonlit Founder, flipping its 
moon-mad tail above the head of the
eternally kneeling slave. I went up the 
shadowy drive, heard it trill behind
me. The street lamps glowed brilliant 
in the moonlit dream of the campus,
each light serene in its cage of 
shadows.
I might well have waited until the end 
of the services, for I hadn't

gone far when I heard the dim, bright 
notes of the orchestra striking up a
march, followed by a burst of voices as 
the students filed out into the night.
With a feeling of dread I headed for 
the administration building, and upon
reaching it, stood in the darkened 
doorway. My mind fluttered like the 
moths
that veiled the street lamp which cast 
shadows upon the bank of grass below
me. I would now have my real interview 
with Dr. Bledsoe, and I recalled
Barbee's address with resentment. With 
such words fresh in his mind, I was
sure Dr. Bledsoe would be far less 
sympathetic to my plea. I stood in that
darkened doorway trying to probe my 
future if I were expelled. Where would
I go, what would I do? How could I ever 
return home?

Chapter 6
Down the sloping lawn below me the male 
students moved toward
their dormitories, seeming far away 
from me now, remote, and each shadowy
form vastly superior to me, who had by 
some shortcoming cast myself into
the darkness away from all that was 
worthwhile and inspiring. I listened to
one group harmonize quietly as they 
passed. The smell of fresh bread being
prepared in the bakery drifted to me. 
The good white bread of breakfast; the
rolls dripping with yellow butter that 
I had slipped into my pocket so often
to be munched later in my room with 
wild blackberry jam from home.
Lights began to appear in the girls' 
dormitories, like the bursting of
luminous seeds flung broadside by an 
invisible hand. Several cars rolled by. 
I
saw a group of old women who lived in 
the town approaching. One used a
cane which from time to time she tapped 
hollowly upon the walk like a blind
man. Snatches of their conversation 
fluttered to me as they discussed 
Barbee's
talk with enthusiasm, recalled the 
times of the Founder, their quavering 
voices
weaving and embroidering his story. 
Then down the long avenue of trees I
saw the familiar Cadillac

approaching and

started

inside the building,

suddenly filled with panic. I hadn't 
gone two steps before I turned and
hurried out into the night again. I 
couldn't stand to face Dr. Bledsoe

immediately. I was fairly shivering as 
I fell in behind a group of boys going
up the drive. They were arguing some 
point heatedly, but I was too agitated
to listen and simply followed in their 
shadows, noticing the dull gleam of
their polished shoe-leather in the rays 
of the street lamps. I kept trying to
formulate what I would say to Dr. 
Bledsoe, and the boys must have turned
into their building, for suddenly 
finding myself outside the gates of the
campus and heading down the highway, I 
turned and ran back to the
building.
When I went in he was wiping his neck 
with a blue-bordered
handkerchief. The shaded lamp catching 
the lenses of his glasses left half of
his broad face in shadow as his 
clenched fists stretched full forth in 
the light
before him. I stood, hesitating in the 
door, aware suddenly of the old heavy
furnishings, the relics from the times 
of the Founder, the framed portrait
photographs and relief plaques of 
presidents and industrialists, men of
power-fixed like trophies or heraldic 
emblems upon the walls.
"Come in," he said from the 
half-shadow; then I saw him move and
his head coming forward, his eyes 
burning.
He began mildly, as if quietly joking, 
throwing me off balance.
"Boy," he said, "I understand that you 
not only carried Mr. Norton
out to the Quarters but that you wound 
up at that sinkhole, that Golden
Day."
It was a statement, not a question. I 
said nothing and he looked at
me with the same mild gaze. Had Barbee 
helped Mr. Norton soften him?
"No," he said, "it wasn't enough to 
take him to the Quarters, you
had to make the complete tour, to give 
him the full treatment. Was that it?"
"No, sir . . . I mean that he was ill, 
sir," I said. "He had to have
some whiskey . . ."
"And that was the only place you knew 
to go," he said. "So you went
there because you were taking care of 
him . . ."
"Yes, sir . . ."
"And not only that," he said in a voice 
that both mocked and
marveled, "you took him out and sat him 
down on the gallery, veranda -piazza -- 
whatever they call it now'days -- and 
introduced him to the quality!"
"Quality?" I frowned. "Oh -- but he 
insisted that I stop, sir. There
was nothing I could do . . ."

"Of course," he said. "Of course."
"He was interested in the cabins, sir. 
He was surprised that there
were any left."
"So naturally you stopped," he said, 
bowing his head again.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, and I suppose the cabin opened up 
and told him its life history
and all the choice gossip?"
I started to explain.
"Boy!" he exploded. "Are you serious? 
Why were you out on that
road in the first place? Weren't you 
behind the wheel?"
"Yes, sir . . ."
"Then haven't we bowed and scraped and 
begged and lied enough
decent homes and drives for you to show 
him? Did you think that white man
had to come a thousand miles -- all the 
way from New York and Boston and
Philadelphia just for you to show him a 
slum? Don't just stand there, say
something!"
"But I was only driving him, sir. I 
only stopped there after he
ordered me to . . ."
"Ordered you?" he said. "He ordered 
you. Dammit, white folk are
always giving orders, it's a habit with 
them. Why didn't you make an excuse?
Couldn't you say they had sickness -- 
smallpox -- or picked another cabin?
Why that Trueblood shack? My God, boy! 
You're black and living in the
South -- did you forget how to lie?"
"Lie, sir? Lie to him, lie to a 
trustee, sir? Me?"
He shook his head with a kind of 
anguish. "And me thinking I'd
picked a boy with brain," he said. 
"Didn't you know you were endangering
the school?"
"But I was only trying to please him . 
. ."
"Please him? And here you are a junior 
in college! Why, the dumbest
black bastard in the cotton patch knows 
that the only way to please a white
man is to tell him a lie! What kind of 
education are you getting around
here? Who really told you to take him 
out there?" he said.
"He did, sir. No one else."
"Don't lie to me!"
"That's the truth, sir."

"I warn you now, who suggested it?"
"I swear, sir. No one told me."
"Nigger, this isn't the time to lie. 
I'm no white man. Tell me the
truth!"
It was as though he'd struck me. I 
stared across the desk thinking,
He called me that . . .
"Answer me, boy!"
That, I thought, noticing the throbbing 
of a vein that rose between
his eyes, thinking, He called me that.
"I wouldn't lie, sir," I said.
"Then who was that patient you were 
talking with?"
"I never saw him before, sir."
"What was he saying?"
"I can't recall it all," I muttered. 
"The man was raving."
"Speak up. What did he say?"
"He thinks that he lived in France and 
that he's a great doctor . . ."
"Continue."
"He said that I believed that white was 
right," I said.
"What?" Suddenly his face twitched and 
cracked like the surface of
dark water. "And you do, don't you?" 
Dr. Bledsoe said, suppressing a nasty
laugh. "Well, don't you?"
I did not answer, thinking, You, you . 
. .
"Who was he, did you ever see him 
before?"
"No, sir, I hadn't."
"Was he northern or southern?"
"I don't know, sir."
He struck his desk. "College for 
Negroes! Boy, what do you know
other than how to ruin an institution 
in half an hour that it took over half a
hundred years to build? Did he talk 
northern or southern?"
"He talked like a white man," I said, 
"except that his voice sounded
southern, like one of ours . . ."
"I'll have to investigate him," he 
said. "A Negro like that should be
under lock and key."
Across the campus a clock struck the 
quarter hour and something
inside me seemed to muffle its sound. I 
turned to him desperately. "Dr.

Bledsoe, I'm awfully sorry. I had no 
intention of going there but things just
got out of hand. Mr. Norton understands 
how it happened . . ."
"Listen to me, boy," he said loudly. 
"Norton is one man and I'm
another, and while he might think he's 
satisfied, I know that he isn't! Your
poor judgment has caused this school 
incalculable damage. Instead of 
uplifting
the race, you've torn it down."
He looked at me as though I had 
committed the worst crime
imaginable. "Don't you know we can't 
tolerate such a thing? I gave you an
opportunity to serve one of our best 
white friends, a man who could make
your fortune. But in return you dragged 
the entire race into the slime!"
Suddenly he reached for something 
beneath a pile of papers, an old leg
shackle from slavery which he proudly 
called a "symbol of our progress."
"You've got to be disciplined, boy," he 
said. "There's no ifs and ands
about it."
"But you gave Mr. Norton your word . . 
."
"Don't stand there and tell me what I 
already know. Regardless of
what I said, as the leader of this 
institution I can't possibly let this 
pass. Boy,
I'm getting rid of you!" It must have 
happened when the metal struck the
desk, for suddenly I was leaning toward 
him, shouting with outrage.
"I'll tell him," I said. "I'll go to 
Mr. Norton and tell him. You've lied
to both of us . . ."
"What!" he said. "You have the nerve to 
threaten me . . . in my own
office?"
"I'll tell him," I screamed. "I'll tell 
everybody. I'll fight you. I swear
it, I'll fight!"
"Well," he said, sitting back, "well, 
I'll be damned!" For a moment he
looked me up and down and I saw his 
head go back into the shadow,
hearing a high, thin sound like a cry 
of rage; then his face came forward and
I saw his laughter. For an instant I 
stared; then I wheeled and started for
the door, hearing him sputter, "Wait, 
wait," behind me.
I turned. He gasped for breath, 
propping his huge head up with his
hands as tears streamed down his face.
"Come on, come," he said, removing his 
glasses and wiping his eyes.
"Come on, son," his voice amused and 
conciliatory. It was as though I were
being put through a fraternity 
initiation and found myself going back. 
He

looked at me, still laughing with 
agony. My eyes burned.
"Boy, you are a fool," he said. "Your 
white folk didn't teach you
anything and your mother-wit has left 
you cold. What has happened to you
young Negroes? I thought you had caught 
on to how things are done down
here. But you don't even know the 
difference between the way things are 
and
the way they're supposed to be. My 
God," he gasped, "what is the race
coming to? Why, boy, you can tell 
anyone you like -- sit down there . . . 
Sit
down, sir, I say!"
Reluctantly I sat, torn between anger 
and fascination, hating myself
for obeying.
"Tell anyone you like," he said. "I 
don't care. I wouldn't raise my
little finger to stop you. Because I 
don't owe anyone a thing, son. Who,
Negroes? Negroes don't control this 
school or much of anything else 
-haven't you learned even that? No, 
sir, they don't control this school, nor
white folk either. True they support 
it, but I control it. I's big and black 
and
I say 'Yes, suh' as loudly as any 
burr-head when it's convenient, but I'm 
still
the king down here. I don't care how 
much it appears otherwise. Power
doesn't have to show off. Power is 
confident, self-assuring, self-starting 
and
self-stopping, self-warming and 
self-justifying. When you have it, you 
know it.
Let the Negroes snicker and the 
crackers laugh! Those are the facts, 
son. The
only ones I even pretend to please are 
big white folk, and even those I
control more than they control me. This 
is a power set-up, son, and I'm at
the controls. You think about that. 
When you buck against me, you're bucking
against power, rich white folk's power, 
the nation's power -- which means
government power!"
He paused to let it sink in and I 
waited, feeling a numb, violent
outrage.
"And I'll tell you something your 
sociology teachers are afraid to tell
you," he said. "If there weren't men 
like me running schools like this, 
there'd
be no South. Nor North, either. No, and 
there'd be no country -- not as it is
today. You think about that, son." He 
laughed. "With all your speechmaking
and studying I thought you understood 
something. But you . . . All right, go
ahead. See Norton. You'll find that he 
wants you disciplined; he might not
know it, but he does. Because he knows 
that I know what is best for his
interests. You're a black educated 
fool, son. These white folk have 
newspapers,

magazines, radios, spokesmen to get 
their ideas across. If they want to tell
the world a lie, they can tell it so 
well that it becomes the truth; and if 
I tell
them that you're lying, they'll tell 
the world even if you prove you're 
telling
the truth. Because it's the kind of lie 
they want to hear . . ."
I heard the high thin laugh again. 
"You're nobody, son. You don't
exist -- can't you see that? The white 
folk tell everybody what to think 
-except men like me. I tell them; 
that's my life, telling white folk how 
to think
about the things I know about. Shocks 
you, doesn't it? Well, that's the way it
is. It's a nasty deal and I don't 
always like it myself. But you listen 
to me: I
didn't make it, and I know that I can't 
change it. But I've made my place in
it and I'll have every Negro in the 
country hanging on tree limbs by morning
if it means staying where I am."
He was looking me in the eye now, his 
voice charged and sincere, as
though uttering a confession, a 
fantastic revelation which I could 
neither
believe nor deny. Cold drops of sweat 
moved at a glacier's pace down my
spine . . .
"I mean it, son," he said. "I had to be 
strong and purposeful to get
where I am. I had to wait and plan and 
lick around . . . Yes, I had to act
the nigger!" he said, adding another 
fiery, "Yes!
"I don't even insist that it was worth 
it, but now I'm here and I
mean to stay -- after you win the game, 
you take the prize and you keep it,
protect it; there's nothing else to 
do." He shrugged. "A man gets old 
winning
his place, son. So you go ahead, go 
tell your story; match your truth 
against
my truth, because what I've said is 
truth, the broader truth. Test it, try 
it out
. . . When I started out I was a young 
fellow . . ."
But I no longer listened, nor saw more 
than the play of light upon
the metallic disks of his glasses, 
which now seemed to float within the
disgusting sea of his words. Truth, 
truth, what was truth? Nobody I knew,
not even my own mother, would believe 
me if I tried to tell them. Nor would
I tomorrow, I thought, nor would I . . 
. I gazed helplessly at the grain of the
desk, then past his head to the case of 
loving cups behind his chair. Above
the case a portrait of the Founder 
looked noncommittally down.
"Hee, hee!" Bledsoe laughed. "Your arms 
are too short to box with
me, son. And I haven't had to really 
clip a young Negro in years. No," he
said getting up, "they haven't been so 
cocky as they used to."

This time I could barely move, my 
stomach was knotted and my
kidneys ached. My legs were rubbery. 
For three years I had thought of myself
as a man and here with a few words he'd 
made me as helpless as an infant.
I pulled myself up . . .
"Wait, hold on a second," he said, 
looking at me like a man about to
flip a coin. "I like your spirit, son. 
You're a fighter, and I like that; you 
just
lack judgment, though lack of judgment 
can ruin you. That's why I have to
penalize you, son. I know how you feel, 
too. You don't want to go home to
be humiliated, I understand that, 
because you have some vague notions 
about
dignity. In spite of me, such notions 
seep in along with the gimcrack teachers
and northern-trained idealists. Yes, 
and you have some white folk backing you
and you don't want to face them because 
nothing is worse for a black man
than to be humiliated by white folk. I 
know all about that too; ole doc's been
'buked and scorned and all of that. I 
don't just sing about it in chapel, I
know about it. But you'll get over it; 
it's foolish and expensive and a lot of
dead weight. You let the white folk 
worry about pride and dignity -- you
learn where you are and get yourself 
power, influence, contacts with powerful
and influential people -- then stay in 
the dark and use it!"
How long will I stand here and let him 
laugh at me, I thought,
holding on to the back of the chair, 
how long?
"You're a nervy little fighter, son," 
he said, "and the race needs good,
smart, disillusioned fighters. 
Therefore I'm going to give you a hand 
-- maybe
you'll feel that I'm giving you my left 
hand after I've struck you with my
right -- if you think I'm the kind of 
man who'd lead with his right, which
I'm most certainly not. But that's all 
right too, take it or leave it. I want 
you
to go to New York for the summer and 
save your pride -- and your money.
You go there and earn your next year's 
fees, understand?"
I nodded, unable to speak, whirling 
about furiously within myself,
trying to deal with him, to fit what he 
was saying to what he had said . . .
"I'll give you letters to some of the 
school's friends to see that you
get work," he said. "But this time, use 
your judgment, keep your eyes open,
get in the swing of things! Then, if 
you make good, perhaps . . . well,
perhaps . . . It's up to you."
His voice stopped as he stood, tall and 
black and disk-eyed, huge.
"That's all, young man," he said, his 
tone abrupt, official. "You have

two days in which to close your 
affairs."
"Two days?"
"Two days!" he said.
I went down the steps and up the walk 
in the dark, making it out of
the building just before it bent me 
double beneath the wisteria that hung
from the trees on rope-like vines. 
Almost a total disembowelment and when 
it
paused I looked up through the trees 
arched high and cool above me to see
a whirling, double-imaged moon. My eyes 
were out of focus. I started toward
my room, covering one eye with my hand 
to avoid crashing into trees and
lampposts projected into my path. I 
went on, tasting bile and thankful that 
it
was night with no one to witness my 
condition. My stomach felt raw. From
somewhere across the quiet of the 
campus the sound of an old guitar-blues
plucked from an out-of-tune piano 
drifted toward me like a lazy, 
shimmering
wave, like the echoed whistle of a 
lonely train, and my head went over 
again,
against a tree this time, and I could 
hear it splattering the flowering vines.
When I could move, my head started to 
whirl in a circle. The day's
events flowed past. Trueblood, Mr. 
Norton, Dr. Bledsoe and the Golden Day
swept around my mind in a mad surreal 
whirl. I stood in the path holding
my eye and trying to push back the day, 
but each time I floundered upon
Dr. Bledsoe's decision. It still echoed 
in my mind and it was real and it was
final. Whatever my responsibility was 
for what had occurred, I knew that I
would pay for it, knew that I would be 
expelled, and the very idea stabbed
my insides again. I stood there on the 
moonlit walk, trying to think ahead to
its effects, imagining the satisfaction 
of those who envied my success, the
shame and disappointment of my parents. 
I would never live down my
disgrace. My white friends would be 
disgusted and I recalled the fear that
hung over all those who had no 
protection from powerful whites.
How had I come to this? I had kept 
unswervingly to the path placed
before me, had tried to be exactly what 
I was expected to be, had done
exactly what I was expected to do -- 
yet, instead of winning the expected
reward, here I was stumbling along, 
holding on desperately to one of my eyes
in order to keep from bursting out my 
brain against some familiar object
swerved into my path by my distorted 
vision. And now to drive me wild I
felt

suddenly

that

my

grandfather

was

hovering

over

me,

grinning

triumphantly out of the dark. I simply 
could not endure it. For, despite my

anguish and anger, I knew of no other 
way of living, nor other forms of
success available to such as me. I was 
so completely a part of that existence
that in the end I had to make my peace. 
It was either that or admit that my
grandfather had made sense. Which was 
impossible, for though I still believed
myself innocent, I saw that the only 
alternative to permanently facing the
world of Trueblood and the Golden Day 
was to accept the responsibility for
what had happened. Somehow, I convinced 
myself, I had violated the code
and thus would have to submit to 
punishment. Dr. Bledsoe is right, I told
myself, he's right; the school and what 
it stands for have to be protected.
There was no other way, and no matter 
how much I suffered I would pay my
debt as quickly as possible and return 
to building my career . . .
Back in my room I counted my savings, 
some fifty dollars, and
decided to get to New York as quickly 
as possible. If Dr. Bledsoe didn't
change his mind about helping me get a 
job, it would be enough to pay my
room and board at Men's House, about 
which I had learned from fellows who
lived there during their summer 
vacations. I would leave in the morning.
So while my roommate grinned and 
mumbled unaware in his sleep I
packed my bags.

NEXT morning I was up before the bugle 
sounded and already on a
bench in Dr. Bledsoe's outer office 
when he appeared. The jacket of his blue
serge suit was open, revealing a heavy 
gold chain linked between his vest
pockets as he moved toward me with a 
noiseless tread. He passed without
seeming to see me. Then as he reached 
his office door he said, "I haven't
changed my mind about you, boy. And I 
don't intend to!"
"Oh, I didn't come for that, sir," I 
said, seeing him turn quickly,
looking down upon me, his eyes 
quizzical.
"Very well, as long as you understand 
that. Come in and state your
business. I have work to do."
I waited before the desk, watching him 
place his homburg on an old
brass hall-tree. Then he sat before me, 
making a cage of his fingers and
nodding for me to begin.
My eyes burned and my voice sounded 
unreal. "I'd like to leave this
morning, sir," I said.

His eyes retreated. "Why this morning?" 
he said. "I gave you until
tomorrow. Why the hurry?"
"It isn't hurry, sir. But since I have 
to leave I'd like to get going.
Staying until tomorrow won't change 
matters . . ."
"No, it won't," he said. "That's good 
sense and you have my
permission. And what else?"
"That's all, sir, except that I want to 
say that I'm sorry for what I
did and that I hold no hard feelings. 
What I did was unintentional, but I'm
in agreement with my punishment."
He

touched

his

fingertips

together,

the

thick

fingers

meeting

delicately, his face without 
expression. "That's the proper 
attitude," he said.
"In other words, you don't intend to 
become bitter, is that it?"
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, I can see that you're beginning 
to learn. That's good. Two
things our people must do is accept 
responsibility for their acts and avoid
becoming bitter." His voice rose with 
the conviction of his chapel speeches.
"Son, if you don't become bitter, 
nothing can stop you from success.
Remember that."
"I shall, sir," I said. Then my throat 
thickened and I hoped he would
bring up the matter of a job himself.
Instead, he looked at me impatiently 
and said, "Well? I have work to
do. My permission is granted."
"Well, sir, I'd like to ask a favor of 
you . . ."
"Favor," he said shrewdly. "Now that's 
another matter. What kind of
favor?"
"It isn't much, sir. You suggested that 
you would put me in touch
with some of the trustees who would 
give me a job. I'm willing to do
anything."
"Oh, yes," he said, "yes, of course."

.

He seemed to think for a moment, his 
eyes studying the objects on
his desk. Then touching the shackle 
gently with his index finger, he said,
"Very well. When do you intend to 
leave?"
"By the first bus, if possible, sir."
"Are you packed?"
"Yes, sir."

"Very well. Go get your bags and return 
here in thirty minutes. My
secretary will give you some letters 
addressed to several friends of the 
school.
One of them will do something for you."
"Thanks, sir. Thank you very much," I 
said as he stood.
"That's all right," he said. "The 
school tries to look out for its own.
Only one thing more. These letters will 
be sealed; don't open them if you
want help. White folk are strict about 
such things. The letters will introduce
you and request them to help you with a 
job. I'll do my best for you and it
isn't necessary for you to open them, 
understand?"
"Oh, I wouldn't think of opening them, 
sir," I said.
"Very well, the young lady will have 
them for you when you return.
What about your parents, have you 
informed them?"
"No, sir, it might make them feel too 
bad if I told them I was
expelled, so I plan to write them after 
I get there and get a job . . ."
"I see. Perhaps that is best."
"Well, good-bye, sir," I said, 
extending my hand.
"Good-bye," he said. His hand was large 
and strangely limp.
He pressed a buzzer as I turned to 
leave. His secretary brushed past
me as I went through the door.
The letters were waiting when I 
returned, seven of them, addressed
to men with impressive names. I looked 
for Mr. Norton's but his was not
among them. Placing them carefully in 
my inside pocket, I grabbed my bags
and hurried for the bus.

Chapter 7
The station was empty, but the ticket 
window was open and a porter
in a gray uniform was pushing a broom. 
I bought my ticket and climbed into
the bus. There were only two passengers 
seated at the rear of the red and
nickel interior, and I suddenly felt 
that I was dreaming. It was the vet, who
gave me a smile of recognition; an 
attendant sat beside him.

"Welcome, young man," he called. 
"Imagine, Mr. Crenshaw," he said
to the attendant, "we have a traveling 
companion!"
"Morning," I said reluctantly. I looked 
around for a seat away from
them, but although the bus was almost 
empty, only the rear was reserved for
us and there was nothing to do but move 
back with them. I didn't like it;
the vet was too much a part of an 
experience which I was already trying to
blot out of my consciousness. His way 
of talking to Mr. Norton had been a
foreshadowing of my misfortune -- just 
as I had sensed that it would be.
Now

having

accepted

my

punishment,

I wanted

to

remember nothing

connected with Trueblood or the Golden 
Day.
Crenshaw, a much smaller man than 
Supercargo, said nothing. He
was not the type usually sent out to 
accompany violent cases and I was glad
until I remembered that the only 
violent thing about the vet was his 
tongue.
His mouth had already gotten me into 
trouble and now I hoped he wouldn't
turn it upon the white driver -- that 
was apt to get us killed. What was he
doing on the bus anyway? God, how had 
Dr. Bledsoe worked that fast? I
stared at the fat man.
"How did your friend Mr. Norton make 
out?" he asked.
"He's okay," I said.
"No more fainting spells?"
"No."
"Did he bawl you out for what happened?"
"He didn't blame me," I said.
"Good. I think I shocked him more than 
anything else he saw at the
Golden Day. I hoped I hadn't caused you 
trouble. School isn't out so soon, is
it?"
"Not quite," I said lightly. "I'm 
leaving early in order to take a job."
"Wonderful! At home?"
"No, I thought I might make more money 
in New York."
"New York!" he said. "That's not a 
place, it's a dream. When I was
your age it was Chicago. Now all the 
little black boys run away to New York.
Out of the fire into the melting pot. I 
can see you after you've lived in
Harlem for three months. Your speech 
will change, you'll talk a lot about
'college,' you'll attend lectures at 
the Men's House . . . you might even 
meet
a few white folks. And listen," he 
said, leaning close to whisper, "you 
might

even dance with a white girl!"
"I'm going to New York to work," I 
said, looking around me. "I won't
have time for that."
"You will though," he teased. "Deep 
down you're thinking about the
freedom you've heard about up North, 
and you'll try it once, just to see if
what you've heard is true."
"There's other kinds of freedom beside 
some ole white trash women,"
Crenshaw said. "He might want to see 
him some shows and eat in some of
them big restaurants."
The vet grinned. "Why, of course, but 
remember, Crenshaw, he's only
going to be there a few months. Most of 
the time he'll be working, and so
much of his freedom will have to be 
symbolic. And what will be his or any
man's most easily accessible symbol of 
freedom? Why, a woman, of course. In
twenty minutes he can inflate that 
symbol with all the freedom which he'll 
be
too busy working to enjoy the rest of 
the time. He'll see."
I tried to change the subject. "Where 
are you going?" I asked.
"To Washington, D. C.," he said.
"Then you're cured?"
"Cured? There is no cure --"
"He's being transferred," said Crenshaw.
"Yes, I'm headed for St. Elizabeth's," 
the vet said. "The ways of
authority are indeed mysterious. For a 
year I've tried to get transferred, then
this morning I'm suddenly told to pack. 
I can't but wonder if our little
conversation with your friend Mr. 
Norton had something to do with it."
"How could he have anything to do with 
it?" I said, remembering Dr.
Bledsoe's threat.
"How could he have anything to do with 
your being on this bus?" he
said.
He winked. His eyes twinkled. "All 
right, forget what I've said. But
for God's sake, learn to look beneath 
the surface," he said. "Come out of the
fog, young man. And remember you don't 
have to be a complete fool in
order to succeed. Play the game, but 
don't believe in it -- that much you owe
yourself. Even if it lands you in a 
strait jacket or a padded cell. Play the
game, but play it your own way -- part 
of the time at least. Play the game,
but raise the ante, my boy. Learn how 
it operates, learn how you operate -- I

wish I had time to tell you only a 
fragment. We're an ass-backward people,
though. You might even beat the game. 
It's really a very crude affair. Really
Pre-Renaissance -- and that game has 
been analyzed, put down in books. But
down here they've forgotten to take 
care of the books and that's your
opportunity. You're hidden right out in 
the open -- that is, you would be if
you only realized it. They wouldn't see 
you because they don't expect you to
know anything, since they believe 
they've taken care of that . . ."
"Man, who's this they you talking so 
much about?" said Crenshaw.
The vet looked annoyed. "They?" he 
said. "They? Why, the same they
we always mean, the white folks, 
authority, the gods, fate, 
circumstances -the force that pulls 
your strings until you refuse to be 
pulled any more. The
big man who's never there, where you 
think he is."
Crenshaw grimaced. "You talk too damn 
much, man," he said. "You
talk and you don't say nothing."
"Oh, I have a lot to say, Crenshaw. I 
put into words things which
most men feel, if only slightly. Sure, 
I'm a compulsive talker of a kind, but
I'm really more clown than fool. But, 
Crenshaw," he said, rolling a wand of
the

newspaper

which

lay

across

his

knees,

"you

don't

realize

what's

happening. Our young friend is going 
North for the first time! It is for the
first time, isn't it?"
"You're right," I said.
"Of course. Were you ever North before, 
Crenshaw?"
"I been all over the country," Crenshaw 
said. "I know how they do it,
wherever they do it. And I know how to 
act too. Besides, you ain't going
North, not the real North. You going to 
Washington. It's just another
southern town."
"Yes, I know," the vet said, "but think 
of what this means for the
young fellow. He's going free, in the 
broad daylight and alone. I can
remember when young fellows like him 
had first to commit a crime, or be
accused of one, before they tried such 
a thing. Instead of leaving in the light
of morning, they went in the dark of 
night. And no bus was fast enough 
-isn't that so, Crenshaw?"
Crenshaw stopped unwrapping a candy bar 
and looked at him
sharply, his eyes narrowed. "How the 
hell I know?" he said.
"I'm sorry, Crenshaw," the vet said. "I 
thought that as a man of

experience . . ."
"Well, I ain't had that experience. I 
went North of my own free will."
"But haven't you heard of such cases?"
"Hearing ain't 'speriencing," Crenshaw 
said.
"No, it isn't. But since there's always 
an element of crime in freedom
--"
"I ain't committed no crime!"
"I didn't mean that you had," the vet 
said. "I apologize. Forget it."
Crenshaw took an angry bite from his 
candy bar, mumbling, "I wish
you'd hurry up and git depressive, 
maybe then you won't talk so damn
much."
"Yes, doctor," the vet said mockingly. 
"I'll be depressive soon enough,
but while you eat your candy just allow 
me to chew the rag; there's a kind of
substance in it."
"Aw, quit trying to show off your 
education," Crenshaw said. "You
riding back here in the Jim Crow just 
like me. Besides, you're a nut."
The vet winked at me, continuing his 
flow of words as the bus got
under way. We were going at last and I 
took a last longing look as the bus
shot around the highway which circled 
the school. I turned and watched it
recede from the rear window; the sun 
caught its treetops, bathed its low-set
buildings and ordered grounds. Then it 
was gone. In less than five minutes
the spot of earth which I identified 
with the best of all possible worlds was
gone, lost within the wild uncultivated 
countryside. A flash of movement drew
my eye to the side of the highway now, 
and I saw a moccasin wiggle swiftly
along the gray concrete, vanishing into 
a length of iron pipe that lay beside
the road. I watched the flashing past 
of cotton fields and cabins, feeling 
that
I was moving into the unknown.
The vet and Crenshaw prepared to change 
busses at the next stop,
and upon leaving, the vet placed his 
hand upon my shoulder and looked at
me with kindness, and, as always, he 
smiled.
"Now is the time for offering fatherly 
advice," he said, "but I'll have
to spare you that -- since I guess I'm 
nobody's father except my own.
Perhaps that's the advice to give you: 
Be your own father, young man. And
remember, the world is possibility if 
only you'll discover it. Last of all, 
leave
the Mr. Nortons alone, and if you don't 
know what I mean, think about it.

Farewell."
I watched him following Crenshaw 
through the group of passengers
waiting to get on, a short, comical 
figure turning to wave, then 
disappearing
through the door of the red brick 
terminal. I sat back with a sigh of 
relief,
yet once the passengers were aboard and 
the bus under way again, I felt sad
and utterly alone.

NOT until we were sailing through the 
Jersey countryside did my
spirits begin to rise. Then my old 
confidence and optimism revived, and I
tried to plan my time in the North. I 
would work hard and serve my
employer so well that he would shower 
Dr. Bledsoe with favorable reports.
And I would save my money and return in 
the fall full of New York culture.
I'd be indisputably the leading campus 
figure. Perhaps I would attend Town
Meeting, which I had heard over the 
radio. I'd learn the platform tricks of
the leading speakers. And I would make 
the best of my contacts. When I met
the big men to whom my letters were 
addressed I would put on my best
manner. I would speak softly, in my 
most polished tones, smile agreeably and
be most polite; and I would remember 
that if he ("he" meant any of the
important gentlemen) should begin a 
topic of conversation (I would never
begin a subject of my own) which I 
found unfamiliar, I would smile and
agree. My shoes would be polished, my 
suit pressed, my hair dressed (not too
much grease) and parted on the right 
side; my nails would be clean and my
armpits well deodorized -- you had to 
watch the last item. You couldn't allow
them to think all of us smelled bad. 
The very thought of my contacts gave
me a feeling of sophistication, of 
worldliness, which, as I fingered the 
seven
important letters in my pocket, made me 
feel light and expansive.
I dreamed with my eyes gazing blankly 
upon the landscape until I
looked up to see a Red Cap frowning 
down. "Buddy, are you getting off
here?" he said. "If so, you better get 
started."
"Oh, sure," I said, beginning to move. 
"Sure, but how do you get to
Harlem?"
"That's easy," he said. "You just keep 
heading north."
And while I got down my bags and my 
prize brief case, still as shiny
as the night of the battle royal, he 
instructed me how to take the subway,

then I struggled through the crowd.
Moving

into

the

subway

I

was

pushed

along

by

the

milling

salt-and-pepper mob, seized in the back 
by a burly, blue-uniformed attendant
about the size of Supercargo, and 
crammed, bags and all, into a train that
was so crowded that everyone seemed to 
stand with his head back and his
eyes bulging, like chickens frozen at 
the sound of danger. Then the door
banged behind me and I was crushed 
against a huge woman in black who
shook her head and smiled while I 
stared with horror at a large mole that
arose out of the oily whiteness of her 
skin like a black mountain sweeping
out of a rainwet plain. And all the 
while I could feel the rubbery softness 
of
her flesh against the length of my 
body. I could neither turn sideways nor
back away, nor set down my bags. I was 
trapped, so close that simply by
nodding my head, I might have brushed 
her lips with mine. I wanted
desperately to raise my hands to show 
her that it was against my will. I kept
expecting her to scream, until finally 
the car lurched and I was able to free
my left arm. I closed my eyes, holding 
desperately to my lapel. The car
roared and swayed, pressing me hard 
against her, but when I took a furtive
glance around no one was paying me the 
slightest attention. And even she
seemed lost in her own thoughts. The 
train seemed to plunge downhill now,
only to lunge to a stop that shot me 
out upon a platform feeling like
something regurgitated from the belly 
of a frantic whale. Wrestling with my
bags, I swept along with the crowd, up 
the stairs into the hot street. I didn't
care where I was, I would walk the rest 
of the way.
For a moment I stood before a shop 
window staring at my own
reflection in the glass, trying to 
recover from the ride against the 
woman. I
was limp, my clothing wet. "But you're 
up North now," I told myself, "up
North." Yes, but suppose she had 
screamed . . . The next time I used the
subway I'd always be sure to enter with 
my hands grasping my lapels and I'd
keep them there until I left the train. 
Why, my God, they must have riots on
those things all the time. Why hadn't I 
read about them?
I had never seen so many black people 
against a background of brick
buildings, neon signs, plate glass and 
roaring traffic -- not even on trips I
had made with the debating team to New 
Orleans, Dallas or Birmingham.
They were everywhere. So many, and 
moving along with so much tension and
noise that I wasn't sure whether they 
were about to celebrate a holiday or

join in a street fight. There were even 
black girls behind the counters of the
Five and Ten as I passed. Then at the 
street intersection I had the shock of
seeing a black policeman directing 
traffic -- and there were white drivers 
in
the traffic who obeyed his signals as 
though it was the most natural thing in
the world. Sure I had heard of it, but 
this was real. My courage returned.
This really was Harlem, and now all the 
stories which I had heard of the
city-within-a-city leaped alive in my 
mind. The vet had been right: For me
this was not a city of realities, but 
of dreams; perhaps because I had always
thought of my life as being confined to 
the South. And now as I struggled
through the lines of people a new world 
of possibility suggested itself to me
faintly, like a small voice that was 
barely audible in the roar of city 
sounds. I
moved wide-eyed, trying to take the 
bombardment of impressions. Then I
stopped still.
It was ahead of me, angry and shrill, 
and upon hearing it I had a
sensation of shock and fear such as I 
had felt as a child when surprised by
my father's voice. An emptiness widened 
in my stomach. Before me a
gathering of people were almost 
blocking the walk, while above them a 
short
squat man shouted angrily from a ladder 
to which were attached a collection
of small American flags.
"We gine chase 'em out," the man cried. 
"Out!"
"Tell 'em about it, Ras, mahn," a voice 
called.
And I saw the squat man shake his fist 
angrily over the uplifted
faces, yelling something in a staccato 
West Indian accent, at which the crowd
yelled threateningly. It was as though 
a riot would break any minute, against
whom I didn't know. I was puzzled, both 
by the effect of his voice upon me
and by the obvious anger of the crowd. 
I had never seen so many black men
angry in public before, and yet others 
passed the gathering by without even a
glance. And as I came alongside, I saw 
two white policemen talking quietly
with one another, their backs turned as 
they laughed at some joke. Even
when the shirt-sleeved crowd cried out 
in angry affirmation of some remark
of the speaker, they paid no attention. 
I was stunned. I stood gaping at the
policemen, my bags settling upon the 
middle of the walk, until one of them
happened to see me and nudged the 
other, who chewed lazily upon a wad of
gum.
"What can we do for you, bud?" he said.

"I was just wondering . . ." I said, 
before I caught myself.
"Yeah?"
"I was just wondering how to get to 
Men's House, sir," I said.
"Is that all?"
"Yes, sir," I stammered.
"You sure?"
"Yes, sir."
"He's a stranger," the other said. 
"Just coming to town, bud?"
"Yes, sir," I said, "I just got off the 
subway."
"You did, huh? Well, you want to be 
careful."
"Oh, I will, sir."
"That's the idea. Keep it clean," he 
said, and directed me to Men's
House.
I thanked them and hurried on. The 
speaker had become more
violent than before and his remarks 
were about the government. The clash
between the calm of the rest of the 
street and the passion of the voice gave
the scene a strange out-of-joint 
quality, and I was careful not to look 
back
lest I see a riot flare.
I reached Men's House in a sweat, 
registered, and went immediately
to my room. I would have to take Harlem 
a little at a time.

Chapter 8
It was a clean little room with a dark 
orange bedspread. The chair
and dresser were maple and there was a 
Gideon Bible lying upon a small
table. I dropped my bags and sat on the 
bed. From the street below came
the sound of traffic, the larger sound 
of the subway, the smaller, more varied
sounds of voices. Alone in the room, I 
could hardly believe that I was so far
away from home, yet there was nothing 
familiar in my surroundings. Except
the

Bible;

I

picked

it

up

and

sat

back

on

the

bed,

allowing

its

blood-red-edged pages to ripple beneath 
my thumb. I remembered how Dr.

Bledsoe could quote from the Book 
during his speeches to the student body
on Sunday nights. I turned to the book 
of Genesis, but could not read. I
thought of home and the attempts my 
father had made to institute family
prayer, the gathering around the stove 
at mealtime and kneeling with heads
bowed over the seats of our chairs, his 
voice quavering and full of
church-house rhetoric and verbal 
humility. But this made me homesick and 
I
put the Bible aside. This was New York. 
I had to get a job and earn money.
I took off my coat and hat and took my 
packet of letters and lay
back upon the bed, drawing a feeling of 
importance from reading the
important names. What was inside, and 
how could I open them undetected?
They were tightly sealed. I had read 
that letters were sometimes steamed
open, but I had no steam. I gave it up, 
I really didn't need to know their
contents and it would not be honorable 
or safe to tamper with Dr. Bledsoe. I
knew already that they concerned me and 
were addressed to some of the
most important men in the whole 
country. That was enough. I caught 
myself
wishing for someone to show the letters 
to, someone who could give me a
proper reflection of my importance. 
Finally, I went to the mirror and gave
myself an admiring smile as I spread 
the letters upon the dresser like a hand
of high trump cards.
Then I began to map my campaign for the 
next day. First, I would
have a shower, then get breakfast. All 
this very early. I'd have to move fast.
With important men like that you had to 
be on time. If you made an
appointment with one of them, you 
couldn't bring them any slow c.p. 
(colored
people's) time. Yes, and I would have 
to get a watch. I would do everything
to schedule. I recalled the heavy gold 
chain that hung between Dr. Bledsoe's
vest pockets and the air with which he 
snapped his watch open to consult
the time, his lips pursed, chin pulled 
in so that it multiplied, his forehead
wrinkled. Then he'd clear his throat 
and give a deeply intoned order, as
though each syllable were pregnant with 
nuances of profoundly important
meaning. I recalled my expulsion, 
feeling quick anger and attempting to
suppress it immediately; but now I was 
not quite successful, my resentment
stuck out at the edges, making me 
uncomfortable. Maybe it was best, I
thought hastily. Maybe if it hadn't 
happened I would never have received an
opportunity to meet such important men 
face to face. In my mind's eye I
continued to see him gazing into his 
watch, but now he was joined by

another figure; a younger figure, 
myself; become shrewd, suave and dressed
not in somber garments (like his 
old-fashioned ones) but in a dapper 
suit of
rich material, cut fashionably, like 
those of the men you saw in magazine 
ads,
the junior executive types in Esquire. 
I imagined myself making a speech and
caught in striking poses by flashing 
cameras, snapped at the end of some
period of dazzling eloquence. A younger 
version of the doctor, less crude,
indeed polished. I would hardly ever 
speak above a whisper and I would
always be -- yes, there was no other 
word, I would be charming. Like Ronald
Colman. What a voice! Of course you 
couldn't speak that way in the South,
the white folks wouldn't like it, and 
the Negroes would say that you were
"putting on." But here in the North I 
would slough off my southern ways of
speech. Indeed, I would have one way of 
speaking in the North and another
in the South. Give them what they 
wanted down South, that was the way. If
Dr. Bledsoe could do it, so could I. 
Before going to bed that night I wiped
off my brief case with a clean towel 
and placed the letters carefully inside.
The next morning I took an early subway 
into the Wall Street
district, selecting an address that 
carried me almost to the end of the 
island.
It was dark with the tallness of the 
buildings and the narrow streets.
Armored cars with alert guards went 
past as I looked for the number. The
streets were full of hurrying people 
who walked as though they had been
wound up and were directed by some 
unseen control. Many of the men
carried dispatch cases and brief cases 
and I gripped mine with a sense of
importance. And here and there I saw 
Negroes who hurried along with
leather pouches strapped to their 
wrists. They reminded me fleetingly of
prisoners carrying their leg irons as 
they escaped from a chain gang. Yet they
seemed aware of some self-importance, 
and I wished to stop one and ask him
why he was chained to his pouch. Maybe 
they got paid well for this, maybe
they were chained to money. Perhaps the 
man with rundown heels ahead of
me was chained to a million dollars!
I looked to see if there were policemen 
or detectives with drawn
guns following, but there was no one. 
Or if so, they were hidden in the
hurrying crowd. I wanted to follow one 
of the men to see where he was
going. Why did they trust him with all 
that money? And what would happen
if he should disappear with it? But of 
course no one would be that foolish.
This was Wall Street. Perhaps it was 
guarded, as I had been told post offices

were guarded, by men who looked down at 
you through peepholes in the
ceiling and walls, watching you 
constantly, silently waiting for a 
wrong move.
Perhaps even now an eye had picked me 
up and watched my every
movement. Maybe the face of that clock 
set in the gray building across the
street hid a pair of searching eyes. I 
hurried to my address and was
challenged by the sheer height of the 
white stone with its sculptured bronze
fa?de. Men and women hurried inside, 
and after staring for a moment I
followed, taking the elevator and being 
pushed to the back of the car. It rose
like a rocket, creating a sensation in 
my crotch as though an important part
of myself had been left below in the 
lobby.
At the last stop I left the car and 
went down a stretch of marble
hallway until I found the door marked 
with the trustee's name. But starting
to enter I lost my nerve and backed 
away. I looked down the hall. It was
empty. White folks were funny; Mr. 
Bates might not wish to see a Negro the
first thing in the morning. I turned 
and walked down the hall and looked out
of the window. I would wait awhile.
Below me lay South Ferry, and a ship 
and two barges were passing
out into the river, and far out and to 
the right I could make out the Statue
of Liberty, her torch almost lost in 
the fog. Back along the shore, gulls 
soared
through the mist above the docks, and 
down, so far below that it made me
dizzy, crowds were moving. I looked 
back to a ferry passing the Statue of
Liberty now, its backwash a curving 
line upon the bay and three gulls
swooping down behind it.
Behind me the elevator was letting off 
passengers, and I heard the
cheery voices of women going chattering 
down the hall. Soon I would have to
go in. My uncertainty grew. My 
appearance worried me. Mr. Bates might 
not
like my suit, or the cut of my hair, 
and my chance of a job would be lost. I
looked at his name typed neatly across 
the envelope and wondered how he
earned his money. He was a millionaire, 
I knew. Maybe he had always been;
maybe he was born a millionaire. Never 
before had I been so curious about
money as now that I believed I was 
surrounded by it. Perhaps I would get a
job here and after a few years would be 
sent up and down the streets with
millions strapped to my arms, a trusted 
messenger. Then I'd be sent South
again to head the college -- just as 
the mayor's cook had been made principal
of the school after she'd become too 
lame to stand before her stove. Only I

wouldn't stay North that long; they'd 
need me before that . . . But now for
the interview.
Entering the office I found myself face 
to face with a young woman
who looked up from her desk as I 
glanced swiftly over the large light 
room,
over the comfortable chairs, the 
ceiling-high bookcases with gold and 
leather
bindings, past a series of portraits 
and back again, to meet her questioning
eyes. She was alone and I thought, 
Well, at least I'm not too early . . .
"Good morning," she said, betraying 
none of the antagonism I had
expected.
"Good morning," I said, advancing. How 
should I begin?
"Yes?"
"Is this Mr. Bates' office?" I said.
"Why, yes, it is," she said. "Have you 
an appointment?"
"No, ma'm," I said, and quickly hated 
myself for saying "ma'm" to so
young a white woman, and in the North 
too. I removed the letter from my
brief case, but before I could explain, 
she said,
"May I see it, please?"
I hesitated. I did not wish to 
surrender the letter except to Mr.
Bates, but there was a command in the 
extended hand, and I obeyed. I
surrendered it, expecting her to open 
it, but instead, after looking at the
envelope she rose and disappeared 
behind a paneled door without a word.
Back across the expanse of carpet to 
the door which I had entered I
noticed several chairs but was 
undecided to go there. I stood, my hat 
in my
hand, looking around me. One wall 
caught my eyes. It was hung with three
portraits of dignified old gentlemen in 
winged collars who looked down from
their frames with an assurance and 
arrogance that I had never seen in any
except white men and a few bad, 
razor-scarred Negroes. Not even Dr.
Bledsoe, who had but to look around him 
without speaking to set the
teachers to trembling, had such 
assurance. So these were the kind of men
who stood behind him. How did they fit 
in with the southern white folks,
with the men who gave me my 
scholarship? I was still staring, 
caught in the
spell of power and mystery, when the 
secretary returned.
She looked at me oddly and smiled. "I'm 
very sorry," she said, "but
Mr. Bates is just too busy to see you 
this morning and asks that you leave
your name and address. You'll hear from 
him by mail."

I stood silent with disappointment. 
"Write it here," she said, giving
me a card.
"I'm sorry," she said again as I 
scribbled my address and prepared to
leave.
"I can be reached here at any time," I 
said.
"Very good," she said. "You should hear 
very soon."
She seemed very kind and interested, 
and I left in good spirits. My
fears were groundless, there was 
nothing to it. This was New York.
I succeeded in reaching several 
trustees' secretaries during the days
that followed, and all were friendly 
and encouraging. Some looked at me
strangely, but I dismissed it since it 
didn't appear to be antagonism. Perhaps
they're surprised to see someone like 
me with introductions to such important
men, I thought. Well, there were unseen 
lines that ran from North to South,
and Mr. Norton had called me his 
destiny . . . I swung my brief case with
confidence.
With things going so well I distributed 
my letters in the mornings,
and saw the city during the afternoons. 
Walking about the streets, sitting on
subways beside whites, eating with them 
in the same cafeterias (although I
avoided their tables) gave me the 
eerie, out-of-focus sensation of a 
dream. My
clothes felt ill-fitting; and for all 
my letters to men of power, I was 
unsure of
how I should act. For the first time, 
as I swung along the streets, I thought
consciously of how I had conducted 
myself at home. I hadn't worried too
much about whites as people. Some were 
friendly and some were not, and
you tried not to offend either. But 
here they all seemed impersonal; and yet
when most impersonal they startled me 
by being polite, by begging my
pardon after brushing against me in a 
crowd. Still I felt that even when they
were polite they hardly saw me, that 
they would have begged the pardon of
Jack the Bear, never glancing his way 
if the bear happened to be walking
along minding his business. It was 
confusing. I did not know if it was
desirable or undesirable . . .
But my main concern was seeing the 
trustees and after more than a
week of seeing the city and being 
vaguely encouraged by secretaries, I 
became
impatient. I had distributed all but 
the letter to a Mr. Emerson, who I knew
from the papers was away from the city. 
Several times I started down to see
what had happened but changed my mind. 
I did not wish to seem too

impatient. But time was becoming short. 
Unless I found work soon I would
never earn enough to enter school by 
fall. I had already written home that I
was working for a member of the trustee 
board, and the only letter I had
received so far was one telling me how 
wonderful they thought it was and
warning me against the ways of the 
wicked city. Now I couldn't write them
for money without revealing that I had 
been lying about the job.
Finally I tried to reach the important 
men by telephone, only to
receive polite refusals by their 
secretaries. But fortunately I still 
had the letter
to Mr. Emerson. I decided to use it, 
but instead of handing it over to a
secretary, I wrote a letter explaining 
that I had a message from Dr. Bledsoe
and requesting an appointment. Maybe 
I've been wrong about the secretaries,
I thought; maybe they destroyed the 
letters. I should have been more 
careful.
I thought of Mr. Norton. If only the 
last letter had been addressed to
him. If only he lived in New York so 
that I could make a personal appeal!
Somehow I felt closer to Mr. Norton, 
and felt that if he should see me, he
would remember that it was I whom he 
connected so closely to his fate. Now
it seemed ages ago and in a different 
season and a distant land. Actually, it
was less than a month. I became 
energetic and wrote him a letter, 
expressing
my belief that my future would be 
immeasurably different if only I could
work for him; that he would be 
benefited as well as I. I was especially
careful to allow some indication of my 
ability to come through the appeal. I
spent several hours on the typing, 
destroying copy after copy until I had
completed one that was immaculate, 
carefully phrased and most respectful. I
hurried down and posted it before the 
final mail collection, suddenly seized
with the dizzy conviction that it would 
bring results. I remained about the
building for three days awaiting an 
answer. But the letter brought no reply.
Nor, any more than a prayer unanswered 
by God, was it returned.
My doubts grew. Perhaps all was not 
well. I remained in my room
all the next day. I grew conscious that 
I was afraid; more afraid here in my
room than I had ever been in the South. 
And all the more, because here
there was nothing concrete to lay it 
to. All the secretaries had been
encouraging. In the evening I went out 
to a movie, a picture of frontier life
with heroic Indian fighting and 
struggles against flood, storm and 
forest fire,
with the out-numbered settlers winning 
each engagement; an epic of wagon
trains rolling ever westward. I forgot 
myself (although there was no one like

me taking part in the adventures) and 
left the dark room in a lighter mood.
But that night I dreamed of my 
grandfather and awoke depressed. I 
walked
out of the building with a queer 
feeling that I was playing a part in 
some
scheme which I did not understand. 
Somehow I felt that Bledsoe and Norton
were behind it, and all day I was 
inhibited in both speech and conduct, 
for
fear that I might say or do something 
scandalous. But this was all fantastic, 
I
told myself. I was being too impatient. 
I could wait for the trustees to make
a move. Perhaps I was being subjected 
to a test of some kind. They hadn't
told me the rules, I knew, but the 
feeling persisted. Perhaps my exile 
would
end suddenly and I would be given a 
scholarship to return to the campus.
But when? How long?
Something had to happen soon. I would 
have to find a job to tide
me over. My money was almost gone and 
anything might happen. I had been
so confident that I had failed to put 
aside the price of train fare home. I 
was
miserable and I dared not talk to 
anyone about my problems; not even the
officials at Men's House, for since 
they had learned that I was to be 
assigned
to an important job, they treated me 
with a certain deference; therefore I 
was
careful to hide my growing doubts. 
After all, I thought, I might have to 
ask
for credit and I'll have to appear a 
good risk. No, the thing to do was to
keep faith. I'd start out once more in 
the morning. Something was certain to
happen tomorrow. And it did. I received 
a letter from Mr. Emerson.

Chapter 9
It was a clear, bright day when I went 
out, and the sun burned
warm upon my eyes. Only a few flecks of 
snowy cloud hung high in the
morning-blue sky, and already a woman 
was hanging wash on a roof. I felt
better walking along. A feeling of 
confidence grew. Far down the island the
skyscrapers rose tall and mysterious in 
the thin, pastel haze. A milk truck
went past. I thought of the school. 
What were they doing now on the
campus? Had the moon sunk low and the 
sun climbed clear? Had the

breakfast bugle blown? Did the bellow 
of the big seed bull awaken the girls
in the dorms this morning as on most 
spring mornings when I was there 
-sounding clear and full above bells 
and bugles and early workaday sounds? I
hurried along, encouraged by the 
memories, and suddenly I was seized 
with a
certainty that today was the day. 
Something would happen. I patted my 
brief
case, thinking of the letter inside. 
The last had been first -- a good sign.
Close to the curb ahead I saw a man 
pushing a cart piled high with
rolls of blue paper and heard him 
singing in a clear ringing voice. It 
was a
blues, and I walked along behind him 
remembering the times that I had
heard such singing at home. It seemed 
that here some memories slipped
around my life at the campus and went 
far back to things I had long ago
shut out of my mind. There was no 
escaping such reminders.
"She's got feet like a monkey
Legs like a frog -- Lawd, Lawd!
But when she starts to loving me
I holler Whoooo, God-dog!
Cause I loves my baabay,
Better than I do myself . . ."
And as I drew alongside I was startled 
to hear him call to me:
"Looka-year, buddy . . ."
"Yes," I said, pausing to look into his 
reddish eyes.
"Tell me just one thing this very fine 
morning -- Hey! Wait a
minute, daddy-o, I'm going your way!"
"What is it?" I said.
"What I want to know is," he said, "is 
you got the dog?"
"Dog? What dog?"
"Sho," he said, stopping his cart and 
resting it on its support. "That's
it. Who --" he halted to crouch with 
one foot on the curb like a country
preacher about to pound his Bible -- 
"got . . . the . . . dog," his head
snapping with each word like an angry 
rooster's.
I laughed nervously and stepped back. 
He watched me out of shrewd
eyes. "Oh, goddog, daddy-o," he said 
with a sudden bluster, "who got the
damn dog? Now I know you from down 
home, how come you trying to act

like you never heard that before! Hell, 
ain't nobody out here this morning but
us colored -- Why you trying to deny 
me?"
Suddenly I was embarrassed and angry. 
"Deny you? What do you
mean?"
"Just answer the question. Is you got 
him, or ain't you?"
"A dog?"
"Yeah, the dog."
I was exasperated. "No, not this 
morning," I said and saw a grin
spread over his face.
"Wait a minute, daddy. Now don't go get 
mad. Damn, man! I
thought sho you had him," he said, 
pretending to disbelieve me. I started
away and he pushed the cart beside me. 
And suddenly I felt uncomfortable.
Somehow he was like one of the vets 
from the Golden Day . . .
"Well, maybe it's the other way round," 
he said. "Maybe he got holt
to you."
"Maybe," I said.
"If he is, you lucky it's just a dog -- 
'cause, man, I tell you I believe
it's a bear that's got holt to me."
"A bear?"
"Hell, yes! The bear. Caint you see 
these patches where he's been
clawing at my behind?"
Pulling the seat of his Charlie Chaplin 
pants to the side, he broke
into deep laughter.
"Man, this Harlem ain't nothing but a 
bear's den. But I tell you one
thing," he said with swiftly sobering 
face, "it's the best place in the world 
for
you and me, and if times don't get 
better soon I'm going to grab that bear
and turn him every way but loose!"
"Don't let him get you down," I said.
"No, daddy-o, I'm going to start with 
one my own size!"
I tried to think of some saying about 
bears to reply, but remembered
only Jack the Rabbit, Jack the Bear . . 
. who were both long forgotten and
now brought a wave of homesickness. I 
wanted to leave him, and yet I found
a certain comfort in walking along 
beside him, as though we'd walked this
way before through other mornings, in 
other places . . .
"What is all that you have there?" I 
said, pointing to the rolls of

blue paper stacked in the cart.
"Blueprints, man. Here I got 'bout a 
hundred pounds of blueprints
and I couldn't build nothing!"
"What are they blueprints for?" I said.
"Damn if I know -- everything. Cities, 
towns, country clubs. Some
just buildings and houses. I got damn 
near enough to build me a house if I
could live in a paper house like they 
do in Japan. I guess somebody done
changed their plans," he added with a 
laugh. "I asked the man why they
getting rid of all this stuff and he 
said they get in the way so every once 
in
a while they have to throw 'em out to 
make place for the new plans. Plenty
of these ain't never been used, you 
know."
"You have quite a lot," I said.
"Yeah, this ain't all neither. I got a 
coupla loads. There's a day's
work right here in this stuff. Folks is 
always making plans and changing 'em."
"Yes, that's right," I said, thinking 
of my letters, "but that's a
mistake. You have to stick to the plan."
He looked at me, suddenly grave. "You 
kinda young, daddy-o," he
said.
I did not answer. We came to a corner 
at the top of a hill.
"Well, daddy-o, it's been good talking 
with a youngster from the old
country but I got to leave you now. 
This here's one of them good ole
downhill streets. I can coast a while 
and won't be worn out at the end of the
day. Damn if I'm-a let 'em run me into 
my grave. I be seeing you again
sometime -- And you know something?"
"What's that?"
"I thought you was trying to deny me at 
first, but now I be pretty
glad to see you . . ."
"I hope so," I said. "And you take it 
easy."
"Oh, I'll do that. All it takes to get 
along in this here man's town is
a little shit, grit and mother-wit. And 
man, I was bawn with all three. In

--" he spieled with twinkling eyes, his
lips working rapidly. "You dig me, 
daddy?"
"You're going too fast," I said, 
beginning to laugh.

"Okay, I'm slowing down. I'll verse you 
but I won't curse you -- My
name is Peter Wheatstraw, I'm the 
Devil's only son-in-law, so roll 'em! 
You a
southern boy, ain't you?" he said, his 
head to one side like a bear's.
"Yes," I said.
"Well, git with it! My name's Blue and 
I'm coming at you with a
pitchfork. Fe Fi Fo Fum. Who wants to 
shoot the Devil one, Lord God
Stingeroy!"
He had me grinning despite myself. I 
liked his words though I didn't
know the answer. I'd known the stuff 
from childhood, but had forgotten it;
had learned it back of school . . .
"You digging me, daddy?" he laughed. 
"Haw, but look me up
sometimes, I'm a piano player and a 
rounder, a whiskey drinker and a
pavement pounder. I'll teach you some 
good bad habits. You'll need 'em.
Good luck," he said.
"So long," I said and watched him 
going. I watched him push around
the corner to the top of the hill 
leaning sharp against the cart handle, 
and
heard his voice arise, muffled now, as 
he started down.
She's got feet like a monkeeee
Legs
Legs, Legs like a maaad
Bulldog . . .
What does it mean, I thought. I'd heard 
it all my life but suddenly
the strangeness of it came through to 
me. Was it about a woman or about
some strange sphinxlike animal? 
Certainly his woman, no woman, fitted 
that
description. And why describe anyone in 
such contradictory words? Was it a
sphinx? Did old Chaplin-pants, old 
dusty-butt, love her or hate her; or was
he merely singing? What kind of woman 
could love a dirty fellow like that,
anyway? And how could even he love her 
if she were as repulsive as the
song described? I moved ahead. Perhaps 
everyone loved someone; I didn't
know. I couldn't give much thought to 
love; in order to travel far you had to
be detached, and I had the long road 
back to the campus before me. I strode
along, hearing the cartman's song 
become a lonesome, broad-toned whistle
now that flowered at the end of each 
phrase into a tremulous, blue-toned

chord. And in its flutter and swoop I 
heard the sound of a railroad train
highballing it, lonely across the 
lonely night. He was the Devil's 
son-in-law,
all right, and he was a man who could 
whistle a three-toned chord . . . God
damn, I thought, they're a hell of a 
people! And I didn't know whether it was
pride or disgust that suddenly flashed 
over me.
At the corner I turned into a drugstore 
and took a seat at the
counter. Several men were bent over 
plates of food. Glass globes of coffee
simmered above blue flames. I could 
feel the odor of frying bacon reach deep
into my stomach as I watched the 
counterman open the doors of the grill
and turn the lean strips over and bang 
the doors shut again. Above, facing
the counter, a blonde, sun-burned 
college girl smiled down, inviting all 
and
sundry to drink a coke. The counterman 
came over.
"I've got something good for you," he 
said, placing a glass of water
before me. "How about the special?"
"What's the special?"
"Pork chops, grits, one egg, hot 
biscuits and coffee!" He leaned over
the counter with a look that seemed to 
say, There, that ought to excite you,
boy. Could everyone see that I was 
southern?
"I'll have orange juice, toast and 
coffee," I said coldly.
He shook his head, "You fooled me," he 
said, slamming two pieces of
bread into the toaster. "I would have 
sworn you were a pork chop man. Is
that juice large or small?"
"Make it large," I said.
I looked silently at the back of his 
head as he sliced an orange,
thinking, I should order the special 
and get up and walk out. Who does he
think he is?
A seed floated in the thick layer of 
pulp that formed at the top of
the glass. I fished it out with a spoon 
and then downed the acid drink, proud
to have resisted the pork chops and 
grits. It was an act of discipline, a 
sign
of the change that was coming over me 
and which would return me to
college a more experienced man. I would 
be basically the same, I thought,
stirring my coffee, yet so subtly 
changed as to intrigue those who had 
never
been North. It always helped at the 
college to be a little different, 
especially
if you wished to play a leading role. 
It made the folks talk about you, try to
figure you out. I had to be careful 
though, not to speak too much like a

northern Negro; they wouldn't like 
that. The thing to do, I thought with a
smile, was to give them hints that 
whatever you did or said was weighted
with broad and mysterious meanings that 
lay just beneath the surface. They'd
love that. And the vaguer you told 
things, the better. You had to keep them
guessing -- just as they guessed about 
Dr. Bledsoe: Did Dr. Bledsoe stop at
an expensive white hotel when he 
visited New York? Did he go on parties
with the trustees? And how did he act?
"Man, I bet he has him a fine time. 
They tell me when Ole Doc gets
to New York he don't stop for the red 
lights. Say he drinks his good red
whiskey and smokes his good black 
cigars and forgets all about you ole
know-nothing-Negroes down here on the 
campus. Say when he gets up North
he makes everybody call him Mister 
Doctor Bledsoe."
I smiled as the conversation came back 
to my mind. I felt good.
Perhaps it was all to the best that I 
had been sent away. I had learned more.
Heretofore

all

the

campus

gossip

had

seemed

merely

malicious

and

disrespectful; now I could see the 
advantage for Dr. Bledsoe. Whether we
liked him or not, he was never out of 
our minds. That was a secret of
leadership. Strange I should think of 
it now, for although I'd never given it
any thought before, I seemed to have 
known it all along. Only here the
distance from the campus seemed to make 
it clear and hard, and I thought it
without fear. Here it came to hand just 
as easily as the coin which I now
placed on the counter for my breakfast. 
It was fifteen cents and as I felt for
a nickel I took out another dime, 
thinking, Is it an insult when one of us
tips one of them?
I looked for the counterman, seeing him 
serving a plate of pork
chops and grits to a man with a pale 
blond mustache, and stared; then I
slapped the dime on the counter and 
left, annoyed that the dime did not ring
as loud as a fifty-cent piece.

WHEN I reached the door of Mr. 
Emerson's office it occurred to me
that perhaps I should have waited until 
the business of the day was under
way, but I disregarded the idea and 
went ahead. My being early would be, I
hoped, an indication of both how badly 
I wanted work, and how promptly I
would perform any assignment given me. 
Besides, wasn't there a saying that

the first person of the day to enter a 
business would get a bargain? Or was
that said only of Jewish business? I 
removed the letter from my brief case.
Was Emerson a Christian or a Jewish 
name?
Beyond the door it was like a museum. I 
had entered a large
reception room decorated with cool 
tropical colors. One wall was almost
covered by a huge colored map, from 
which narrow red silk ribbons stretched
tautly from each division of the map to 
a series of ebony pedestals, upon
which sat glass specimen jars 
containing natural products of the 
various
countries. It was an importing firm. I 
looked around the room, amazed. There
were paintings, bronzes, tapestries, 
all beautifully arranged. I was dazzled 
and
so taken aback that I almost dropped my 
brief case when I heard a voice
say, "And what would your business be?"
I saw the figure out of a collar ad: 
ruddy face with blond hair
faultlessly in place, a tropical weave 
suit draped handsomely from his broad
shoulders, his eyes gray and nervous 
behind clear-framed glasses.
I explained my appointment. "Oh, yes," 
he said. "May I see the
letter, please?"
I handed it over, noticing the gold 
links in the soft white cuffs as he
extended his hand. Glancing at the 
envelope he looked back at me with a
strange interest in his eyes and said, 
"Have a seat, please. I'll be with you 
in
a moment."
I watched him leave noiselessly, moving 
with a long hip-swinging
stride that caused me to frown. I went 
over and took a teakwood chair with
cushions of emerald-green silk, sitting 
stiffly with my brief case across my
knees. He must have been sitting there 
when I came in, for on a table that
held a beautiful dwarf tree I saw smoke 
rising from a cigarette in a jade ash
tray. An open book, something called 
Totem and Taboo, lay beside it. I
looked across to a lighted case of 
Chinese design which held 
delicate-looking
statues of horses and birds, small 
vases and bowls, each set upon a carved
wooden base. The room was quiet as a 
tomb -- until suddenly there was a
savage beating of wings and I looked 
toward the window to see an eruption
of color, as though a gale had whipped 
up a bundle of brightly colored rags.
It was an aviary of tropical birds set 
near one of the broad windows, through
which, as the clapping of wings settled 
down, I could see two ships plying far
out upon the greenish bay below. A 
large bird began a song, drawing my

eyes to the throbbing of its bright 
blue, red and yellow throat. It was
startling and I watched the surge and 
flutter of the birds as their colors
flared for an instant like an unfurled 
oriental fan. I wanted to go and stand
near the cage for a better view, but 
decided against it. It might seem
unbusinesslike. I observed the room 
from the chair.
These folks are the Kings of the Earth! 
I thought, hearing the bird
make an ugly noise. There was nothing 
like this at the college museum -- or
anywhere else that I had ever been. I 
recalled only a few cracked relics from
slavery times: an iron pot, an ancient 
bell, a set of ankle-irons and links of
chain, a primitive loom, a spinning 
wheel, a gourd for drinking, an ugly
ebony African god that seemed to sneer 
(presented to the school by some
traveling millionaire), a leather whip 
with copper brads, a branding iron with
the double letter MM. Though I had seen 
them very seldom, they were vivid
in my mind. They had not been pleasant 
and whenever I had visited the
room I avoided the glass case in which 
they rested, preferring instead to look
at photographs of the early days after 
the Civil War, the times close to those
blind Barbee had described. And I had 
not looked even at these too often.
I tried to relax; the chair was 
beautiful but hard. Where had the
man gone? Had he shown any antagonism 
when he saw me? I was annoyed
that I had failed to see him first. One 
had to watch such details. Suddenly
there came a harsh cry from the cage, 
and once more I saw a mad flashing
as though the birds had burst into 
spontaneous flame, fluttering and 
beating
their wings maliciously against the 
bamboo bars, only to settle down just as
suddenly when the door opened and the 
blond man stood beckoning, his
hand upon the knob. I went over, tense 
inside me. Had I been accepted or
rejected?
There was a question in his eyes. "Come 
in, please," he said.
"Thank you," I said, waiting to follow 
him.
"Please," he said with a slight smile.
I moved ahead of him, sounding the tone 
of his words for a sign.
"I want to ask you a few questions," he 
said, waving my letter at two
chairs.
"Yes, sir?" I said.
"Tell me, what is it that you're trying 
to accomplish?" he said.
"I want a job, sir, so that I can earn 
enough money to return to

college in the fall."
"To your old school?"
"Yes, sir."
"I see." For a moment he studied me 
silently. "When do you expect
to graduate?"
"Next year, sir. I've completed my 
junior classes . . ."
"Oh, you have? That's very good. And 
how old are you?"
"Almost twenty, sir."
"A junior at nineteen? You are a good 
student."
"Thank you, sir," I said, beginning to 
enjoy the interview.
"Were you an athlete?" he asked.
"No, sir . . ."
"You have the build," he said, looking 
me up and down. "You'd
probably make an excellent runner, a 
sprinter."
"I've never tried, sir."
"And I suppose it's silly even to ask 
what you think of your Alma
Mater?" he said.
"I think it's one of the best in the 
world," I said, hearing my voice
surge with deep feeling.
"I know, I know," he said, with a swift 
displeasure that surprised me.
I became alert again as he mumbled 
something incomprehensible
about "nostalgia for Harvard yard."
"But what if you were offered an 
opportunity to finish your work at
some other college," he said, his eyes 
widening behind his glasses. His smile
had returned.
"Another college?" I asked, my mind 
beginning to whirl.
"Why, yes, say some school in New 
England . . ."
I looked at him speechlessly. Did he 
mean Harvard? Was this good
or bad. Where was it leading? "I don't 
know, sir," I said cautiously. "I've
never thought about it. I've only a 
year more, and, well, I know everyone at
my old school and they know me . . ."
I came to a confused halt, seeing him 
look at me with a sigh of
resignation. What was on his mind? 
Perhaps I had been too frank about
returning to the college, maybe he was 
against our having a higher education
. . . But hell, he's only a secretary . 
. . Or is he?

"I understand," he said calmly. "It was 
presumptuous of me to even
suggest another school. I guess one's 
college is really a kind of mother and
father . . . a sacred matter."
"Yes, sir. That's it," I said in 
hurried agreement.
His eyes narrowed. "But now I must ask 
you an embarrassing
question. Do you mind?"
"Why, no, sir," I said nervously.
"I don't like to ask this, but it's 
quite necessary . . ." He leaned
forward with a pained frown. "Tell me, 
did you read the letter which you
brought to Mr. Emerson? This," he said, 
taking the letter from the table.
"Why, no, sir! It wasn't addressed to 
me, so naturally I wouldn't
think of opening it . . ."
"Of course not, I know you wouldn't," 
he said, fluttering his hand
and sitting erect. "I'm sorry and you 
must dismiss it, like one of those
annoying personal questions you find so 
often nowadays on supposedly
impersonal forms."
I didn't believe him. "But was it 
opened, sir? Someone might have
gone into my things . . ."
"Oh, no, nothing like that. Please 
forget the question . . . And tell
me, please, what are your plans after 
graduation?"
"I'm not sure, sir. I'd like to be 
asked to remain at the college as a
teacher, or as a member of the 
administrative staff. And . . . Well . 
. ."
"Yes? And what else?"
"Well -- er, I guess I'd really like to 
become Dr. Bledsoe's assistant .
. ."
"Oh, I see," he said, sitting back and 
forming his mouth into a
thin-lipped circle. "You're very 
ambitious."
"I guess I am, sir. But I'm willing to 
work hard."
"Ambition is a wonderful force," he 
said, "but sometimes it can be
blinding . . . On the other hand, it 
can make you successful -- like my 
father
. . ." A new edge came into his voice 
and he frowned and looked down at
his hands, which were trembling. "The 
only trouble with ambition is that it
sometimes blinds one to realities . . . 
Tell me, how many of these letters do
you have?"
"I had about seven, sir," I replied, 
confused by his new turn. "They're

-- "
"Seven!" He was suddenly angry.
"Yes, sir, that was all he gave me . . 
."
"And how many of these gentlemen have 
you succeeded in seeing,
may I ask?"
A sinking feeling came over me. "I 
haven't seen any of them
personally, sir."
"And this is your last letter?"
"Yes, sir, it is, but I expect to hear 
from the others . . . They said
--"
"Of course you will, and from all 
seven. They're all loyal Americans."
There was unmistakable irony in his 
voice now, and I didn't know
what to say.
"Seven," he repeated mysteriously. "Oh, 
don't let me upset you," he
said with an elegant gesture of 
self-disgust. "I had a difficult 
session with my
analyst last evening and the slightest 
thing is apt to set me off. Like an
alarm clock without control -- Say!" he 
said, slapping his palm against his
thighs. "What on earth does that mean?" 
Suddenly he was in a state. One
side of his face had begun to twitch 
and swell.
I watched him light a cigarette, 
thinking, What on earth is this all
about?
"Some things are just too unjust for 
words," he said, expelling a
plume of smoke, "and too ambiguous for 
either speech or ideas. By the way,
have you ever been to the Club Calamus?"
"I don't think I've ever heard of it, 
sir," I said.
"You haven't? It's very well known. 
Many of my Harlem friends go
there. It's a rendezvous for writers, 
artists and all kinds of celebrities. 
There's
nothing like it in the city, and by 
some strange twist it has a truly
continental flavor."
"I've never been to a night club, sir. 
I'll have to go there to see what
it's like after I've started earning 
some money," I said, hoping to bring the
conversation back to the problem of 
jobs.
He looked at me with a jerk of his 
head, his face beginning to twitch
again.
"I suppose I've been evading the issue 
again -- as always. Look," he

burst out impulsively. "Do you believe 
that two people, two strangers who
have never seen one another before can 
speak with utter frankness and
sincerity?"
"Sir?"
"Oh, damn! What I mean is, do you 
believe it possible for us, the
two of us, to throw off the mask of 
custom and manners that insulate man
from man, and converse in naked honesty 
and frankness?"
"I don't know what you mean exactly, 
sir." I said.
"Are you sure?"
"I . . ."
"Of course, of course. If I could only 
speak plainly! I'm confusing
you. Such frankness just isn't possible 
because all our motives are impure.
Forget what I just said. I'll try to 
put it this way -- and remember this,
please . . ."
My head spun. He was addressing me, 
leaning forward confidentially,
as though he'd known me for years, and 
I remembered something my
grandfather had said long ago: Don't 
let no white man tell you his business,
'cause after he tells you he's liable 
to git shame he tole it to you and then
he'll hate you. Fact is, he was hating 
you all the time. . .
". . . I want to try to reveal a part 
of reality that is most important
to you -- but I warn you, it's going to 
hurt. No, let me finish," he said,
touching my knee lightly and quickly 
removing his hand as I shifted my
position.
"What I want to do is done very seldom, 
and, to be honest, it
wouldn't happen now if I hadn't 
sustained a series of impossible 
frustrations.
You see -- well, I'm thwarted . . . Oh, 
damn, there I go again, thinking only
of myself . . . We're both frustrated, 
understand? Both of us, and I want to
help you . . ."
"You mean you'll let me see Mr. 
Emerson?"
He frowned. "Please don't seem so happy 
about it, and don't leap to
conclusions. I want to help, but there 
is a tyranny involved . . ."
"A tyranny?" My lungs tightened.
"Yes. That's a way of putting it. 
Because to help you I must
disillusion you . . ."
"Oh, I don't think I mind, sir. Once I 
see Mr. Emerson, it'll be up to

me. All I want to do is speak to him."
"Speak to him," he said, getting 
quickly to his feet and mashing his
cigarette into the tray with shaking 
fingers. "No one speaks to him. He does
the speaking --" Suddenly he broke off. 
"On second thought, perhaps you'd
better leave me your address and I'll 
mail you Mr. Emerson's reply in the
morning. He's really a very busy man."
His whole manner had changed.
"But you said . . ." I stood up, 
completely confused. Was he having
fun with me? "Couldn't you let me talk 
to him for just five minutes?" I
pleaded. "I'm sure I can convince him 
that I'm worthy of a job. And if
there's someone who has tampered with 
my letter, I'll prove my identity . . .
Dr. Bledsoe would --"
"Identity! My God! Who has any identity 
any more anyway? It isn't
so perfectly simple. Look," he said 
with an anguished gesture. "Will you 
trust
me?"
"Why, yes, sir, I trust you."
He leaned forward. "Look," he said, his 
face working violently, "I was
trying to tell you that I know many 
things about you -- not you personally,
but fellows like you. Not much, either, 
but still more than the average. With
us it's still Jim and Huck Finn. A 
number of my friends are jazz musicians,
and I've been around. I know the 
conditions under which you live -- Why 
go
back, fellow? There is so much you 
could do here where there is more
freedom. You won't find what you're 
looking for when you return anyway;
because so much is involved that you 
can't possibly know. Please don't
misunderstand me; I don't say all this 
to impress you. Or to give myself
some kind of sadistic catharsis. Truly, 
I don't. But I do know this world
you're trying to contact -- all its 
virtues and all its unspeakables -- Ha, 
yes,
unspeakables. I'm afraid my father 
considers me one of the unspeakables . 
. .
I'm Huckleberry, you see . . ."
He laughed drily as I tried to make 
sense of his ramblings.
Huckleberry? Why did he keep talking 
about that kid's story? I was puzzled
and annoyed that he could talk to me 
this way because he stood between me
and a job, the campus . . .
"But I only want a job, sir," I said. 
"I only want to make enough
money to return to my studies."

"Of course, but surely you suspect 
there is more to it than that.
Aren't you curious about what lies 
behind the face of things?"
"Yes, sir, but I'm mainly interested in 
a job."
"Of course," he said, "but life isn't 
that simple . . ."
"But I'm not bothered about all the 
other things, whatever they are,
sir. They're not for me to interfere 
with and I'll be satisfied to go back to
college and remain there as long as 
they'll allow me to."
"But I want to help you do what is 
best," he said. "What's best,
mind you. Do you wish to do what's best 
for yourself?"
"Why, yes, sir. I suppose I do . . ."
"Then forget about returning to the 
college. Go somewhere else . . ."
"You mean leave?"
"Yes, forget it . . ."
"But you said that you would help me!"
"I did and I am --"
"But what about seeing Mr. Emerson?"
"Oh, God! Don't you see that it's best 
that you do not see him?"
Suddenly I could not breathe. Then I 
was standing, gripping my brief
case. "What have you got against me?" I 
blurted. "What did I ever do to
you? You never intended to let me see 
him. Even though I presented my
letter of introduction. Why? Why? I'd 
never endanger your job --"
"No, no, no! Of course not," he cried, 
getting to his feet. "You've
misunderstood

me.

You

mustn't

do

that!

God,

there's

too

much

misunderstanding. Please don't think 
I'm trying to prevent you from seeing
my -- from seeing Mr. Emerson out of 
prejudice . . ."
"Yes, sir, I do," I said angrily. "I 
was sent here by a friend of his.
You read the letter, but still you 
refuse to let me see him, and now you're
trying to get me to leave college. What 
kind of man are you, anyway? What
have you got against me? You, a 
northern white man!"
He looked pained. "I've done it badly," 
he said, "but you must
believe that I am trying to advise you 
what is best for you." He snatched off
his glasses.
"But I know what's best for me," I 
said. "Or at least Dr. Bledsoe
does, and if I can't see Mr. Emerson 
today, just tell me when I can and I'll
be here . . ."

He bit his lips and shut his eyes, 
shaking his head from side to side
as though fighting back a scream. "I'm 
sorry, really sorry that I started all 
of
this," he said, suddenly calm. "It was 
foolish of me to try to advise you, but
please, you mustn't believe that I'm 
against you . . . or your race. I'm your
friend. Some of the finest people I 
know are Neg -- Well, you see, Mr.
Emerson is my father."
"Your father!"
"My father, yes, though I would have 
preferred it otherwise. But he
is, and I could arrange for you to see 
him. But to be utterly frank, I'm
incapable of such cynicism. It would do 
you no good."
"But I'd like to take my chances, Mr. 
Emerson, sir . . . This is very
important to me. My whole career 
depends upon it."
"But you have no chance," he said.
"But Dr. Bledsoe sent me here," I said, 
growing more excited. "I
must have a chance . . ."
"Dr. Bledsoe," he said with distaste. 
"He's like my . . . he ought to
be horsewhipped! Here," he said, 
sweeping up the letter and thrusting it
crackling toward me. I took it, looking 
into his eyes that burned back at me.
"Go on, read it," he cried excitedly. 
"Go on!"
"But I wasn't asking for this," I said.
"Read it!"
My dear Mr. Emerson:
The bearer of this letter is a former 
student of ours (I say former
because he shall never, under any 
circumstances, be enrolled as a student
here again) who has been expelled for a 
most serious defection from our
strictest rules of deportment.
Due, however, to circumstances the 
nature of which I shall explain to
you in person on the occasion of the 
next meeting of the board, it is to the
best interests of the college that this 
young man have no knowledge of the
finality of his expulsion. For it is 
indeed his hope to return here to his
classes in the fall. However, it is to 
the best interests of the great work 
which
we are dedicated to perform, that he 
continue undisturbed in these vain
hopes while remaining as far as 
possible from our midst.

This case represents, my dear Mr. 
Emerson, one of the rare, delicate
instances in which one for whom we held 
great expectations has gone
grievously astray, and who in his fall 
threatens to upset certain delicate
relationships between certain 
interested individuals and the school. 
Thus,
while the bearer is no longer a member 
of our scholastic family, it is highly
important that his severance with the 
college be executed as painlessly as
possible. I beg of you, sir, to help 
him continue in the direction of that
promise which, like the horizon, 
recedes ever brightly and distantly 
beyond
the hopeful traveler.
Respectfully, I am your humble servant,
A. Herbert Bledsoe
I raised my head. Twenty-five years 
seemed to have lapsed between
his handing me the letter and my 
grasping its message. I could not 
believe it,
tried to read it again. I could not 
believe it, yet I had a feeling that it 
all
had happened before. I rubbed my eyes, 
and they felt sandy as though all the
fluids had suddenly dried.
"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm terribly 
sorry."
"What did I do? I always tried to do 
the right thing
"That you must tell me," he said. "To 
what does he refer?"
"I don't know, I don't know . . ."
"But you must have done something."
"I took a man for a drive, showed him 
into the Golden Day to help
him when he became ill ... I don't know
I told him falteringly of the visit to 
Trueblood's and the trip to the
Golden Day and of my expulsion, 
watching his mobile face reflecting his
reaction to each detail.
"It's little enough," he said when I 
had finished. "I don't understand
the man. He is very complicated."
"I only wanted to return and help," I 
said.
"You'll never return. You can't return 
now," he said. "Don't you see?
I'm terribly sorry and yet I'm glad 
that I gave in to the impulse to speak 
to
you. Forget it; though that's advice 
which I've been unable to accept myself,
it's still good advice. There is no 
point in blinding yourself to the 
truth. Don't
blind yourself . . ."

I got up, dazed, and started toward the 
door. He came behind me
into the reception room where the birds 
flamed in the cage, their squawks
like screams in a nightmare.
He stammered guiltily, "Please, I must 
ask you never to mention this
conversation to anyone."
"No," I said.
"I wouldn't mind, but my father would 
consider my revelation the
most extreme treason . . . You're free 
of him now. I'm still his prisoner. You
have been freed, don't you understand? 
I've still my battle." He seemed near
tears.
"I won't," I said. "No one would 
believe me. I can't myself. There
must be some mistake. There must be . . 
."
I opened the door.
"Look, fellow," he said. "This evening 
I'm having a party at the
Calamus. Would you like to join my 
guests? It might help you --"
"No, thank you, sir. I'll be all right."
"Perhaps you'd like to be my valet?"
I looked at him. "No, thank you, sir," 
I said.
"Please," he said. "I really want to 
help. Look, I happen to know of a
possible job at Liberty Paints. My 
father has sent several fellows there . 
. .
You should try --"
I shut the door.
The elevator dropped me like a shot and 
I went out and walked
along the street. The sun was very 
bright now and the people along the walk
seemed far away. I stopped before a 
gray wall where high above me the
headstones of a church graveyard arose 
like the tops of buildings. Across the
street in the shade of an awning a 
shoeshine boy was dancing for pennies. I
went on to the corner and got on a bus 
and went automatically to the rear.
In the seat in front of me a dark man 
in a panama hat kept whistling a tune
between his teeth. My mind, flew in 
circles, to Bledsoe, Emerson and back
again. There was no sense to be made of 
it. It was a joke. Hell, it couldn't
be a joke. Yes, it is a joke . . . 
Suddenly the bus jerked to a stop and I
heard myself humming the same tune that 
the man ahead was whistling, and
the words came back:

O well they picked poor Robin clean
O well they picked poor Robin clean
Well they tied poor Robin to a stump
Lawd, they picked all the feathers 
round from Robin's rump
Well they picked poor Robin clean.
Then I was on my feet, hurrying to the 
door, hearing the thin,
tissue-paper-against-the-teeth-of-a-comb
 whistle following me outside at the
next stop. I stood trembling at the 
curb, watching and half expecting to see
the man leap from the door to follow 
me, whistling the old forgotten jingle
about a bare-rumped robin. My mind 
seized upon the tune. I took the
subway and it still droned through my 
mind after I had reached my room at
Men's

House

and

lay

across

the

bed.

What

was

the

who-what-when-why-where of poor old 
Robin? What had he done and who
had tied him and why had they plucked 
him and why had we sung of his
fate? It was for a laugh, for a laugh, 
all the kids had laughed and laughed,
and the droll tuba player of the old 
Elk's band had rendered it solo on his
helical horn; with comical flourishes 
and doleful phrasing, "Boo boo boo
booooo, Poor Robin clean" -- a mock 
funeral dirge . . . But who was Robin
and for what had he been hurt and 
humiliated?
Suddenly I lay shaking with anger. It 
was no good. I thought of
young Emerson. What if he'd lied out of 
some ulterior motive of his own?
Everyone seemed to have some plan for 
me, and beneath that some more
secret plan. What was young Emerson's 
plan -- and why should it have
included me? Who was I anyway? I tossed 
fitfully. Perhaps it was a test of
my good will and faith -- But that's a 
lie, I thought. It's a lie and you know
it's a lie. I had seen the letter and 
it had practically ordered me killed. By
slow degrees . . .
"My dear Mr. Emerson," I said aloud. 
"The Robin bearing this letter
is a former student. Please hope him to 
death, and keep him running. Your
most humble and obedient servant, A. H. 
Bledsoe . . ."
Sure, that's the way it was, I thought, 
a short, concise verbal coup de
grace, straight to the nape of the 
neck. And Emerson would write in reply?
Sure: "Dear Bled, have met Robin and 
shaved tail. Signed, Emerson."
I sat on the bed and laughed. They'd 
sent me to the rookery, all

right. I laughed and felt numb and 
weak, knowing that soon the pain would
come and that no matter what happened 
to me I'd never be the same. I felt
numb and I was laughing. When I 
stopped, gasping for breath, I decided 
that
I would go back and kill Bledsoe. Yes, 
I thought, I owe it to the race and to
myself. I'll kill him.
And the boldness of the idea and the 
anger behind it made me move
with decision. I had to have a job and 
I took what I hoped was the quickest
means. I called the plant young Emerson 
had mentioned, and it worked. I
was told to report the following 
morning. It happened so quickly and with
such ease that for a moment I felt 
turned around. Had they planned it this
way? But no, they wouldn't catch me 
again. This time I had made the move.
I could hardly get to sleep for 
dreaming of revenge.

Chapter 10
The plant was in Long Island, and I 
crossed a bridge in the fog to
get there and came down in a stream of 
workers. Ahead of me a huge
electric sign announced its message 
through the drifting strands of fog:
KEEP AMERICA PURE
WITH
LIBERTY PAINTS
Flags were fluttering in the breeze 
from each of a maze of buildings
below the sign, and for a moment it was 
like watching some vast patriotic
ceremony from a distance. But no shots 
were fired and no bugles sounded. I
hurried ahead with the others through 
the fog.
I was worried, since I had used 
Emerson's name without his
permission, but when I found my way to 
the personnel office it worked like
magic. I was interviewed by a little 
droopy-eyed man named Mr. MacDuffy
and sent to work for a Mr. Kimbro. An 
office boy came along to direct me.

"If Kimbro needs him," MacDuffy told 
the boy, "come back and have
his name entered on the shipping 
department's payroll."
"It's tremendous," I said as we left 
the building. "It looks like a small
city."
"It's big all right," he said. "We're 
one of the biggest outfits in the
business. Make a lot of paint for the 
government."
We entered one of the buildings now and 
started down a pure white
hall.
"You better leave your things in the 
locker room," he said, opening a
door through which I saw a room with 
low wooden benches and rows of
green lockers. There were keys in 
several of the locks, and he selected 
one
for me. "Put your stuff in there and 
take the key," he said. Dressing, I felt
nervous. He sprawled with one foot on a 
bench, watching me closely as he
chewed on a match stem. Did he suspect 
that Emerson hadn't sent me?
"They have a new racket around here," 
he said, twirling the match
between his finger and thumb. There was 
a note of insinuation in his voice,
and I looked up from tying my shoe, 
breathing with conscious evenness.
"What kind of racket?" I said.
"Oh, you know. The wise guys firing the 
regular guys and putting on
you colored college boys. Pretty 
smart," he said. "That way they don't 
have to
pay union wages."
"How did you know I went to college?" I 
said.
"Oh, there're about six of you guys out 
here already. Some up in the
testing lab. Everybody knows about 
that."
"But I had no idea that was why I was 
hired," I said.
"Forget it, Mac," he said. "It's not 
your fault. You new guys don't
know the score. Just like the union 
says, it's the wise guys in the office.
They're the ones who make scabs out of 
you -- Hey! we better hurry."
We entered a long, shed-like room in 
which I saw a series of
overhead doors along one side and a row 
of small offices on the other. I
followed the boy down an aisle between 
endless cans, buckets and drums
labeled with the company's trademark, a 
screaming eagle. The paint was
stacked in neatly pyramided lots along 
the concrete floor. Then, starting into
one of the offices, the boy stopped 
short and grinned.
"Listen to that!"

Someone inside the office was swearing 
violently over a telephone.
"Who's that?" I asked.
He grinned. "Your boss, the terrible 
Mr. Kimbro. We call him
'Colonel,' but don't let him catch you."
I didn't like it. The voice was raving 
about some failure of the
laboratory and I felt a swift 
uneasiness. I didn't like the idea of 
starting to
work for a man who was in such a nasty 
mood. Perhaps he was angry at one
of the men from the school, and that 
wouldn't make him feel too friendly
toward me.
"Let's go in," the boy said. "I've got 
to get back."
As we entered, the man slammed down the 
phone and picked up
some papers.
"Mr. MacDuffy wants to know if you can 
use this new man," the boy
said.
"You damn right I can use him and . . 
." the voice trailed off, the
eyes above the stiff military mustache 
going hard.
"Well, can you use him?" the boy said. 
"I got to go make out his
card."
"Okay," the man said finally. "I can 
use him. I gotta. What's his
name?"
The boy read my name off a card.
"All right," he said, "you go right to 
work. And you," he said to the
boy, "get the hell out of here before I 
give you a chance to earn some of the
money wasted on you every payday!"
"Aw, gwan, you slave driver," the boy 
said, dashing from the room.
Reddening, Kimbro turned to me, "Come 
along, let's get going."
I followed him into the long room where 
the lots of paint were
stacked along the floor beneath 
numbered markers that hung from the 
ceiling.
Toward the rear I could see two men 
unloading heavy buckets from a truck,
stacking them neatly on a low loading 
platform.
"Now get this straight," Kimbro said 
gruffly. "This is a busy
department and I don't have time to 
repeat things. You have to follow
instructions and you're going to be 
doing things you don't understand, so 
get
your orders the first time and get them 
right! I won't have time to stop and
explain everything. You have to catch 
on by doing exactly what I tell you.

You got that?"
I nodded, noting that his voice became 
louder when the men across
the floor stopped to listen.
"All right," he said, picking up 
several tools. "Now come over here."
"He's Kimbro," one of the men said.
I watched him kneel and open one of the 
buckets, stirring a milky
brown substance. A nauseating stench 
arose. I wanted to step away. But he
stirred it vigorously until it became 
glossy white, holding the spatula like a
delicate instrument and studying the 
paint as it laced off the blade, back 
into
the bucket. Kimbro frowned.
"Damn those laboratory blubberheads to 
hell! There's got to be dope
put in every single sonofabitching 
bucket. And that's what you're going to 
do,
and it's got to be put in so it can be 
trucked out of here before 11:30." He
handed me a white enamel graduate and 
what looked like a battery
hydrometer.
"The idea is to open each bucket and 
put in ten drops of this stuff,"
he said. "Then you stir it 'til it 
disappears. After it's mixed you take 
this
brush and paint out a sample on one of 
these." He produced a number of
small rectangular boards and a small 
brush from his jacket pocket. "You
understand?"
"Yes, sir." But when I looked into the 
white graduate I hesitated; the
liquid inside was dead black. Was he 
trying to kid me?
"What's wrong?"
"I don't know, sir . . . I mean. Well, 
I don't want to start by asking
a lot of stupid questions, but do you 
know what's in this graduate?"
His eyes snapped. "You damn right I 
know," he said. "You just do
what you're told!"
"I just wanted to make sure, sir," I 
said.
"Look," he said, drawing in his breath 
with an exaggerated show of
patience. "Take the dropper and fill it 
full . . . Go on, do it!"
I filled it.
"Now measure ten drops into the paint . 
. . There, that's it, not too
goddam fast. Now. You want no more than 
ten, and no less."
Slowly, I measured the glistening black 
drops, seeing them settle
upon the surface and become blacker 
still, spreading suddenly out to the

edges.
"That's it. That's all you have to do," 
he said. "Never mind how it
looks. That's my worry. You just do 
what you're told and don't try to think
about it. When you've done five or six 
buckets, come back and see if the
samples are dry . . . And hurry, we've 
got to get this batch back off to
Washington by 11:30 . . ."
I worked fast but carefully. With a man 
like this Kimbro the least
thing done incorrectly would cause 
trouble. So I wasn't supposed to think! 
To
hell with him. Just a flunkey, a 
northern redneck, a Yankee cracker! I 
mixed
the paint thoroughly, then brushed it 
smoothly on one of the pieces of board,
careful that the brush strokes were 
uniform.
Struggling to remove an especially 
difficult cover, I wondered if the
same Liberty paint was used on the 
campus, or if this "Optic White" was
something made exclusively for the 
government. Perhaps it was of a better
quality, a special mix. And in my mind 
I could see the brightly trimmed and
freshly decorated campus buildings as 
they appeared on spring mornings -after 
the fall painting and the light winter 
snows, with a cloud riding over
and a darting bird above -- framed by 
the trees and encircling vines. The
buildings had always seemed more 
impressive because they were the only
buildings to receive regular paintings; 
usually, the nearby houses and cabins
were left untouched to become the dull 
grained gray of weathered wood. And
I remembered how the splinters in some 
of the boards were raised from the
grain by the wind, the sun and the rain 
until the clapboards shone with a
satiny, silvery, silver-fish sheen. 
Like Trueblood's cabin, or the Golden 
Day . .
. The Golden Day had once been painted 
white; now its paint was flaking
away with the years, the scratch of a 
finger being enough to send it
showering down. Damn that Golden Day! 
But it was strange how life
connected up; because I had carried Mr. 
Norton to the old rundown building
with rotting paint, I was here. If, I 
thought, one could slow down his
heartbeats and memory to the tempo of 
the black drops falling so slowly into
the bucket yet reacting so swiftly, it 
would seem like a sequence in a feverish
dream . . . I was so deep in reverie 
that I failed to hear Kimbro approach.
"How's it coming?" he said, standing 
with hands on hips.
"All right, sir."
"Let's see," he said, selecting a 
sample and running his thumb across

the board. "That's it, as white as 
George Washington's Sunday-go-to-meetin'
wig and as sound as the all-mighty 
dollar! That's paint!" he said proudly.
"That's paint that'll cover just about 
anything!"
He looked as though I had expressed a 
doubt and I hurried to say,
"It's certainly white all right."
"White! It's the purest white that can 
be found. Nobody makes a
paint any whiter. This batch right here 
is heading for a national monument!"
"I see," I said, quite impressed.
He looked at his watch. "Just keep it 
up," he said. "If I don't hurry
I'll be late for that production 
conference! Say, you're nearly out of 
dope:
you'd better go in the tank room and 
refill it . . . And don't waste any 
time!
I've got to go."
He shot away without telling me where 
the tank room was. It was
easy to find, but I wasn't prepared for 
so many tanks. There were seven;
each with a puzzling code stenciled on 
it. It's just like Kimbro not to tell 
me,
I thought. You can't trust any of them. 
Well, it doesn't matter, I'll pick the
tank from the contents of the drip cans 
hanging from the spigots.
But while the first five tanks 
contained clear liquids that smelled 
like
turpentine, the last two both contained 
something black like the dope, but
with different codes. So I had to make 
a choice. Selecting the tank with the
drip can that smelled most like the 
dope, I filled the graduate, 
congratulating
myself for not having to waste time 
until Kimbro returned.
The work went faster now, the mixing 
easier. The pigment and heavy
oils came free of the bottom much 
quicker, and when Kimbro returned I was
going at top speed. "How many have you 
finished?" he asked.
"About seventy-five, I think, sir. I 
lost count."
"That's pretty good, but not fast 
enough. They've been putting
pressure on me to get the stuff out. 
Here, I'll give you a hand."
They must have given him hell, I 
thought, as he got grunting to his
knees and began removing covers from 
the buckets. But he had hardly started
when he was called away.
When he left I took a look at the last 
bunch of samples and got a
shock: Instead of the smooth, hard 
surface of the first, they were covered
with a sticky goo through which I could 
see the grain of the wood. What on
earth had happened? The paint was not 
as white and glossy as before; it had

a gray tinge. I stirred it vigorously, 
then grabbed a rag, wiping each of the
boards clean, then made a new sample of 
each bucket. I grew panicky lest
Kimbro return before I finished. 
Working feverishly, I made it, but 
since the
paint required a few minutes to dry I 
picked up two finished buckets and
started lugging them over to the 
loading platform. I dropped them with a
thump as the voice rang out behind me. 
It was Kimbro.
"What the hell!" he yelled, smearing 
his finger over one of the
samples. "This stuff's still wet!"
I didn't know what to say. He snatched 
up several of the later
samples, smearing them, and letting out 
a groan. "Of all the things to happen
to me. First they take all my good men 
and then they send me you. What'd
you do to it?"
"Nothing, sir. I followed your 
directions," I said defensively.
I watched him peer into the graduate, 
lifting the dropper and sniffing
it, his face glowing with exasperation.
"Who the hell gave you this?"
"No one . . ."
"Then where'd you get it?"
"From the tank room."
Suddenly he dashed for the tank room, 
sloshing the liquid as he ran.
I thought, Oh, hell, and before I could 
follow, he burst out of the door in a
frenzy.
"You took the wrong tank," he shouted. 
"What the hell, you trying to
sabotage the company? That stuff 
wouldn't work in a million years. It's
remover, concentrated remover! Don't 
you know the difference?"
"No, sir, I don't. It looked the same 
to me. I didn't know what I was
using and you didn't tell me. I was 
trying to save time and took what I
thought was right."
"But why this one?"
"Because it smelled the same --" I 
began.
"Smelted!" he roared. "Goddamit, don't 
you know you can't smell shit
around all those fumes? Come on to my 
office!"
I was torn between protesting and 
pleading for fairness. It was not
all my fault and I didn't want the 
blame, but I did wish to finish out the
day. Throbbing with anger I followed, 
listening as he called personnel.

"Hello? Mac? Mac, this is Kimbro. It's 
about this fellow you sent me
this morning. I'm sending him in to 
pick up his pay . . . What did he do?
He doesn't satisfy me, that's what. I 
don't like his work . . . So the old man
has to have a report, so what? Make him 
one. Tell him goddamit this fellow
ruined a batch of government stuff -- 
Hey! No, don't tell him that . . .
Listen, Mac, you got anyone else out 
there? . . . Okay, forget it."
He crashed down the phone and swung 
toward me. "I swear I don't
know why they hire you fellows. You 
just don't belong in a paint plant. Come
on."
Bewildered, I followed him into the 
tank room, yearning to quit and
tell him to go to hell. But I needed 
the money, and even though this was the
North I wasn't ready to fight unless I 
had to. Here I'd be one against how
many?
I watched him empty the graduate back 
into the tank and noted
carefully when he went to another 
marked SKA-3-69-T-Y and refilled it. 
Next
time I would know.
"Now, for God's sake," he said, handing 
me the graduate, "be careful
and try to do the job right. And if you 
don't know what to do, ask
somebody. I'll be in my office."
I returned to the buckets, my emotions 
whirling. Kimbro had
forgotten to say what was to be done 
with the spoiled paint. Seeing it there 
I
was suddenly seized by an angry 
impulse, and, filling the dropper with 
fresh
dope, I stirred ten drops into each 
bucket and pressed home the covers. Let
the government worry about that, I 
thought, and started to work on the
unopened buckets. I stirred until my 
arm ached and painted the samples as
smoothly as I could, becoming more 
skillful as I went along.
When Kimbro came down the floor and 
watched I glanced up silently
and continued stirring.
"How is it?" he said, frowning.
"I don't know," I said, picking up a 
sample and hesitating.
"Well?"
"It's nothing . . . a speck of dirt," I 
said, standing and holding out
the sample, a tightness growing within 
me.
Holding it close to his face, he ran 
his fingers over the surface and
squinted at the texture. "That's more 
like it," he said. "That's the way it

oughta be."
I watched with a sense of unbelief as 
he rubbed his thumb over the
sample, handed it back and left without 
a further word.
I looked at the painted slab. It 
appeared the same: a gray tinge
glowed through the whiteness, and 
Kimbro had failed to detect it. I 
stared for
about a minute, wondering if I were 
seeing things, inspected another and
another. All were the same, a brilliant 
white diffused with gray, I closed my
eyes for a moment and looked again and 
still no change. Well, I thought, as
long as he's satisfied . . .
But I had a feeling that something had 
gone wrong, something far
more important than the paint; that 
either I had played a trick on Kimbro or
he, like the trustees and Bledsoe, was 
playing one on me . . .
When the truck backed up to the 
platform I was pressing the cover
on the last bucket -- and there stood 
Kimbro above me.
"Let's see your samples," he said.
I reached, trying to select the 
whitest, as the blue-shirted truckmen
climbed through the loading door.
"How about it, Kimbro," one of them 
said, "can we get started?"
"Just a minute, now," he said, studying 
the sample, "just a minute . .
."
I watched him nervously, waiting for 
him to throw a fit over the gray
tinge and hating myself for feeling 
nervous and afraid. What would I say?
But now he was turning to the truckmen.
"All right, boys, get the hell out of 
here.
"And you," he said to me, "go see 
MacDuffy; you're through."
I stood there, staring at the back of 
his head, at the pink neck
beneath the cloth cap and the iron-gray 
hair. So he'd let me stay only to
finish the mixing. I turned away, there 
was nothing that I could do. I cursed
him all the way to the personnel 
office. Should I write the owners about
what had happened? Perhaps they didn't 
know that Kimbro was having so
much to do with the quality of the 
paint. But upon reaching the office I
changed my mind. Perhaps that is how 
things are done here, I thought,
perhaps the real quality of the paint 
is always determined by the man who
ships it rather than by those who mix 
it. To hell with the whole thing . . .
I'll find another job.

But I wasn't fired. MacDuffy sent me to 
the basement of Building
No. 2 on a new assignment.
"When you get down there just tell 
Brockway that Mr. Sparland
insists that he have an assistant. You 
do whatever he tells you."
"What is that name again, sir?" I said.
"Lucius Brockway," he said. "He's in 
charge."

IT WAS a deep basement. Three levels 
underground I pushed upon a
heavy metal door marked "Danger" and 
descended into a noisy, dimly lit
room. There was something familiar 
about the fumes that filled the air and 
I
had just thought pine, when a 
high-pitched Negro voice rang out above 
the
machine sounds.
"Who you looking for down here?"
"I'm looking for the man in charge," I 
called, straining to locate the
voice.
"You talkin' to him. What you want?"
The man who moved out of the shadow and 
looked at me sullenly
was small, wiry and very natty in his 
dirty overalls. And as I approached him
I saw his drawn face and the cottony 
white hair showing beneath his tight,
striped engineer's cap. His manner 
puzzled me. I couldn't tell whether he 
felt
guilty about something himself, or 
thought I had committed some crime. I
came closer, staring. He was barely 
five feet tall, his overalls looking 
now as
though he had been dipped in pitch.
"All right," he said. "I'm a busy man. 
What you want?"
"I'm looking for Lucius," I said.
He frowned. "That's me -- and don't 
come calling me by my first
name. To you and all like you I'm 
Mister Brockway . . ."
"You . . . ?" I began.
"Yeah, me! Who sent you down here 
anyway?"
"The personnel office," I said. "I was 
told to tell you that Mr.
Sparland said for you to be given an 
assistant."
"Assistant!" he said. "I don't need no 
damn assistant! Old Man
Sparland must think I'm getting old as 
him. Here I been running things by
myself all these years and now they 
keep trying to send me some assistant.

You get on back up there and tell 'em 
that when I want an assistant I'll ask
for one!"
I was so disgusted to find such a man 
in charge that I turned
without a word and started back up the 
stairs. First Kimbro, I thought, and
now this old . . .
"Hey! wait a minute!"
I turned, seeing him beckon.
"Come on back here a minute," he 
called, his voice cutting sharply
through the roar of the furnaces.
I went back, seeing him remove a white 
cloth from his hip pocket
and wipe the glass face of a pressure 
gauge, then bend close to squint at the
position of the needle.
"Here," he said, straightening and 
handing me the cloth, "you can
stay 'til I can get in touch with the 
Old Man. These here have to be kept
clean so's I can see how much pressure 
I'm getting."
I took the cloth without a word and 
began rubbing the glasses. He
watched me critically.
"What's your name?" he said.
I told him, shouting it in the roar of 
the furnaces.
"Wait a minute," he called, going over 
and turning a valve in an
intricate network of pipes. I heard the 
noise rise to a higher, almost
hysterical pitch, somehow making it 
possible to hear without yelling, our
voices moving blurrily underneath.
Returning, he looked at me sharply, his 
withered face an animated
black walnut with shrewd, reddish eyes.
"This here's the first time they ever 
sent me anybody like you," he
said as though puzzled. "That's how 
come I called you back. Usually they
sends down some young white fellow who 
thinks he's going to watch me a
few days and ask me a heap of questions 
and then take over. Some folks is
too damn simple to even talk about," he 
said, grimacing and waving his hand
in a violent gesture of dismissal. "You 
an engineer?" he said, looking quickly
at me.
"An engineer?"
"Yeah, that's what I asked you," he 
said challengingly.
"Why, no, sir, I'm no engineer."

"You sho?"
"Of course I'm sure. Why shouldn't I 
be?"
He seemed to relax. "That's all right 
then. I have to watch them
personnel fellows. One of them thinks 
he's going to git me out of here, when
he ought to know by now he's wasting 
his time. Lucius Brockway not only
intends to protect hisself, he knows 
how to do it! Everybody knows I been
here ever since there's been a here -- 
even helped dig the first foundation.
The Old Man hired me, nobody else; and, 
by God, it'll take the Old Man to
fire me!"
I rubbed away at the gauges, wondering 
what had brought on this
outburst, and was somewhat relieved 
that he seemed to hold nothing against
me personally.
"Where you go to school?" he said.
I told him.
"Is that so? What you learning down 
there?"
"Just general subjects, a regular 
college course," I said.
"Mechanics?"
"Oh no, nothing like that, just a 
liberal arts course. No trades."
"Is that so?" he said doubtfully. Then 
suddenly, "How much pressure
I got on that gauge right there?"
"Which?"
"You see it," he pointed. "That one 
right there!"
I looked, calling off, "Forty-three and 
two-tenths pounds."
"Uh huh, uh huh, that's right." He 
squinted at the gauge and back at
me. "Where you learn to read a gauge so 
good?"
"In my high-school physics class. It's 
like reading a clock."
"They teach you that in high school?"
"That's right."
"Well, that's going to be one of your 
jobs. These here gauges have to
be checked every fifteen minutes. You 
ought to be able to do that."
"I think I can," I said.
"Some kin, some caint. By the way, who 
hired you?"
"Mr. MacDuffy," I said, wondering why 
all the questions.
"Yeah, then where you been all morning?"
"I was working over in Building No. 1."

"That there's a heap of building. Where 
'bouts?"
"For Mr. Kimbro."
"I see, I see. I knowed they oughtn't 
to be hiring anybody this late
in the day. What Kimbro have you doing?"
"Putting dope in some paint that went 
bad," I said wearily, annoyed
with all the questions.
His lips shot out belligerently. "What 
paint went bad?"
"I think it was some for the government 
. . ."
He cocked his head. "I wonder how come 
nobody said nothing to me
about it," he said thoughtfully. "Was 
it in buckets or them little biddy 
cans?"
"Buckets."
"Oh, that ain't so bad, them little 
ones is a heap of work." He gave
me a high dry laugh. "How you hear 
about this job?" he snapped suddenly,
as though trying to catch me off guard.
"Look," I said slowly, "a man I know 
told me about the job;
MacDuffy hired me; I worked this 
morning for Mr. Kimbro; and I was sent
to you by Mr. MacDuffy."
His face tightened. "You friends to one 
of those colored fellows?"
"Who?"
"Up in the lab?"
"No," I said. "Anything else you want 
to know?"
He gave me a long, suspicious look and 
spat upon a hot pipe,
causing it to steam furiously. I 
watched him remove a heavy engineer's 
watch
from his breast pocket and squint at 
the dial importantly, then turn to check
it with an electric clock that glowed 
from the wall. "You keep on wiping them
gauges," he said. "I got to look at my 
soup. And look here." He pointed to
one of the gauges. "I wants you to keep 
a 'specially sharp eye on this here
sonofabitch. The last couple of days 
he's 'veloped a habit of building up too
fast. Causes me a heap of trouble. You 
see him gitting past 75, you yell, and
yell loud!"
He went back into the shadows and I saw 
a shaft of brightness mark
the opening of a door.
Running the rag over a gauge I wondered 
how an apparently
uneducated old man could gain such a 
responsible job. He certainly didn't
sound like an engineer; yet he alone 
was on duty. And you could never be

sure, for at home an old man employed 
as a janitor at the Water Works was
the only one who knew the location of 
all of the water mains. He had been
employed at the beginning, before any 
records were kept, and actually
functioned as an engineer though he 
drew a janitor's pay. Perhaps this old
Brockway

was

protecting himself

from something. After all,

there

was

antagonism to our being employed. Maybe 
he was dissimulating, like some of
the teachers at the college, who, to 
avoid trouble when driving through the
small surrounding towns, wore chauffeur 
caps and pretended that their cars
belonged to white men. But why was he 
pretending with me? And what was
his job?
I looked around me. It was not just an 
engine room; I knew, for I
had been in several, the last at 
college. It was something more. For one
thing, the furnaces were made 
differently and the flames that flared 
through
the cracks of the fire chambers were 
too intense and too blue. And there
were the odors. No, he was making 
something down here, something that had
to do with paint, and probably 
something too filthy and dangerous for 
white
men to be willing to do even for money. 
It was not paint because I had been
told that the paint was made on the 
floors above, where, passing through, I
had seen men in splattered aprons 
working over large vats filled with 
whirling
pigment. One thing was certain: I had 
to be careful with this crazy Brockway;
he didn't like my being here . . . And 
there he was, entering the room now
from the stairs.
"How's it going?" he asked.
"All right," I said. "Only it seems to 
have gotten louder."
"Oh, it gets pretty loud down here, all 
right; this here's the uproar
department and I'm in charge . . . Did 
she go over the mark?"
"No, it's holding steady," I said.
"That's good. I been having plenty 
trouble with it lately. Haveta bust
it down and give it a good going over 
soon as I can get the tank clear."
Perhaps he is the engineer, I thought, 
watching him inspect the
gauges and go to another part of the 
room to adjust a series of valves. Then
he went and said a few words into a 
wall phone and called me, pointing to
the valves.
"I'm fixing to shoot it to 'em 
upstairs," he said gravely. "When I give
you the signal I want you to turn 'em 
wide open. 'N when I give you the

second signal I want you to close 'em 
up again. Start with this here red one
and work right straight across . . ."
I took my position and waited, as he 
took a stand near the gauge.
"Let her go," he called. I opened the 
valves, hearing the sound of
liquids rushing through the huge pipes. 
At the sound of a buzzer I looked up
. . .
"Start closing," he yelled. "What you 
looking at? Close them valves!
"What's wrong with you?" he asked when 
the last valve was closed.
"I expected you to call."
"I said I'd signal you. Caint you tell 
the difference between a signal
and a call? Hell, I buzzed you. You 
don't want to do that no more. When I
buzz you I want you to do something and 
do it quick!"
"You're the boss," I said sarcastically.
"You mighty right, I'm the boss, and 
don't forgit it. Now come on
back here, we got work to do."
We came to a strange-looking machine 
consisting of a huge set of
gears connecting a series of drum-like 
rollers. Brockway took a shovel and
scooped up a load of brown crystals 
from a pile on the floor, pitching them
skillfully into a receptacle on top of 
the machine.
"Grab a scoop and let's git going," he 
ordered briskly. "You ever done
this before?" he asked as I scooped 
into the pile.
"It's been a long time," I said. "What 
is this material?"
He stopped shoveling and gave me a 
long, black stare, then returned
to the pile, his scoop ringing on the 
floor. You'll have to remember not to
ask this suspicious old bastard any 
questions, I thought, scooping into the
brown pile.
Soon I was perspiring freely. My hands 
were sore and I began to
tire. Brockway watched me out of the 
corner of his eye, snickering 
noiselessly.
"You don't want to overwork yourself, 
young feller," he said blandly.
"I'll get used to it," I said, scooping 
up a heavy load.
"Oh, sho, sho," he said. "Sho. But you 
better take a rest when you
git tired."
I didn't stop. I piled on the material 
until he said, "That there's the
scoop we been trying to find. That's 
what we want. You better stand back a
little, 'cause I'm fixing to start her 
up."

I backed away, watching him go over and 
push a switch. Shuddering
into motion, the machine gave a sudden 
scream like a circular saw, and sent
a tattoo of sharp crystals against my 
face. I moved clumsily away, seeing
Brockway grin like a dried prune. Then 
with the dying hum of the furiously
whirling drums, I heard the grains 
sifting lazily in the sudden stillness, 
sliding
sand-like down the chute into the pot 
underneath.
I watched him go over and open a valve. 
A sharp new smell of oil
arose.
"Now she's all set to cook down; all we 
got to do is put the fire to
her," he said, pressing a button on 
something that looked like the burner of
an oil furnace. There was an angry hum, 
followed by a slight explosion that
caused something to rattle, and I could 
hear a low roaring begin.
"Know what that's going to be when it's 
cooked?"
"No, sir," I said.

.

"Well that's going to be the guts, what 
they call the vee-hicle of the
paint. Least it will be by time I git 
through putting other stuff with it."
"But I thought the paint was made 
upstairs . . ."
"Naw, they just mixes in the color, 
make it look pretty. Right down
here is where the real paint is made. 
Without what I do they couldn't do
nothing, they be making bricks without 
straw. An' not only do I make up the
base, I fixes the varnishes and lots of 
the oils too . . ."
"So that's it," I said. "I was 
wondering what you did down here."
"A whole lots of folks wonders about 
that without gitting anywhere.
But as I was saying, caint a single 
doggone drop of paint move out of the
factory lessen it comes through Lucius 
Brockway's hands."
"How long have you been doing this?"
"Long enough to know what I'm doing," 
he said. "And I learned it
without all that education that them 
what's been sent down here is suppose
to have. I learned it by doing it. Them 
personnel fellows don't want to face
the facts, but Liberty Paints wouldn't 
be worth a plugged nickel if they didn't
have me here to see that it got a good 
strong base. Old Man Sparland know
it though. I caint stop laughing over 
the time when I was down with a touch
of pneumonia and they put one of them 
so-called engineers to pooling around
down here. Why, they started to having 
so much paint go bad they didn't
know what to do. Paint was bleeding and 
wrinkling, wouldn't cover or

nothing -- you know, a man could make 
hisself all kinds of money if he
found out what makes paint bleed. 
Anyway, everything was going bad. Then
word got to me that they done put that 
fellow in my place and when I got
well I wouldn't come back. Here I been 
with 'em so long and loyal and
everything. Shucks, I just sent 'em 
word that Lucius Brockway was retiring!
"Next thing you know here come the Old 
Man. He so old hisself his
chauffeur has to help him up them steep 
stairs at my place. Come in
a-puffing and a-blowing, says, 'Lucius, 
what's this I hear 'bout you retiring?'
" 'Well, sir, Mr. Sparland, sir,' I 
says, 'I been pretty sick, as you well
know, and I'm gitting kinder along in 
my years, as you well know, and I
hear that this here Italian fellow you 
got in my place is doing so good I
thought I'd might as well take it easy 
round the house.'
"Why, you'd a-thought I'd done cursed 
him or something. 'What kind
of talk is that from you, Lucius 
Brockway,' he said, 'taking it easy 
round the
house when we need you out to the 
plant? Don't you know the quickest way
to die is to retire? Why, that fellow 
out at the plant don't know a thing
about those furnaces. I'm so worried 
about what he's going to do, that he's
liable to blow up the plant or 
something that I took out some extra
insurance. He can't do your job,' he 
said. 'He don't have the touch. We
haven't put out a first-class batch of 
paint since you been gone.' Now that
was the Old Man hisself!" Lucius 
Brockway said.
"So what happened?" I said.
"What you mean, what happened?" he 
said, looking as though it were
the most unreasonable question in the 
world. "Shucks, a few days later the
Old Man had me back down here in full 
control. That engineer got so mad
when he found out he had to take orders 
from me he quit the next day."
He spat on the floor and laughed. "Heh, 
heh, heh, he was a fool,
that's what. A fool! He wanted to boss 
me and I know more about this
basement than anybody, boilers and 
everything. I helped lay the pipes and
everything, and what I mean is I knows 
the location of each and every pipe
and switch and cable and wire and 
everything else -- both in the floors 
and
in the walls and out in the yard. Yes, 
sir! And what's more, I got it in my
head so good I can trace it out on 
paper down to the last nut and bolt; and
ain't never been to nobody's 
engineering school neither, ain't even 
passed by
one, as far as I know. Now what you 
think about that?"

"I think it's remarkable," I said, 
thinking, I don't like this old man.
"Oh, I wouldn't call it that," he said. 
"It's just that I been round here
so long. I been studying this machinery 
for over twenty-five years. Sho, and
that fellow thinking 'cause he been to 
some school and learned how to read a
blueprint and how to fire a boiler he 
knows more 'bout this plant than
Lucius Brockway. That fool couldn't 
make no engineer 'cause he can't see
what's staring him straight in the face 
. . . Say, you forgittin' to watch them
gauges."
I hurried over, finding all the needles 
steady.
"They're okay," I called.
"All right, but I'm warning you to keep 
an eye on 'em. You caint
forgit down here, 'cause if you do, you 
liable to blow up something. They got
all this machinery, but that ain't 
everything; we are the machines inside 
the
machine.
"You know the best selling paint we 
got, the one that made this here
business?" he asked as I helped him 
fill a vat with a smelly substance.
"No, I don't."
"Our white, Optic White."
"Why the white rather than the others?"
" 'Cause we started stressing it from 
the first. We make the best
white paint in the world, I don't give 
a damn what nobody says. Our white is
so white you can paint a chunka coal 
and you'd have to crack it open with a
sledge hammer to prove it wasn't white 
clear through!"
His eyes glinted with humorless 
conviction and I had to drop my
head to hide my grin.
"You notice that sign on top of the 
building?"
"Oh, you can't miss that," I said.
"You read the slogan?"
"I don't remember, I was in such a 
hurry."
"Well, you might not believe it, but I 
helped the Old Man make up
that slogan. 'If It's Optic White, It's 
the Right White,' " he quoted with an
upraised

finger,

like

a

preacher

quoting

holy

writ.

"I

got

me

a

three-hundred-dollar bonus for helping 
to think that up. These newfangled
advertising folks is been tryin' to 
work up something about the other 
colors,
talking about rainbows or something, 
but hell, they caint get nowhere."

" 'If It's Optic White, It's the Right 
White,'" I repeated and suddenly
had to repress a laugh as a childhood 
jingle rang through my mind:
" 'If you're white, you're right,' " I 
said.
"That's it," he said. "And that's 
another reason why the Old Man
ain't goin' to let nobody come down 
here messing with me. He knows what a
lot of them new fellers don't; he knows 
that the reason our paint is so good
is because of the way Lucius Brockway 
puts the pressure on them oils and
resins before they even leaves the 
tanks." He laughed maliciously. "They
thinks 'cause everything down here is 
done by machinery, that's all there is 
to
it. They crazy! Ain't a continental 
thing that happens down here that ain't 
as
iffen I done put my black hands into 
it! Them machines just do the cooking,
these here hands right here do the 
sweeting. Yes, sir! Lucius Brockway hit 
it
square on the head! I dips my fingers 
in and sweets it! Come on, let's eat . .
."
"But what about the gauges?" I said, 
seeing him go over and take a
thermos bottle from a shelf near one of 
the furnaces.
"Oh, we'll be here close enough to keep 
an eye on 'em. Don't you
worry 'bout that."
"But I left my lunch in the locker room 
over at Building No. 1."
"Go on and git it and come back here 
and eat. Down here we have
to always be on the job. A man don't 
need no more'n fifteen minutes to eat
no-how; then I say let him git on back 
on the job."

UpON opening the door I thought I had 
made a mistake. Men
dressed in splattered painters' caps 
and overalls sat about on benches,
listening to a thin tubercular-looking 
man who was addressing them in a
nasal voice. Everyone looked at me and 
I was starting out when the thin man
called, "There's plenty of seats for 
late comers. Come in, brother . . ."
Brother? Even after my weeks in the 
North this was surprising. "I
was looking for the locker room," I 
spluttered.
"You're in it, brother. Weren't you 
told about the meeting?"
"Meeting? Why, no, sir, I wasn't."
The chairman frowned. "You see, the 
bosses are not co-operating," he
said to the others. "Brother, who's 
your foreman?"

"Mr. Brockway, sir," I said.
Suddenly the men began scraping their 
feet and cursing. I looked
about me. What was wrong? Were they 
objecting to my referring to Brockway
as Mister?
"Quiet, brothers," the chairman said, 
leaning across his table, his
hand cupped to his ear. "Now what was 
that, brother; who is your foreman?"
"Lucius Brockway, sir," I said, 
dropping the Mister.
But this seemed only to make them more 
hostile. "Get him the hell
out of here," they shouted. I turned. A 
group on the far side of the room
kicked over a bench, yelling, "Throw 
him out! Throw him out!"
I inched backwards, hearing the little 
man bang on the table for
order. "Men, brothers! Give the brother 
a chance . . ."
"He looks like a dirty fink to me. A 
first-class enameled fink!"
The hoarsely voiced word grated my ears 
like "nigger" in an angry
southern mouth . . .
"Brothers, please!" The chairman was 
waving his hands as I reached
out behind me for the door and touched 
an arm, feeling it snatch violently
away. I dropped my hand.
"Who sent this fink into the meeting, 
brother chairman? Ask him
that!" a man demanded.
"No, wait," the chairman said. "Don't 
ride that word too hard . . ."
"Ask him, brother chairman!" another 
man said.
"Okay, but don't label a man a fink 
until you know for sure." The
chairman turned to me. "How'd you 
happen in here, brother?"
The men quieted, listening.
"I left my lunch in my locker," I said, 
my mouth dry.
"You weren't sent into the meeting?"
"No, sir, I didn't know about any 
meeting."
"The hell he says. None of these finks 
ever knows!"
"Throw the lousy bastard out!"
"Now, wait," I said.
They became louder, threatening.
"Respect the chair!" the chairman 
shouted. "We're a democratic union
here, following democratic --"
"Never mind, git rid of the fink!"

". . . procedures. It's our task to 
make friends with all the workers.
And I mean all. That's how we build the 
union strong. Now let's hear what
the brother's got to say. No more of 
that beefing and interrupting!"
I broke into a cold sweat, my eyes 
seeming to have become
extremely sharp, causing each face to 
stand out vivid in its hostility.
I heard, "When were you hired, friend?"
"This morning," I said.
"See, brothers, he's a new man. We 
don't want to make the mistake
of

judging

the

worker

by

his

foreman.

Some

of

you

also

work

for

sonsabitches, remember?"
Suddenly the men began to laugh and 
curse. "Here's one right here,"
one of them yelled.
"Mine wants to marry the boss's 
daughter -- a frigging eight-day
wonder!"
This sudden change made me puzzled and 
angry, as though they
were making me the butt of a joke.
"Order, brothers! Perhaps the brother 
would like to join the union.
How about it, brother?"
"Sir . . . ?" I didn't know what to 
say. I knew very little about
unions -- but most of these men seemed 
hostile . . . And before I could
answer a fat man with shaggy gray hair 
leaped to his feet, shouting angrily,
"I'm against it! Brothers, this fellow 
could be a fink, even if he was
hired right this minute! Not that I aim 
to be unfair to anybody, either.
Maybe he ain't a fink," he cried 
passionately, "but brothers, I want to 
remind
you that nobody knows it; and it seems 
to me that anybody that would work
under that sonofabitching, 
double-crossing Brockway for more than 
fifteen
minutes is just as apt as not to be 
naturally fink-minded! Please, 
brothers!"
he cried, waving his arms for quiet. 
"As some of you brothers have learned,
to the sorrow of your wives and babies, 
a fink don't have to know about
trade unionism to be a fink! Finkism? 
Hell, I've made a study of finkism!
Finkism is born into some guys. It's 
born into some guys, just like a good
eye for color is born into other guys. 
That's right, that's the honest, 
scientific
truth! A fink don't even have to have 
heard of a union before," he cried in a
frenzy of words. "All you have to do is 
bring him around the neighborhood
of a union and next thing you know, 
why, zip! he's finking his finking ass

off!"
He was drowned out by shouts of 
approval. Men turned violently to
look at me. I felt choked. I wanted to 
drop my head but faced them as
though facing them was itself a denial 
of his statements. Another voice ripped
out of the shouts of approval, spilling 
with great urgency from the lips of a
little fellow with glasses who spoke 
with the index finger of one hand
upraised and the thumb of the other 
crooked in the suspender of his 
overalls:
"I want to put this brother's remarks 
in the form of a motion: I
move that we determine through a 
thorough investigation whether the new
worker is a fink or no; and if he is a 
fink, let us discover who he's finking
for! And this, brother members, would 
give the worker time, if he ain't a
fink, to become acquainted with the 
work of the union and its aims. After 
all,
brothers, we don't want to forget that 
workers like him aren't so highly
developed as some of us who've been in 
the labor movement for a long time.
So I says, let's give him time to see 
what we've done to improve the
condition of the workers, and then, if 
he ain't a fink, we can decide in a
democratic way whether we want to 
accept this brother into the union.
Brother union members, I thank you!" He 
sat down with a bump.
The room roared. Biting anger grew 
inside me. So I was not so
highly developed as they! What did he 
mean? Were they all Ph.D.'s? I
couldn't move; too much was happening 
to me. It was as though by entering
the room I had automatically applied 
for membership -- even though I had
no idea that a union existed, and had 
come up simply to get a cold pork
chop sandwich. I stood trembling, 
afraid that they would ask me to join 
but
angry that so many rejected me on 
sight. And worst of all, I knew they 
were
forcing me to accept things on their 
own terms, and I was unable to leave.
"All right, brothers. We'll take a 
vote," the chairman shouted. "All in
favor of the motion, signify by saying 
'Aye' . . ."
The ayes drowned him out.
"The ayes carried it," the chairman 
announced as several men turned
to stare at me. At last I could move. I 
started out, forgetting why I had
come.
"Come in, brother," the chairman 
called. "You can get your lunch
now. Let him through, you brothers 
around the door!"
My face stung as though it had been 
slapped. They had made their

decision without giving me a chance to 
speak for myself. I felt that every
man present looked upon me with 
hostility; and though I had lived with
hostility all my life, now for the 
first time it seemed to reach me, as 
though
I had expected more of these men than 
of others -- even though I had not
known of their existence. Here in this 
room my defenses were negated,
stripped away, checked at the door as 
the weapons, the knives and razors and
owlhead pistols of the country boys 
were checked on Saturday night at the
Golden Day. I kept my eyes lowered, 
mumbling "Pardon me, pardon me," all
the way to the drab green locker, where 
I removed the sandwich, for which I
no longer had an appetite, and stood 
fumbling with the bag, dreading to face
the men on my way out. Then still 
hating myself for the apologies made
coming over, I brushed past silently as 
I went back.
When I reached the door the chairman 
called, "Just a minute,
brother, we want you to understand that 
this is nothing against you
personally. What you see here is the 
results of certain conditions here at 
the
plant. We want you to know that we are 
only trying to protect ourselves.
Some day we hope to have you as a 
member in good standing."
From here and there came a half-hearted 
applause that quickly died.
I swallowed and stared unseeing, the 
words spurting to me from a red, misty
distance.
"Okay, brothers," the voice said, "let 
him pass."

I STUMBLED through the bright sunlight 
of the yard, past the office
workers chatting on the grass, back to 
Building No. 2, to the basement. I
stood on the stairs, feeling as though 
my bowels had been flooded with acid.
Why hadn't I simply left, I thought 
with anguish. And since I had
remained, why hadn't I said something, 
defended myself? Suddenly I snatched
the wrapper off a sandwich and tore it 
violently with my teeth, hardly tasting
the dry lumps that squeezed past my 
constricted throat when I swallowed.
Dropping the remainder back into the 
bag, I held onto the handrail, my legs
shaking as though I had just escaped a 
great danger. Finally, it went away
and I pushed open the metal door.
"What kept you so long?" Brockway 
snapped from where he sat on a
wheelbarrow. He had been drinking from 
a white mug now cupped in his

grimy hands.
I looked at him abstractedly, seeing 
how the light caught on his
wrinkled forehead, his snowy hair. "I 
said, what kept you so long!" What had
he to do with it, I thought, looking at 
him through a kind of mist, knowing
that I disliked him and that I was very 
tired.
"I say . . ." he began, and I heard my 
voice come quiet from my
tensed throat as I noticed by the clock 
that I had been gone only twenty
minutes. "I ran into a union meeting --"
"Union!" I heard his white cup shatter 
against the floor as he
uncrossed his legs, rising. "I knowed 
you belonged to that bunch of
troublemaking foreigners! I knowed it! 
Git out!" he screamed. "Git out of my
basement!"
He started toward me as in a dream, 
trembling like the needle of
one of the gauges as he pointed toward 
the stairs, his voice shrieking. I
stared; something seemed to have gone 
wrong, my reflexes were jammed.
"But what's the matter?" I stammered, 
my voice low and my mind
understanding and yet failing exactly 
to understand. "What's wrong?"
"You heard me. Git out!"
"But I don't understand . . ."
"Shut up and git!"
"But, Mr. Brockway," I cried, fighting 
to hold something that was
giving way.
"You two-bit, trouble-making union 
louse!"
"Look, man," I cried, urgently now, "I 
don't belong to any union."
"If you don't git outta here, you 
low-down skunk," he said, looking
wildly about the floor, "I'm liable to 
kill you. The Lord being my witness,
I'LL KILL YOU!"
It was incredible, things were speeding 
up. "You'll do what?" I
stammered.
"I'LL KILL YOU, THAT'S WHAT!"
He had said it again and something fell 
away from me, and I
seemed to be telling myself in a rush: 
You were trained to accept the
foolishness of such old men as this, 
even when you thought them clowns and
fools; you were trained to pretend that 
you respected them and acknowledged
in them the same quality of authority 
and power in your world as the whites

before whom they bowed and scraped and 
feared and loved and imitated, and
you were even trained to accept it 
when, angered or spiteful, or drunk with
power, they came at you with a stick or 
strap or cane and you made no
effort to strike back, but only to 
escape unmarked. But this was too much 
. .
. he was not grandfather or uncle or 
father, nor preacher or teacher.
Something uncoiled in my stomach and I 
was moving toward him, shouting,
more at a black blur that irritated my 
eyes than at a clearly denned human
face, "YOU'LL KILL WHO?"
"YOU, THAT'S WHO!"
"Listen here, you old fool, don't talk 
about killing me! Give me a
chance to explain. I don't belong to 
anything -- Go on, pick it up! Go on!" I
yelled, seeing his eyes fasten upon a 
twisted iron bar. "You're old enough to
be my grandfather, but if you touch 
that bar, I swear I'll make you eat it!"
"I done tole you, GIT OUTTA MY 
BASEMENT! You impudent
son'bitch," he screamed.
I moved forward, seeing him stoop and 
reach aside for the bar; and
I was throwing myself forward, feeling 
him go over with a grunt, hard against
the floor, rolling beneath the force of 
my lunge. It was as though I had
landed upon a wiry rat. He scrambled 
beneath me, making angry sounds and
striking my face as he tried to use the 
bar. I twisted it from his grasp,
feeling a sharp pain stab through my 
shoulder. He's using a knife flashed
through my mind and I slashed out with 
my elbow, sharp against his face,
feeling it land solid and seeing his 
head fly backwards and up and back again
as I struck again, hearing something 
fly free and skitter across the floor,
thinking, It's gone, the knife is gone 
. . . and struck again as he tried to
choke me, jabbing at his bobbing head, 
feeling the bar come free and
bringing it down at his head, missing, 
the metal clinking against the floor,
and bringing it up for a second try and 
him yelling, "No, no! You the best,
you the best!"
"I'm going to beat your brains out!" I 
said, my throat dry, "stabbing
me . . ."
"No," he panted. "I got enough. Ain't 
you heard me say I got
enough?"
"So when you can't win you want to 
stop! Damn you, if you've cut
me bad, I'll tear your head off!"

Watching him warily, I got to my feet. 
I dropped the bar, as a flash
of heat swept over me: His face was 
caved in.
"What's wrong with you, old man?" I 
yelled nervously. "Don't you
know better than to attack a man a 
third your age?"
He blanched at being called old, and I 
repeated it, adding insults I'd
heard

my

grandfather

use.

"Why,

you

old-fashioned,

slavery-time,

mammy-made, handkerchief-headed 
bastard, you should know better! What
made you think you could threaten my 
life? You meant nothing to me, I
came down here because I was sent. I 
didn't know anything about you or the
union either. Why'd you start riding me 
the minute I came in? Are you
people crazy? Does this paint go to 
your head? Are you drinking it?"
He glared, panting tiredly. Great tucks 
showed in his overalls where
the folds were stuck together by the 
goo with which he was covered, and I
thought, Tar Baby, and wanted to blot 
him out of my sight. But now my
anger was flowing fast from action to 
words.
"I go to get my lunch and they ask me 
who I work for and when I
tell them, they call me a fink. A fink! 
You people must be out of your minds.
No sooner do I get back down here than 
you start yelling that you're going
to kill me! What's going on? What have 
you got against me? What did I do?"
He glowered at me silently, then 
pointed to the floor.
"Reach and draw back a nub," I warned.
"Caint a man even git his teeth?" he 
mumbled, his voice strange.
"TEETH?"
With a shamed frown, he opened his 
mouth. I saw a blue flash of
shrunken gums. The thing that had 
skittered across the floor was not a 
knife,
but a plate of false teeth. For a 
fraction of a second I was desperate, 
feeling
some of my justification for wanting to 
kill him slipping away. My fingers
leaped to my shoulder, finding wet 
cloth but no blood. The old fool had
bitten me. A wild flash of laughter 
struggled to rise from beneath my anger.
He had bitten me! I looked on the 
floor, seeing the smashed mug and the
teeth glinting dully across the room.
"Get them," I said, growing ashamed. 
Without his teeth, some of the
hatefulness seemed to have gone out of 
him. But I stayed close as he got his
teeth and went over to the tap and held 
them beneath a stream of water. A
tooth fell away beneath the pressure of 
his thumb, and I heard him

grumbling as he placed the plate in his 
mouth. Then, wiggling his chin, he
became himself again.
"You was really trying to kill me," he 
said. He seemed unable to
believe it.
"You started the killing. I don't go 
around fighting," I said. "Why
didn't you let me explain? Is it 
against the law to belong to the union?"
"That damn union," he cried, almost in 
tears. "That damn union!
They after my job! I know they after my 
job! For one of us to join one of
them damn unions is like we was to bite 
the hand of the man who teached
us to bathe in a bathtub! I hates it, 
and I mean to keep on doing all I can
to chase it outta the plant. They after 
my job, the chickenshit bastards!"
Spittle formed at the corners of his 
mouth; he seemed to boil with
hatred.
"But what have I to do with that?" I 
said, feeling suddenly the older.
" 'Cause them young colored fellers up 
in the lab is trying to join
that outfit, that's what! Here the 
white man done give 'em jobs," he 
wheezed
as though pleading a case. "He done 
give 'em good jobs too, and they so
ungrateful they goes and joins up with 
that backbiting union! I never seen
such a no-good ungrateful bunch. All 
they doing is making things bad for the
rest of us!"
"Well, I'm sorry," I said, "I didn't 
know about all that. I came here
to take a temporary job and I certainly 
didn't intend to get mixed up in any
quarrels. But as for us, I'm ready to 
forget our disagreement -- if you are . 
.
." I held out my hand, causing my 
shoulder to pain.
He gave me a gruff look. "You ought to 
have more self-respect than
to fight an old man," he said. "I got 
grown boys older than you."
"I thought you were trying to kill me," 
I said, my hand still
extended. "I thought you had stabbed 
me."
"Well, I don't like a lot of bickering 
and confusion myself," he said,
avoiding my eyes. And it was as though 
the closing of his sticky hand over
mine was a signal. I heard a shrill 
hissing from the boilers behind me and
turned, hearing Brockway yell, "I tole 
you to watch them gauges. Git over to
the big valves, quick!"
I dashed for where a series of valve 
wheels projected from the wall
near the crusher, seeing Brockway 
scrambling away in the other direction,

thinking, Where's he going? as I 
reached the valves, and hearing him 
yell,
"Turn it! Turn it!"
"Which?" I yelled, reaching.
"The white one, fool, the white one!"
I jumped, catching it and pulling down 
with all my weight, feeling it
give. But this only increased the noise 
and I seemed to hear Brockway laugh
as I looked around to see him 
scrambling for the stairs, his hands 
clasping
the back of his head, and his neck 
pulled in close, like a small boy who 
has
thrown a brick into the air.
"Hey you! Hey you!" I yelled. "Hey!" 
But it was too late. All my
movements seemed too slow, ran 
together. I felt the wheel resisting 
and tried
vainly to reverse it and tried to let 
go, and it sticking to my palms and my
fingers stiff and sticky, and I turned, 
running now, seeing the needle on one
of the gauges swinging madly, like a 
beacon gone out of control, and trying
to think clearly, my eyes darting here 
and there through the room of tanks
and machines and up the stairs so far 
away and hearing the clear new note
arising while I seemed to run swiftly 
up an incline and shot forward with
sudden acceleration into a wet blast of 
black emptiness that was somehow a
bath of whiteness.
It was a fall into space that seemed 
not a fall but a suspension.
Then a great weight landed upon me and 
I seemed to sprawl in an interval
of clarity beneath a pile of broken 
machinery, my head pressed back against
a huge wheel, my body splattered with a 
stinking goo. Somewhere an engine
ground in furious futility, grating 
loudly until a pain shot around the 
curve of
my head and bounced me off into 
blackness for a distance, only to strike
another pain that lobbed me back. And 
in that clear instant of consciousness
I opened my eyes to a blinding flash.
Holding on grimly, I could hear the 
sound of someone wading,
sloshing, nearby, and an old man's 
garrulous voice saying, "I tole 'em 
these
here young Nineteen-Hundred boys ain't 
no good for the job. They ain't got
the nerves. Naw, sir, they just ain't 
got the nerves."
I tried to speak, to answer, but 
something heavy moved again, and I
was understanding something fully and 
trying again to answer but seemed to
sink to the center of a lake of heavy 
water and pause, transfixed and numb
with the sense that I had lost 
irrevocably an important victory.

Chapter 11
I was sitting in a cold, white rigid 
chair and a man was looking at
me out of a bright third eye that 
glowed from the center of his forehead. 
He
reached out, touching my skull 
gingerly, and said something 
encouraging, as
though I were a child. His fingers went 
away.
"Take this," he said. "It's good for 
you." I swallowed. Suddenly my
skin itched, all over. I had on new 
overalls, strange white ones. The taste 
ran
bitter through my mouth. My fingers 
trembled.
A thin voice with a mirror on the end 
of it said, "How is he?"
"I don't think it's anything serious. 
Merely stunned."
"Should he be sent home now?"
"No, just to be certain we'll keep him 
here a few days. Want to keep
him under observation. Then he may 
leave."
Now I was lying on a cot, the bright 
eye still burning into mine,
although the man was gone. It was quiet 
and I was numb. I closed my eyes
only to be awakened.
"What is your name?" a voice said.
"My head . . ." I said.
"Yes, but your name. Address?"
"My head -- that burning eye . . ." I 
said.
"Eye?"
"Inside," I said.
"Shoot him up for an X-ray," another 
voice said.
"My head . . ."
"Careful!"
Somewhere a machine began to hum and I 
distrusted the man and
woman above me.
They were holding me firm and it was 
fiery and above it all I kept
hearing the opening motif of 
Beethoven's Fifth -- three short and 
one long

buzz, repeated again and again in 
varying volume, and I was struggling and
breaking through, rising up, to find 
myself lying on my back with two
pink-faced men laughing down.
"Be quiet now," one of them said 
firmly. "You'll be all right." I raised
my eyes, seeing two indefinite young 
women in white, looking down at me. A
third, a desert of heat waves away, sat 
at a panel arrayed with coils and
dials. Where was I? From far below me a 
barber-chair thumping began and I
felt myself rise on the tip of the 
sound from the floor. A face was now 
level
with mine, looking closely and saying 
something without meaning. A whirring
began that snapped and cracked with 
static, and suddenly I seemed to be
crushed between the floor and ceiling. 
Two forces tore savagely at my
stomach and back. A flash of cold-edged 
heat enclosed me. I was pounded
between crushing electrical pressures; 
pumped between live electrodes like an
accordion between a player's hands. My 
lungs were compressed like a bellows
and each time my breath returned I 
yelled, punctuating the rhythmical 
action
of the nodes.
"Hush, goddamit," one of the faces 
ordered. "We're trying to get you
started again. Now shut up!"
The voice throbbed with icy authority 
and I quieted and tried to
contain the pain. I discovered now that 
my head was encircled by a piece of
cold metal like the iron cap worn by 
the occupant of an electric chair. I 
tried
unsuccessfully to struggle, to cry out. 
But the people were so remote, the pain
so immediate. A faced moved in and out 
of the circle of lights, peering for a
moment,

then

disappeared.

A

freckled,

red-haired

woman

with

gold

nose-glasses appeared; then a man with 
a circular mirror attached to his
forehead -- a doctor. Yes, he was a 
doctor and the women were nurses; it
was coming clear. I was in a hospital. 
They would care for me. It was all
geared toward the easing of pain. I 
felt thankful.
I tried to remember how I'd gotten 
here, but nothing came. My mind
was blank, as though I had just begun 
to live. When the next face appeared I
saw the eyes behind the thick glasses 
blinking as though noticing me for the
first time.
"You're all right, boy. You're okay. 
You just be patient," said the
voice, hollow with profound detachment.
I seemed to go away; the lights receded 
like a tail-light racing down

a dark country road. I couldn't follow. 
A sharp pain stabbed my shoulder. I
twisted about on my back, fighting 
something I couldn't see. Then after a
while my vision cleared.
Now a man sitting with his back to me, 
manipulating dials on a
panel. I wanted to call him, but the 
Fifth Symphony rhythm racked me, and
he seemed too serene and too far away. 
Bright metal bars were between us
and when I strained my neck around I 
discovered that I was not lying on an
operating table but in a kind of glass 
and nickel box, the lid of which was
propped open. Why was I here?
"Doctor! Doctor!" I called.
No answer. Perhaps he hadn't heard, I 
thought, calling again and
feeling the stabbing pulses of the 
machine again and feeling myself going
under and fighting against it and 
coming up to hear voices carrying on a
conversation behind my head. The static 
sounds became a quiet drone. Strains
of music, a Sunday air, drifted from a 
distance. With closed eyes, barely
breathing I warded off the pain. The 
voices droned harmoniously. Was it a
radio I heard -- a phonograph? The vox 
humana of a hidden organ? If so,
what organ and where? I felt warm. 
Green hedges, dazzling with red wild
roses appeared behind my eyes, 
stretching with a gentle curving to an 
infinity
empty of objects, a limpid blue space. 
Scenes of a shaded lawn in summer
drifted past; I saw a uniformed 
military band arrayed decorously in 
concert,
each musician with well-oiled hair, 
heard a sweet-voiced trumpet rendering
"The Holy City" as from an echoing 
distance, buoyed by a choir of muted
horns; and above, the mocking obbligato 
of a mocking bird. I felt giddy. The
air seemed to grow thick with fine 
white gnats, filling my eyes, boiling so
thickly that the dark trumpeter 
breathed them in and expelled them 
through
the bell of his golden horn, a live 
white cloud mixing with the tones upon
the torpid air.
I came back. The voices still droned 
above me and I disliked them.
Why didn't they go away? Smug ones. Oh, 
doctor, I thought drowsily, did you
ever wade in a brook before breakfast? 
Ever chew on sugar cane? You know,
doc, the same fall day I first saw the 
hounds chasing black men in stripes
and chains my grandmother sat with me 
and sang with twinkling eyes:
"Godamighty made a monkey

Godamighty made a whale
And Godamighty made a 'gator
With hickeys all over his tail . . ."
Or you, nurse, did you know that when 
you strolled in pink organdy
and picture hat between the rows of 
cape jasmine, cooing to your beau in a
drawl as thick as sorghum, we little 
black boys hidden snug in the bushes
called out so loud that you daren't 
hear:
"Did you ever see Miss Margaret boil 
water?
Man, she hisses a wonderful stream,
Seventeen miles and a quarter,
Man, and you can't see her pot for the 
steam . . ."
But now the music became a distinct 
wail of female pain. I opened
my eyes. Glass and metal floated above 
me.
"How are you feeling, boy?" a voice 
said.
A pair of eyes peered down through 
lenses as thick as the bottom of
a Coca-Cola bottle, eyes protruding, 
luminous and veined, like an old biology
specimen preserved in alcohol.
"I don't have enough room," I said 
angrily.
"Oh, that's a necessary part of the 
treatment."
"But I need more room," I insisted. 
"I'm cramped."
"Don't worry about it, boy. You'll get 
used to it after a while. How is
your stomach and head?"
"Stomach?"
"Yes, and your head?"
"I don't know," I said, realizing that 
I could feel nothing beyond the
pressure around my head and the tender 
surface of my body. Yet my senses
seemed to focus sharply.
"I don't feel it," I cried, alarmed.
"Aha! You see! My little gadget will 
solve everything!" he exploded.
"I don't know," another voice said. "I 
think I still prefer surgery. And
in this case especially, with this, uh 
. . . background, I'm not so sure that I
don't believe in the effectiveness of 
simple prayer."

"Nonsense, from now on do your praying 
to my little machine. I'll
deliver the cure."
"I don't know, but I believe it a 
mistake to assume that solutions 
-cures, that is -- that apply in, uh . 
. . primitive instances, are, uh . . .
equally effective when more advanced 
conditions are in question. Suppose it
were a New Englander with a Harvard 
background?"
"Now you're arguing politics," the 
first voice said banteringly.
"Oh, no, but it is a problem."
I listened with growing uneasiness to 
the conversation fuzzing away
to a whisper. Their simplest words 
seemed to refer to something else, as 
did
many of the notions that unfurled 
through my head. I wasn't sure whether
they were talking about me or someone 
else. Some of it sounded like a
discussion of history . . .
"The machine will produce the results 
of a prefrontal lobotomy
without the negative effects of the 
knife," the voice said. "You see, 
instead of
severing the prefrontal lobe, a single 
lobe, that is, we apply pressure in the
proper degrees to the major centers of 
nerve control -- our concept is Gestalt
-- and the result is as complete a 
change of personality as you'll find in 
your
famous fairy-tale cases of criminals 
transformed into amiable fellows after 
all
that bloody business of a brain 
operation. And what's more," the voice 
went
on triumphantly, "the patient is both 
physically and neurally whole."
"But what of his psychology?"
"Absolutely of no importance!" the 
voice said. "The patient will live
as he has to live, and with absolute 
integrity. Who could ask more? He'll
experience no major conflict of 
motives, and what is even better, 
society will
suffer no traumata on his account."
There was a pause. A pen scratched upon 
paper. Then, "Why not
castration, doctor?" a voice asked 
waggishly, causing me to start, a pain
tearing through me.
"There goes your love of blood again," 
the first voice laughed.
"What's that definition of a surgeon, 
'A butcher with a bad conscience'?"
They laughed.
"It's not so funny. It would be more 
scientific to try to define the
case. It has been developing some three 
hundred years --"
"Define? Hell, man, we know all that."

"Then why don't you try more current?"
"You suggest it?"
"I do, why not?"
"But isn't there a danger . . . ?" the 
voice trailed off.
I heard them move away; a chair 
scraped. The machine droned, and
I knew definitely that they were 
discussing me and steeled myself for the
shocks, but was blasted nevertheless. 
The pulse came swift and staccato,
increasing gradually until I fairly 
danced between the nodes. My teeth
chattered. I closed my eyes and bit my 
lips to smother my screams. Warm
blood filled my mouth. Between my lids 
I saw a circle of hands and faces,
dazzling with light. Some were 
scribbling upon charts.
"Look, he's dancing," someone called.
"No, really?"
An oily face looked in. "They really do 
have rhythm, don't they? Get
hot, boy! Get hot!" it said with a 
laugh.
And suddenly my bewilderment suspended 
and I wanted to be angry,
murderously angry. But somehow the 
pulse of current smashing through my
body prevented me. Something had been 
disconnected. For though I had
seldom used my capacities for anger and 
indignation, I had no doubt that I
possessed them; and, like a man who 
knows that he must fight, whether
angry or not, when called a son of a 
bitch, I tried to imagine myself angry 
-only to discover a deeper sense of 
remoteness. I was beyond anger. I was
only bewildered. And those above seemed 
to sense it. There was no avoiding
the shock and I rolled with the 
agitated tide, out into the blackness.
When I emerged, the lights were still 
there. I lay beneath the slab of
glass, feeling deflated. All my limbs 
seemed amputated. It was very warm. A
dim white ceiling stretched far above 
me. My eyes were swimming with tears.
Why, I didn't know. It worried me. I 
wanted to knock on the glass to attract
attention, but I couldn't move. The 
slightest effort, hardly more than 
desire,
tired me. I lay experiencing the vague 
processes of my body. I seemed to
have lost all sense of proportion. 
Where did my body end and the crystal 
and
white world begin? Thoughts evaded me, 
hiding in the vast stretch of clinical
whiteness to which I seemed connected 
only by a scale of receding grays. No
sounds beyond the sluggish inner roar 
of the blood. I couldn't open my eyes.
I seemed to exist in some other 
dimension, utterly alone; until after a 
while a

nurse bent down and forced a warm fluid 
between my lips. I gagged,
swallowed, feeling the fluid course 
slowly to my vague middle. A huge
iridescent bubble seemed to enfold me. 
Gentle hands moved over me,
bringing vague impressions of memory. I 
was laved with warm liquids, felt
gentle hands move through the 
indefinite limits of my flesh. The 
sterile and
weightless texture of a sheet enfolded 
me. I felt myself bounce, sail off like 
a
ball thrown over the roof into mist, 
striking a hidden wall beyond a pile of
broken machinery and sailing back. How 
long it took, I didn't know. But now
above the movement of the hands I heard 
a friendly voice, uttering familiar
words to which I could assign no 
meaning. I listened intensely, aware of 
the
form and movement of sentences and 
grasping the now subtle rhythmical
differences between progressions of 
sound that questioned and those that
made a statement. But still their 
meanings were lost in the vast 
whiteness in
which I myself was lost.
Other voices emerged. Faces hovered 
above me like inscrutable fish
peering myopically through a glass 
aquarium wall. I saw them suspended
motionless above me, then two floating 
off, first their heads, then the tips of
their finlike fingers, moving dreamily 
from the top of the case. A thoroughly
mysterious coming and going, like the 
surging of torpid tides. I watched the
two make furious movements with their 
mouths. I didn't understand. They
tried again, the meaning still escaping 
me. I felt uneasy. I saw a scribbled
card, held over me. All a jumble of 
alphabets. They consulted heatedly.
Somehow I felt responsible. A terrible 
sense of loneliness came over me; they
seemed to enact a mysterious pantomime. 
And seeing them from this angle
was disturbing. They appeared utterly 
stupid and I didn't like it. It wasn't
right. I could see smut in one doctor's 
nose; a nurse had two flabby chins.
Other faces came up, their mouths 
working with soundless fury. But we are
all human, I thought, wondering what I 
meant.
A man dressed in black appeared, a 
long-haired fellow, whose
piercing eyes looked down upon me out 
of an intense and friendly face. The
others hovered about him, their eyes 
anxious as he alternately peered at me
and consulted my chart. Then he 
scribbled something on a large card and
thrust it before my eyes:
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

A tremor shook me; it was as though he 
had suddenly given a name
to, had organized the vagueness that 
drifted through my head, and I was
overcome with swift shame. I realized 
that I no longer knew my own name. I
shut my eyes and shook my head with 
sorrow. Here was the first warm
attempt to communicate with me and I 
was failing. I tried again, plunging
into the blackness of my mind. It was 
no use; I found nothing but pain. I
saw the card again and he pointed 
slowly to each word:
WHAT . . . IS . . . YOUR . . . NAME?
I tried desperately, diving below the 
blackness until I was limp with
fatigue. It was as though a vein had 
been opened and my energy syphoned
away; I could only stare back mutely. 
But with an irritating burst of activity
he gestured for another card and wrote:
WHO . . . ARE . . . YOU?
Something inside me turned with a 
sluggish excitement. This phrasing
of the question seemed to set off a 
series of weak and distant lights where
the other had thrown a spark that 
failed. Who am I? I asked myself. But it
was like trying to identify one 
particular cell that coursed through 
the torpid
veins of my body. Maybe I was just this 
blackness and bewilderment and
pain, but that seemed less like a 
suitable answer than something I'd read
somewhere.
The card was back again:
WHAT IS YOUR MOTHER'S NAME?
Mother, who was my mother? Mother, the 
one who screams when
you suffer -- but who? This was stupid, 
you always knew your mother's
name. Who was it that screamed? Mother? 
But the scream came from the
machine. A machine my mother? . . . 
Clearly, I was out of my head.
He shot questions at me: Where were you 
born? Try to think of your
name.

I tried, thinking vainly of many names, 
but none seemed to fit, and
yet it was as though I was somehow a 
part of all of them, had become
submerged within them and lost.
You must remember, the placard read. 
But it was useless. Each time
I found myself back in the clinging 
white mist and my name just beyond my
fingertips. I shook my head and watched 
him disappear for a moment and
return with a companion, a short, 
scholarly looking man who stared at me
with a blank expression. I watched him 
produce a child's slate and a piece of
chalk, writing upon it:
WHO WAS YOUR MOTHER?
I looked at him, feeling a quick 
dislike and thinking, half in
amusement, I don't play the dozens. And 
how's your old lady today?
THINK
I stared, seeing him frown and write a 
long time. The slate was filled
with meaningless names.
I smiled, seeing his eyes blaze with 
annoyance. Old Friendly Face
said something. The new man wrote a 
question at which I stared in
wide-eyed amazement:
WHO WAS BUCKEYE THE RABBIT?
I was filled with turmoil. Why should 
he think of that? He pointed
to the question, word by word. I 
laughed, deep, deep inside me, giddy 
with
the delight of self-discovery and the 
desire to hide it. Somehow I was
Buckeye the Rabbit . . . or had been, 
when as children we danced and sang
barefoot in the dusty streets:
Buckeye the Rabbit
Shake it, shake it
Buckeye the Rabbit
Break it, break it . . .

Yet, I could not bring myself to admit 
it, it was too ridiculous -- and
somehow too dangerous. It was annoying 
that he had hit upon an old
identity and I shook my head, seeing 
him purse his lips and eye me sharply.
BOY, WHO WAS BRER RABBIT?
He was your mother's back-door man, I 
thought. Anyone knew they
were one and the same: "Buckeye" when 
you were very young and hid
yourself behind wide innocent eyes; 
"Brer," when you were older. But why
was he playing around with these 
childish names? Did they think I was a
child? Why didn't they leave me alone? 
I would remember soon enough when
they let me out of the machine . . . A 
palm smacked sharply upon the glass,
but I was tired of them. Yet as my eyes 
focused upon Old Friendly Face he
seemed pleased. I couldn't understand 
it, but there he was, smiling and
leaving witrr the new assistant.
Left alone, I lay fretting over my 
identity. I suspected that I was
really playing a game with myself and 
that they were taking part. A kind of
combat. Actually they knew as well as 
I, and I for some reason preferred not
to face it. It was irritating, and it 
made me feel sly and alert. I would 
solve
the mystery the next instant. I 
imagined myself whirling about in my 
mind
like an old man attempting to catch a 
small boy in some mischief, thinking,
Who am I? It was no good. I felt like a 
clown. Nor was I up to being both
criminal and detective -- though why 
criminal I didn't know.
I fell to plotting ways of 
short-circuiting the machine. Perhaps 
if I
shifted my body about so that the two 
nodes would come together -- No, not
only was there no room but it might 
electrocute me. I shuddered. Whoever
else I was, I was no Samson. I had no 
desire to destroy myself even if it
destroyed the machine; I wanted 
freedom, not destruction. It was 
exhausting,
for no matter what the scheme I 
conceived, there was one constant flaw 
-myself. There was no getting around 
it. I could no more escape than I could
think of my identity. Perhaps, I 
thought, the two things are involved 
with
each other. When I discover who I am, 
I'll be free.
It was as though my thoughts of escape 
had alerted them. I looked
up to see two agitated physicians and a 
nurse, and thought, It's too late now,

and lay in a veil of sweat watching 
them manipulate the controls. I was
braced for the usual shock, but nothing 
happened. Instead I saw their hands
at the lid, loosening the bolts, and 
before I could react they had opened the
lid and pulled me erect.
"What's happened?" I began, seeing the 
nurse pause to look at me.
"Well?" she said.
My mouth worked soundlessly.
"Come on, get it out," she said.
"What hospital is this?" I said.
"It's the factory hospital," she said. 
"Now be quiet."
They were around me now, inspecting my 
body, and I watched with
growing bewilderment, thinking, what is 
a factory hospital?
I felt a tug at my belly and looked 
down to see one of the
physicians pull the cord which was 
attached to the stomach node, jerking me
forward.
"What is this?" I said.
"Get the shears," he said.
"Sure," the other said. "Let's not 
waste time."
I recoiled inwardly as though the cord 
were part of me. Then they
had it free and the nurse clipped 
through the belly band and removed the
heavy node. I opened my mouth to speak 
but one of the physicians shook his
head. They worked swiftly. The nodes 
off, the nurse went over me with
rubbing alcohol. Then I was told to 
climb out of the case. I looked from 
face
to face, overcome with indecision. For 
now that it appeared that I was being
freed, I dared not believe it. What if 
they were transferring me to some even
more painful machine? I sat there, 
refusing to move. Should I struggle 
against
them?
"Take his arm," one of them said.
"I can do it," I said, climbing 
fearfully out.
I was told to stand while they went 
over my body with the
stethoscope.
"How's the articulation?" the one with 
the chart said as the other
examined my shoulder.
"Perfect," he said.
I could feel a tightness there but no 
pain.

"I'd say he's surprisingly strong, 
considering," the other said.
"Shall we call in Drexel? It seems 
rather unusual for him to be so
strong."
"No, just note it on the chart."
"All right, nurse, give him his 
clothes."
"What are you going to do with me?" I 
said. She handed me clean
underclothing and a pair of white 
overalls.
"No questions," she said. "Just dress 
as quickly as possible."
The air outside the machine seemed 
extremenly rare. When I bent
over to tie my shoes I thought I would 
faint, but fought it off. I stood
shakily and they looked me up and down.
"Well, boy, it looks as though you're 
cured," one of them said.
"You're a new man. You came through 
fine. Come with us," he said.
We went slowly out of the room and down 
a long white corridor into
an elevator, then swiftly down three 
floors to a reception room with rows of
chairs. At the front were a number of 
private offices with frosted glass doors
and walls.
"Sit down there," they said. "The 
director will see you shortly."
I sat, seeing them disappear inside one 
of the offices for a second
and emerge, passing me without a word. 
I trembled like a leaf. Were they
really freeing me? My head spun. I 
looked at my white overalls. The nurse
said that this was the factory hospital 
. . . Why couldn't I remember what
kind of factory it was? And why a 
factory hospital? Yes . . . I did 
remember
some vague factory; perhaps I was being 
sent back there. Yes, and he'd
spoken of the director instead of the 
head doctor; could they be one and the
same? Perhaps I was in the factory 
already. I listened but could hear no
machinery.

ACROSS the room a newspaper lay on a 
chair, but I was too
concerned to get it. Somewhere a fan 
droned. Then one of the doors with
frosted glass was opened and I saw a 
tall austere-looking man in a white
coat, beckoning to me with a chart.
"Come," he said.
I got up and went past him into a large 
simply furnished office,

thinking, Now, I'll know. Now.
"Sit down," he said.
I eased myself into the chair beside 
his desk. He watched me with a
calm, scientific gaze.
"What is your name? Oh here, I have 
it," he said, studying the chart.
And it was as though someone inside of 
me tried to tell him to be silent, but
already he had called my name and I 
heard myself say, "Oh!" as a pain
stabbed through my head and I shot to 
my feet and looked wildly around me
and sat down and got up and down again 
very fast, remembering. I don't
know why I did it, but suddenly I saw 
him looking at me intently, and I
stayed down this time.
He began asking questions and I could 
hear myself replying fluently,
though inside I was reeling with 
swiftly changing emotional images that
shrilled and chattered, like a 
sound-track reversed at high speed.
"Well, my boy," he said, "you're cured. 
We are going to release you.
How does that strike you?"
Suddenly I didn't know. I noticed a 
company calendar beside a
stethoscope and a miniature silver 
paint brush. Did he mean from the
hospital or from the job? . . .
"Sir?" I said.
"I said, how does that strike you?"
"All right, sir," I said in an unreal 
voice. "I'll be glad to get back to
work."
He looked at the chart, frowning. 
"You'll be released, but I'm afraid
that you'll be disappointed about the 
work," he said.
"What do you mean, sir?"
"You've been through a severe 
experience," he said. "You aren't ready
for the rigors of industry. Now I want 
you to rest, undertake a period of
convalescence. You need to become 
readjusted and get your strength back."
"But, sir --"
"You mustn't try to go too fast. You're 
glad to be released, are you
not?"
"Oh, yes. But how shall I live?"
"Live?" his eyebrows raised and 
lowered. "Take another job," he said.
"Something easier, quieter. Something 
for which you're better prepared."

"Prepared?" I looked at him, thinking, 
Is he in on it too? "I'll take
anything, sir," I said.
"That isn't the problem, my boy. You 
just aren't prepared for work
under our industrial conditions. Later, 
perhaps, but not now. And remember,
you'll be adequately compensated for 
your experience."
"Compensated, sir?"
"Oh,

yes,"

he

said.

"We

follow

a

policy

of

enlightened

humanitarianism; all our employees are 
automatically insured. You have only
to sign a few papers."
"What kind of papers, sir?"
"We require an affidavit releasing the 
company of responsibility," he
said. "Yours was a difficult case, and 
a number of specialists had to be called
in. But, after all, any new occupation 
has its hazards. They are part of
growing up, of becoming adjusted, as it 
were. One takes a chance and while
some are prepared, others are not."
I looked at his lined face. Was he 
doctor, factory official, or both? I
couldn't get it; and now he seemed to 
move back and forth across my field
of vision, although he sat perfectly 
calm in his chair.
It came out of itself: "Do you know Mr. 
Norton, sir?" I said.
"Norton?" His brows knitted. "What 
Norton is this?"
Then it was as though I hadn't asked 
him; the name sounded
strange. I ran my hand over my eyes.
"I'm sorry," I said. "It occurred to me 
that you might. He was just a
man I used to know."
"I see. Well" -- he picked up some 
papers -- "so that's the way it is,
my boy. A little later perhaps we'll be 
able to do something. You may take
the papers along if you wish. Just mail 
them to us. Your check will be sent
upon their return. Meanwhile, take as 
much time as you like. You'll find that
we are perfectly fair."
I took the folded papers and looked at 
him for what seemed to be
too long a time. He seemed to waver. 
Then I heard myself say, "Do you
know him?" my voice rising.
"Who?"
"Mr. Norton," I said. "Mr. Norton!"
"Oh, why, no."

"No," I said, "no one knows anybody and 
it was too long a time
ago."
He frowned and I laughed. "They picked 
poor Robin clean," I said.
"Do you happen to know Bled?"
He looked at me, his head to one side. 
"Are these people friends of
yours?"
"Friends? Oh, yes," I said, "we're all 
good friends. Buddies from way
back. But I don't suppose we get around 
in the same circles."
His eyes widened. "No," he said, "I 
don't suppose we do. However,
good friends are valuable to have."
I felt light-headed and started to 
laugh and he seemed to waver
again and I thought of asking him about 
Emerson, but now he was clearing
his throat and indicating that he was 
finished.
I put the folded papers in my overalls 
and started out. The door
beyond the rows of chairs seemed far 
away.
"Take care of yourself," he said.
"And you," I said, thinking, it's time, 
it's past time.
Turning abruptly, I went weakly back to 
the desk, seeing him looking
up at me with his steady scientific 
gaze. I was overcome with ceremonial
feelings but unable to remember the 
proper formula. So as I deliberately
extended my hand I fought down laughter 
with a cough.
"It's been quite pleasant, our little 
palaver, sir," I said. I listened to
myself and to his answer.
"Yes, indeed," he said.
He shook my hand gravely, without 
surprise or distaste. I looked
down, he was there somewhere behind the 
lined face and outstretched hand.
"And now our palaver is finished," I 
said. "Good-bye."
He raised his hand. "Good-bye," he 
said, his voice noncommittal.
Leaving him and going out into the 
paint-fuming air I had the
feeling that I had been talking beyond 
myself, had used words and expressed
attitudes not my own, that I was in the 
grip of some alien personality lodged
deep within me. Like the servant about 
whom I'd read in psychology class
who, during a trance, had recited pages 
of Greek philosophy which she had
overheard one day while she worked. It 
was as though I were acting out a
scene from some crazy movie. Or perhaps 
I was catching up with myself and

had put into words feelings which I had 
hitherto suppressed. Or was it, I
thought, starting up the walk, that I 
was no longer afraid? I stopped, looking
at the buildings down the bright street 
slanting with sun and shade. I was no
longer afraid. Not of important men, 
not of trustees and such; for knowing
now that there was nothing which I 
could expect from them, there was no
reason to be afraid. Was that it? I 
felt light-headed, my ears were 
ringing. I
went on.
Along the walk the buildings rose, 
uniform and close together. It was
day's end now and on top of every 
building the flags were fluttering and
diving down, collapsing. And I felt 
that I would fall, had fallen, moved now
as against a current sweeping swiftly 
against me. Out of the grounds and up
the street I found the bridge by which 
I'd come, but the stairs leading back
to the car that crossed the top were 
too dizzily steep to climb, swim or fly,
and I found a subway instead.
Things whirled too fast around me. My 
mind went alternately bright
and blank in slow rolling waves. We, 
he, him -- my mind and I -- were no
longer getting around in the same 
circles. Nor my body either. Across the
aisle a young platinum blonde nibbled 
at a red Delicious apple as station
lights rippled past behind her. The 
train plunged. I dropped through the 
roar,
giddy and vacuum-minded, sucked under 
and out into late afternoon Harlem.

Chapter 12
When I came out of the subway, Lenox 
Avenue seemed to careen
away from me at a drunken angle, and I 
focused upon the teetering scene
with

wild,

infant's

eyes,

my

head

throbbing.

Two

huge

women

with

spoiled-cream complexions seemed to 
struggle with their massive bodies as
they came past, their flowered hips 
trembling like threatening flames. Out
across the walk before me they moved, 
and a bright orange slant of sun
seemed to boil up and I saw myself 
going down, my legs watery beneath me,
but my head clear, too clear, recording 
the crowd swerving around me: legs,

feet, eyes, hands, bent knees, scuffed 
shoes, teethy-eyed excitement; and some
moving on unhalting.
And the big dark woman saying, Boy, is 
you all right, what's wrong?
in a husky-voiced contralto. And me 
saying, I'm all right, just weak, and
trying to stand, and her saying, Why 
don't y'all stand back and let the man
breathe? Stand back there y'all, and 
now echoed by an official tone, Keep
moving, break it up. And she on one 
side and a man on the other, helping
me to stand and the policeman saying, 
Are you all right? and me answering,
Yes, I just felt weak, must have 
fainted but all right now, and him 
ordering
the crowd to move on and the others 
moving on except the man and woman
and him saying, You sure you okay, 
daddy, and me nodding yes, and her
saying, Where you live son, somewhere 
around here? And me telling her
Men's House and her looking at me 
shaking her head saying, Men's House,
Men's House, shucks that ain't no place 
for nobody in your condition what's
weak and needs a woman to keep an eye 
on you awhile. And me saying, But
I'll be all right now, and her, Maybe 
you will and maybe you won't. I live
just up the street and round the 
corner, you better come on round and 
rest
till you feel stronger. I'll phone 
Men's House and tell 'em where you at. 
And
me too tired to resist and already she 
had one arm and was instructing the
fellow to take the other and we went, 
me between them, inwardly rejecting
and yet accepting her bossing, hearing, 
You take it easy, I'll take care of you
like I done a heap of others, my name's 
Mary Rambo, everybody knows me
round this part of Harlem, you heard of 
me, ain't you? And the fellow saying,
Sure, I'm Jenny Jackson's boy, you know 
I know you, Miss Mary. And her
saying, Jenny Jackson, why, I should 
say you do know me and I know you,
you Ralston, and your mama got two more 
children, boy named Flint and gal
named Laurajean, I should say I know 
you -- me and your mama and your
papa useta -- And me saying, I'm all 
right now, really all right. And her
saying, And looking like that, you must 
be worse off even than you look, and
pulling me now saying, Here's my house 
right here, hep me git him up the
steps and inside, you needn't worry, 
son, I ain't never laid eyes on you 
before
and it ain't my business and I don't 
care what you think about me but you
weak and caint hardly walk and all and 
you look what's more like you
hungry, so just come on and let me do 
something for you like I hope you'd
do something for ole Mary in case she 
needed it, it ain't costing you a penny

and I don't want to git in your 
business, I just want you to lay down 
till you
rested and then you can go. And the 
fellow taking it up, saying, You in good
hands, daddy, Miss Mary always helping 
somebody and you need some help
'cause here you black as me and white 
as a sheet, as the ofays would say 
-watch these steps. And going up some 
steps and then some more, growing
weaker, and the two warm around me on 
each side of me, and then inside a
cool dark room, hearing, Here, here's 
the bed, lie him down there, there,
there now, that's it, Ralston, now put 
his legs up -- never mind the cover 
-there, that's it, now go out there in 
the kitchen and pour him a glass of
water, you'll find a bottle in the 
ice-box. And him going and her placing
another pillow beneath my head, saying, 
Now you'll be better and when you
git all right you'll know how bad a 
shape you been in, here, now taka sip of
this water, and me drinking and seeing 
her worn brown fingers holding the
bright glass and a feeling of old, 
almost forgotten relief coming over me 
and
thinking in echo of her words, If I 
don't think I'm sinking, look what a 
hole
I'm in, and then the soft cool splash 
of sleep.

I SAW her across the room when I awoke, 
reading a newspaper, her
glasses low across the bridge of her 
nose as she stared at the page intently.
Then I realized that though the glasses 
still slanted down, the eyes were no
longer focused on the page, but on my 
face and lighting with a slow smile.
"How you feel now?" she said.
"Much better."
"I thought you would be. And you be 
even better after you have a
cup of soup I got for you in the 
kitchen. You slept a good long time."
"Did I?" I said. "What time is it?"
"It's about ten o'clock, and from the 
way you slept I suspects all you
needed was some rest . . . No, don't 
git up yet. You got to drink your soup,
then you can go," she said, leaving.
She returned with a bowl in a plate. 
"This here'll fix you up," she
said. "You don't get this kind of 
service up there at Men's House, do you?
Now, you just sit there and take your 
time. I ain't got nothing to do but read
the paper. And I like company. You have 
to make time in the morning?"
"No, I've been sick," I said. "But I 
have to look for a job."

"I knowed you wasn't well. Why you try 
to hide it?"
"I didn't want to be trouble to 
anyone," I said.
"Everybody has to be trouble to 
somebody. And you just come from
the hospital too."
I looked up. She sat in the rocking 
chair bent forward, her arms
folded at ease across her aproned lap. 
Had she searched my pockets?
"How did you know that?" I said.
"There you go getting suspicious," she 
said sternly. "That's what's
wrong with the world today, don't 
nobody trust nobody. I can smell that
hospital smell on you, son. You got 
enough ether in those clothes to put to
sleep a dog!"
"I couldn't remember telling you that I 
had been in the hospital."
"No, and you didn't have to. I smelled 
that out. You got people here
in the city?"
"No, ma'm," I said. "They're down 
South. I came up here to work so
I could go to school, and I got sick."
"Now ain't that too bad! But you'll 
make out all right. What you plan
to make out of yourself?"
"I don't know now; I came here wanting 
to be an educator. Now I
don't know."
"So what's wrong with being an 
educator?"
I thought about it while sipping the 
good hot soup. "Nothing, I
suppose, I just think I'd like to do 
something else."
"Well, whatever it is, I hope it's 
something that's a credit to the
race."
"I hope so," I said.
"Don't hope, make it that way."
I looked at her thinking of what I'd 
tried to do and of where it had
gotten me, seeing her heavy, composed 
figure before me.
"It's you young folks what's going to 
make the changes," she said.
"Y'all's the ones. You got to lead and 
you got to fight and move us all on up
a little higher. And I tell you 
something else, it's the one's from the 
South
that's got to do it, them what knows 
the fire and ain't forgot how it burns.
Up here too many forgits. They finds a 
place for theyselves and forgits the
ones on the bottom. Oh, heap of them 
talks about doing things, but they

done really forgot. No, it's you young 
ones what has to remember and take
the lead."
"Yes," I said.
"And you have to take care of yourself, 
son. Don't let this Harlem git
you. I'm in New York but New York ain't 
in me, understand what I mean?
Don't git corrupted."
"I won't. I'll be too busy."
"All right now, you looks to me like 
you might make something out
of yourself, so you be careful."
I got up to go, watching her raise 
herself out of her chair and come
with me to the door.
"You ever decide you want a room 
somewhere beside Men's House,
try me," she said. "The rent's 
reasonable."
"I'll remember that," I said.

I WAS to remember sooner than I had 
thought. The moment I
entered the bright, buzzing lobby of 
Men's House I was overcome by a sense
of alienation and hostility. My 
overalls were causing stares and I knew 
that I
could live there no longer, that that 
phase of my life was past. The lobby was
the meeting place for various groups 
still caught up in the illusions that 
had
just been boomeranged out of my head: 
college boys working to return to
school down South; older advocates of 
racial progress with Utopian schemes
for building black business empires; 
preachers ordained by no authority 
except
their own, without church or 
congregation, without bread or wine, 
body or
blood; the community "leaders" without 
followers; old men of sixty or more
still caught up in post-Civil-War 
dreams of freedom within segregation; 
the
pathetic ones who possessed nothing 
beyond their dreams of being gentlemen,
who held small jobs or drew small 
pensions, and all pretending to be
engaged

in

some

vast,

though

obscure,

enterprise,

who

affected

the

pseudo-courtly manners of certain 
southern congressmen and bowed and
nodded as they passed like senile old 
roosters in a barnyard; the younger
crowd for whom I now felt a contempt 
such as only a disillusioned dreamer
feels for those still unaware that they 
dream -- the business students from
southern colleges, for whom business 
was a vague, abstract game with rules

as obsolete as Noah's Ark but who yet 
were drunk on finance. Yes, and that
older group with similar aspirations, 
the "fundamentalists," the "actors" who
sought to achieve the status of brokers 
through imagination alone, a group of
janitors and messengers who spent most 
of their wages on clothing such as
was fashionable among Wall Street 
brokers, with their Brooks Brothers 
suits
and bowler hats, English umbrellas, 
black calfskin shoes and yellow gloves;
with their orthodox and passionate 
argument as to what was the correct tie
to wear with what shirt, what shade of 
gray was correct for spats and what
would the Prince of Wales wear at a 
certain seasonal event; should field
glasses be slung from the right or from 
the left shoulder; who never read the
financial pages though they purchased 
the Wall Street Journal religiously and
carried it beneath the left elbow, 
pressed firm against the body and 
grasped
in the left hand -- always manicured 
and gloved, fair weather or foul -- with
an easy precision (Oh, they had style) 
while the other hand whipped a tightly
rolled umbrella back and forth at a 
calculated angle; with their homburgs 
and
Chesterfields, their polo coats and 
Tyrolean hats worn strictly as fashion
demanded.
I could feel their eyes, saw them all 
and saw too the time when they
would know that my prospects were ended 
and saw already the contempt
they'd feel for me, a college man who 
had lost his prospects and pride. I
could see it all and I knew that even 
the officials and the older men would
despise me as though, somehow, in 
losing my place in Bledsoe's world I had
betrayed them . . . I saw it as they 
looked at my overalls.
I had started toward the elevator when 
I heard the voice raised in
laughter and turned to see him holding 
forth to a group in the lobby chairs
and the rolls of fat behind the 
wrinkled, high-domed, close-cut head, 
and I
was certain that it was he and stooped 
without thought and lifted it shining,
full and foul, and moved forward two 
long steps, dumping its great brown,
transparent splash upon the head warned 
too late by someone across the
room. And too late for me to see that 
it was not Bledsoe but a preacher, a
prominent Baptist, who shot up 
wide-eyed with disbelief and outrage, 
and I
shot around and out of the lobby before 
anyone could think to stop me.
No one followed me and I wandered the 
streets amazed at my own
action. Later it began to rain and I 
sneaked back near Men's House and
persuaded an amused porter to slip my 
things out to me. I learned that I

had been barred from the building for 
"ninety-nine years and a day."
"You might not can come back, man," the 
porter said, "but after
what you did, I swear, they never will 
stop talking about you. You really
baptized ole Rev!"

So THAT same night I went back to 
Mary's, where I lived in a small
but comfortable room until the ice came.
It was a period of quietness. I paid my 
way with my compensation
money and found living with her 
pleasant except for her constant talk 
about
leadership and responsibility. And even 
this was not too bad as long as I
could pay my way. It was, however, a 
small compensation, and when after
several months my money ran out and I 
was looking again for a job, I found
her exceedingly irritating to listen 
to. Still, she never dunned me and was 
as
generous with her servings of food 
during mealtime as ever. "It's just hard
times you going through," she'd say. 
"Everybody worth his salt has his hard
times, and when you git to be somebody 
you'll see these here very same hard
times helped you a heap."
I didn't see it that way. I had lost my 
sense of direction. I spent my
time, when not looking for work, in my 
room, where I read countless books
from the library. Sometimes, when there 
was still money, or when I had
earned a few dollars waiting table, I'd 
eat out and wander the streets until
late at night. Other than Mary I had no 
friends and desired none. Nor did I
think of Mary as a "friend"; she was 
something more -- a force, a stable,
familiar force like something out of my 
past which kept me from whirling off
into some unknown which I dared not 
face. It was a most painful position,
for at the same time, Mary reminded me 
constantly that something was
expected of me, some act of leadership, 
some newsworthy achievement; and I
was torn between resenting her for it 
and loving her for the nebulous hope
she kept alive.
I had no doubt that I could do 
something, but what, and how? I had
no contacts and I believed in nothing. 
And the obsession with my identity
which I had developed in the factory 
hospital returned with a vengeance.
Who was I, how had I come to be? 
Certainly I couldn't help being 
different
from when I left the campus; but now a 
new, painful, contradictory voice had

grown up within me, and between its 
demands for revengeful action and
Mary's silent pressure I throbbed with 
guilt and puzzlement. I wanted peace
and quiet, tranquillity, but was too 
much aboil inside. Somewhere beneath the
load of the emotion-freezing ice which 
my life had conditioned my brain to
produce, a spot of black anger glowed 
and threw off a hot red light of such
intensity that had Lord Kelvin known of 
its existence, he would have had to
revise his measurements. A remote 
explosion had occurred somewhere,
perhaps back at Emerson's or that night 
in Bledsoe's office, and it had caused
the ice cap to melt and shift the 
slightest bit. But that bit, that 
fraction, was
irrevocable. Coming to New York had 
perhaps been an unconscious attempt to
keep the old freezing unit going, but 
it hadn't worked; hot water had gotten
into its coils. Only a drop, perhaps, 
but that drop was the first wave of the
deluge. One moment I believed, I was 
dedicated, willing to lie on the blazing
coals, do anything to attain a position 
on the campus -- then snap! It was
done with, finished, through. Now there 
was only the problem of forgetting it.
If only all the contradictory voices 
shouting inside my head would calm down
and sing a song in unison, whatever it 
was I wouldn't care as long as they
sang without dissonance; yes, and 
avoided the uncertain extremes of the 
scale.
But there was no relief. I was wild 
with resentment but too much under
"self-control," that frozen virtue, 
that freezing vice. And the more 
resentful I
became, the more my old urge to make 
speeches returned. While walking
along the streets words would spill 
from my lips in a mumble over which I
had little control. I became afraid of 
what I might do. All things were indeed
awash in my mind. I longed for home.
And while the ice was melting to form a 
flood in which I threatened
to drown I awoke one afternoon to find 
that my first northern winter had
set.

Chapter 13
At first I had turned away from the 
window and tried to read but

my mind kept wandering back to my old 
problems and, unable to endure it
any longer, I rushed from the house, 
extremely agitated but determined to get
away from my hot thoughts into the 
chill air.
At the entrance I bumped against a 
woman who called me a filthy
name, only causing me to increase my 
speed. In a few minutes I was several
blocks away, having moved to the next 
avenue and downtown. The streets
were covered with ice and soot-flecked 
snow and from above a feeble sun
filtered through the haze. I walked 
with my head down, feeling the biting 
air.
And yet I was hot, burning with an 
inner fever. I barely raised my eyes 
until
a car, passing with a thudding of skid 
chains whirled completely around on
the ice, then turned cautiously and 
thudded off again.
I walked slowly on, blinking my eyes in 
the chill air, my mind a blur
with the hot inner argument continuing. 
The whole of Harlem seemed to fall
apart in the swirl of snow. I imagined 
I was lost and for a moment there
was an eerie quiet. I imagined I heard 
the fall of snow upon snow. What did
it mean? I walked, my eyes focused into 
the endless succession of barber
shops, beauty parlors, confectioneries, 
luncheonettes, fish houses, and hog
maw joints, walking close to the 
windows, the snowflakes lacing swift
between, simultaneously forming a 
curtain, a veil, and stripping it 
aside. A
flash of red and gold from a window 
filled with religious articles caught my
eye. And behind the film of frost 
etching the glass I saw two brashly 
painted
plaster images of Mary and Jesus 
surrounded by dream books, love powders,
God-Is-Love signs, money-drawing oil 
and plastic dice. A black statue of a
nude Nubian slave grinned out at me 
from beneath a turban of gold. I
passed on to a window decorated with 
switches of wiry false hair, ointments
guaranteed to produce the miracle of 
whitening black skin. "You too can be
truly beautiful," a sign proclaimed. 
"Win greater happiness with whiter
complexion. Be outstanding in your 
social set."
I hurried on, suppressing a savage urge 
to push my fist through the
pane. A wind was rising, the snow 
thinning. Where would I go? To a movie?
Could I sleep there? I ignored the 
windows now and walked along, becoming
aware that I was muttering to myself 
again. Then far down at the corner I
saw an old man warming his hands 
against the sides of an odd-looking
wagon, from which a stovepipe reeled 
off a thin spiral of smoke that drifted
the odor of baking yams slowly to me, 
bringing a stab of swift nostalgia. I

stopped as though struck by a shot, 
deeply inhaling, remembering, my mind
surging back, back. At home we'd bake 
them in the hot coals of the fireplace,
had carried them cold to school for 
lunch, munched them secretly, squeezing
the sweet pulp from the soft peel as we 
hid from the teacher behind the
largest book, the World's Geography. 
Yes, and we'd loved them candied, or
baked in a cobbler, deep-fat fried in a 
pocket of dough, or roasted with pork
and glazed with the well-browned fat; 
had chewed them raw -- yams and
years ago. More yams than years ago 
though the time seemed endlessly
expanded, stretched thin as the 
spiraling smoke beyond all recall.
I moved again. "Get yo' hot, baked 
Car'lina yam," he called. At the
corner the old man, wrapped in an army 
overcoat, his feet covered with
gunny sacks, his head in a knitted cap, 
was puttering with a stack of paper
bags. I saw a crude sign on the side of 
the wagon proclaiming YAMS, as I
walked flush into the warmth thrown by 
the coals that glowed in a grate
underneath.
"How much are your yams?" I said, 
suddenly hungry.
"They ten cents and they sweet," he 
said, his voice quavering with
age. "These ain't none of them binding 
ones neither. These here is real,
sweet, yaller yams. How many?"
"One," I said. "If they're that good, 
one should be enough."
He gave me a searching glance. There 
was a tear in the corner of his
eye. He chuckled and opened the door of 
the improvised oven, reaching
gingerly with his gloved hand. The 
yams, some bubbling with syrup, lay on a
wire rack above glowing coals that 
leaped to low blue flame when struck by
the draft of air. The flash of warmth 
set my face aglow as he removed one of
the yams and shut the door.
"Here you are, suh," he said, starting 
to put the yam into a bag.
"Never mind the bag, I'm going to eat 
it. Here . . ."
"Thanks." He took the dime. "If that 
ain't a sweet one, I'll give you
another one free of charge."
I knew that it was sweet before I broke 
it; bubbles of brown syrup
had burst the skin.
"Go ahead and break it," the old man 
said. "Break it and I'll give
you some butter since you gon' eat it 
right here. Lots of folks takes 'em
home. They got their own butter at 
home."

I broke it, seeing the sugary pulp 
steaming in the cold. "Hold it over
here," he said. He took a crock from a 
rack on the side of the wagon. "Right
here."
I held it, watching him pour a spoonful 
of melted butter over the
yam and the butter seeping in. "Thanks."
"You welcome. And I'll tell you 
something."
"What's that?" I said.
"If that ain't the best eating you had 
in a long time, I give you your
money back."
"You don't have to convince me," I 
said. "I can look at it and see it's
good."
"You right, but everything what looks 
good ain't necessarily good," he
said. "But these is."
I took a bite, finding it as sweet and 
hot as any I'd ever had, and
was overcome with such a surge of 
homesickness that I turned away to keep
my control. I walked along, munching 
the yam, just as suddenly overcome by
an intense feeling of freedom -- simply 
because I was eating while walking
along the street. It was exhilarating. 
I no longer had to worry about who saw
me or about what was proper. To hell 
with all that, and as sweet as the yam
actually was, it became like nectar 
with the thought. If only someone who
had known me at school or at home would 
come along and see me now.
How shocked they'd be! I'd push them 
into a side street and smear their
faces with the peel. What a group of 
people we were, I thought. Why, you
could cause us the greatest humiliation 
simply by confronting us with
something we liked. Not all of us, but 
so many. Simply by walking up and
shaking a set of chitterlings or a 
well-boiled hog maw at them during the
clear light of day! What consternation 
it would cause! And I saw myself
advancing upon Bledsoe, standing bare 
of his false humility in the crowded
lobby of Men's House, and seeing him 
there and him seeing me and ignoring
me and me enraged and suddenly whipping 
out a foot or two of chitterlings,
raw, uncleaned and dripping sticky 
circles on the floor as I shake them in 
his
face, shouting:
"Bledsoe, you're a shameless 
chitterling eater! I accuse you of
relishing how bowels! Ha! And not only 
do you eat them, you sneak and eat
them in private when you think you're 
unobserved! You're a sneaking

chitterling lover! I accuse you of 
indulging in a filthy habit, Bledsoe! 
Lug
them out of there, Bledsoe! Lug them 
out so we can see! I accuse you before
the eyes of the world!" And he lugs 
them out, yards of them, with mustard
greens, and racks of pigs' ears, and 
pork chops and black-eyed peas with dull
accusing eyes.
I let out a wild laugh, almost choking 
over the yam as the scene
spun before me. Why, with others 
present, it would be worse than if I had
accused him of raping an old woman of 
ninety-nine years, weighing ninety
pounds . . . blind in one eye and lame 
in the hip! Bledsoe would
disintegrate, disinflate! With a 
profound sigh he'd drop his head in 
shame.
He'd lose caste. The weekly newspapers 
would attack him. The captions over
his picture: Prominent Educator Reverts 
to Field Niggerism! His rivals would
denounce him as a bad example for the 
South. Editorials would demand that
he either recant or retire from public 
life. In the South his white folks would
desert him; he would be discussed far 
and wide, and all of the trustees'
money couldn't prop up his sagging 
prestige. He'd end up an exile washing
dishes at the Automat. For down South 
he'd be unable to get a job on the
honey wagon.
This is all very wild and childish, I 
thought, but to hell with being
ashamed of what you liked. No more of 
that for me. I am what I am! I
wolfed down the yam and ran back to the 
old man and handed him twenty
cents, "Give me two more," I said.
"Sho, all you want, long as I got 'em. 
I can see you a serious yam
eater, young fellow. You eating them 
right away?"
"As soon as you give them to me," I 
said.
"You want 'em buttered?"
"Please."
"Sho, that way you can get the most out 
of 'em. Yessuh," he said,
handing over the yams, "I can see you 
one of these old-fashioned yam
eaters."
"They're my birthmark," I said. "I yam 
what I am!"
"Then you must be from South Car'lina," 
he said with a grin.
"South Carolina nothing, where I come 
from we really go for yams."
"Come back tonight or tomorrow if you 
can eat some more," he
called after me. "My old lady'll be out 
here with some hot sweet potato fried

pies."
Hot fried pies, I thought sadly, moving 
away. I would probably have
indigestion if I ate one -- now that I 
no longer felt ashamed of the things I
had always loved, I probably could no 
longer digest very many of them. What
and how much had I lost by trying to do 
only what was expected of me
instead of what I myself had wished to 
do? What a waste, what a senseless
waste! But what of those things which 
you actually didn't like, not because
you were not supposed to like them, not 
because to dislike them was
considered a mark of refinement and 
education -- but because you actually
found them distasteful? The very idea 
annoyed me. How could you know? It
involved a problem of choice. I would 
have to weigh many things carefully
before deciding and there would be some 
things that would cause quite a bit
of trouble, simply because I had never 
formed a personal attitude toward so
much. I had accepted the accepted 
attitudes and it had made life seem 
simple
. . .
But not yams, I had no problem 
concerning them and I would eat
them whenever and wherever I took the 
notion. Continue on the yam level
and life would be sweet -- though 
somewhat yellowish. Yet the freedom to 
eat
yams on the street was far less than I 
had expected upon coming to the city.
An unpleasant taste bloomed in my mouth 
now as I bit the end of the yam
and threw it into the street; it had 
been frost-bitten.
The wind drove me into a side street 
where a group of boys had set
a packing box afire. The gray smoke 
hung low and seemed to thicken as I
walked with my head down and eyes 
closed, trying to avoid the fumes. My
lungs began to pain; then emerging, 
wiping my eyes and coughing, I almost
stumbled over it: It was piled in a 
jumble along the walk and over the curb
into the street, like a lot of junk 
waiting to be hauled away. Then I saw 
the
sullen-faced crowd, looking at a 
building where two white men were toting
out a chair in which an old woman sat; 
who, as I watched, struck at them
feebly with her fists. A 
motherly-looking old woman with her 
head tied in a
handkerchief, wearing a man's shoes and 
a man's heavy blue sweater. It was
startling: The crowd watching silently, 
the two white men lugging the chair
and trying to dodge the blows and the 
old woman's face streaming with angry
tears as she thrashed at them with her 
fists. I couldn't believe it. Something,
a sense of foreboding, filled me, a 
quick sense of uncleanliness.

"Leave us alone," she cried, "leave us 
alone!" as the men pulled their
heads out of range and sat her down 
abruptly at the curb, hurrying back into
the building.
What on earth, I thought, looking about 
me. What on earth? The old
woman sobbed, pointing to the stuff 
piled along the curb. "Just look what
they doing to us. Just look," looking 
straight at me. And I realized that what
I'd taken for junk was actually worn 
household furnishings.
"Just look at what they doing," she 
said, her teary eyes upon my
face.
I looked away embarrassed, staring into 
the rapidly growing crowd.
Faces were peering sullenly from the 
windows above. And now as the two
men reappeared at the top of the steps 
carrying a battered chest of drawers,
I saw a third man come out and stand 
behind them, pulling at his ear as he
looked out over the crowd.
"Shake it up, you fellows," he said, 
"shake it up. We don't have all
day."
Then the men came down with the chest 
and I saw the crowd give
way sullenly, the men trudging through, 
grunting and putting the chest at the
curb, then returning into the building 
without a glance to left or right.
"Look at that," a slender man near me 
said. "We ought to beat the
hell out of those paddies!"
I looked silently into his face, taut 
and ashy in the cold, his eyes
trained upon the men going up the steps.
"Sho, we ought to stop 'em," another 
man said, "but ain't that much
nerve in the whole bunch."
"There's plenty nerve," the slender man 
said. "All they need is
someone to set it off. All they need is 
a leader. You mean you don't have the
nerve."
"Who me?" the man said. "Who me?"
"Yes, you."
"Just look," the old woman said, "just 
look," her face still turned
toward mine. I turned away, edging 
closer to the two men.
"Who are those men?" I said, edging 
closer.
"Marshals or something. I don't give a 
damn who they is."
"Marshals, hell," another man said. 
"Those guys doing all the toting

ain't nothing but trusties. Soon as 
they get through they'll lock 'em up 
again."
"I don't care who they are, they got no 
business putting these old
folks out on the sidewalk."
"You mean they're putting them out of 
their apartment?" I said.
"They can do that up here?"
"Man, where you from?" he said, 
swinging toward me.
"What does it look like they puttin' 
them out of, a Pullman car?
They being evicted!"
I was embarrassed; others were turning 
to stare. I had never seen an
eviction. Someone snickered.
"Where did he come from?"
A flash of heat went over me and J 
turned. "Look, friends," I said,
hearing a hot edge coming into my 
voice. "I asked a civil question. If you
don't care to answer, don't, but don't 
try to make me look ridiculous."
"Ridiculous? Hell, all scobos is 
ridiculous. Who the hell is you?"
"Never mind, I am who I am. Just don't 
beat up your gums at me,"
I said, throwing him a newly acquired 
phrase.
Just then one of the men came down the 
steps with an armful of
articles, and I saw the old woman reach 
up, yelling, "Take your hands off my
Bible!" And the crowd surged forward.
The white man's hot eyes swept the 
crowd. "Where, lady?" he said. "I
don't see any Bible."
And I saw her snatch the Book from his 
arms, clutching it fiercely
and sending forth a shriek. "They can 
come in your home and do what they
want to you," she said. "Just come 
stomping in and jerk your life up by the
roots! But this here's the last straw. 
They ain't going to bother with my
Bible!"
The white man eyed the crowd. "Look, 
lady," he said, more to the
rest of us than to her, "I don't want 
to do this, I have to do it. They sent
me up here to do it. If it was left to 
me, you could stay here till hell 
freezes
over . . ."
"These white folks, Lord. These white 
folks," she moaned, her eyes
turned toward the sky, as an old man 
pushed past me and went to her.
"Hon, Hon," he said, placing his hand 
on her shoulder. "It's the
agent, not these gentlemen. He's the 
one; He says it's the bank, but you

know he's the one. We've done business 
with him for over twenty years."
"Don't tell me," she said. "It's all 
the white folks, not just one. They
all against us. Every stinking low-down 
one of them."
"She's right!" a hoarse voice said. 
"She's right! They all is!"
Something had been working fiercely 
inside me, and for a moment I
had forgotten the rest of the crowd. 
Now I recognized a selfconsciousness
about them, as though they, we, were 
ashamed to witness the eviction, as
though we were all unwilling intruders 
upon some shameful event; and thus
we were careful not to touch or stare 
too hard at the effects that lined the
curb; for we were witnesses of what we 
did not wish to see, though curious,
fascinated,

despite

our

shame,

and

through

it

all

the

old

female,

mind-plunging crying.
I looked at the old people, feeling my 
eyes burn, my throat tighten.
The old woman's sobbing was having a 
strange effect upon me-as when a
child, seeing the tears of its parents, 
is moved by both fear and sympathy to
cry. I turned away, feeling myself 
being drawn to the old couple by a warm,
dark, rising whirpool of emotion which 
I feared. I was wary of what the sight
of them crying there on the sidewalk 
was making me begin to feel. I wanted
to leave, but was too ashamed to leave, 
was rapidly becoming too much a
part of it to leave.
I turned aside and looked at the 
clutter of household objects which
the two men continued to pile on the 
walk. And as the crowd pushed me I
looked down to see looking out of an 
oval frame a portrait of the old couple
when young, seeing the sad, stiff 
dignity of the faces there; feeling 
strange
memories awakening that began an 
echoing in my head like that of a
hysterical voice stuttering in a dark 
street. Seeing them look back at me as
though even then in that 
nineteenth-century day they had 
expected little, and
this with a grim, unillusioned pride 
that suddenly seemed to me both a
reproach and a warning. My eyes fell 
upon a pair of crudely carved and
polished bones, "knocking bones," used 
to accompany music at country
dances, used in black-face minstrels; 
the flat ribs of a cow, a steer or 
sheep,
flat bones that gave off a sound, when 
struck, like heavy castanets (had he
been a minstrel?) or the wooden block 
of a set of drums. Pots and pots of
green plants were lined in the dirty 
snow, certain to die of the cold; ivy,
canna, a tomato plant. And in a basket 
I saw a straightening comb, switches

of false hair, a curling iron, a card 
with silvery letters against a 
background
of dark red velvet, reading "God Bless 
Our Home"; and scattered across the
top of a chiffonier were nuggets of 
High John the Conqueror, the lucky 
stone;
and as I watched the white men put down 
a basket in which I saw a
whiskey bottle filled with rock candy 
and camphor, a small Ethiopian flag, a
faded tintype of Abraham Lincoln, and 
the smiling image of a Hollywood star
torn from a magazine. And on a pillow 
several badly cracked pieces of
delicate china, a commemorative plate 
celebrating the St. Louis World Fair . .
. I stood in a kind of daze, looking at 
an old folded lace fan studded with jet
and mother-of-pearl.
The crowd surged as the white men came 
back, knocking over a
drawer that spilled its contents in the 
snow at my feet. I stooped and starting
replacing the articles: a bent Masonic 
emblem, a set of tarnished cuff links,
three brass rings, a dime pierced with 
a nail hole so as to be worn about the
ankle on a string for luck, an ornate 
greeting card with the message
"Grandma, I love you" in childish 
scrawl; another card with a picture of 
what
looked like a white man in black-face 
seated in the door of a cabin
strumming a banjo beneath a bar of 
music and the lyric "Going back to my
old cabin home"; a useless inhalant, a 
string of bright glass beads with a
tarnished clasp, a rabbit foot, a 
celluloid baseball scoring card shaped 
like a
catcher's mitt, registering a game won 
or lost years ago; an old breast pump
with rubber bulb yellowed with age, a 
worn baby shoe and a dusty lock of
infant hair tied with a faded and 
crumpled blue ribbon. I felt nauseated. 
In
my hand I held three lapsed life 
insurance policies with perforated seals
stamped "Void"; a yellowing newspaper 
portrait of a huge black man with the
caption: MARCUS GARVEY DEPORTED.
I turned away, bending and searching 
the dirty snow for anything
missed by my eyes, and my fingers 
closed upon something resting in a 
frozen
footstep: a fragile paper, coming apart 
with age, written in black ink grown
yellow. I read: FREE PAPERS. Be it 
known to all men that my negro, Primus
Provo, has been freed by me this sixth 
day of August, 1859. Signed: John
Samuels Macon . . . I folded it 
quickly, blotting out the single drop 
of melted
snow which glistened on the yellowed 
page, and dropped it back into the
drawer. My hands were trembling, my 
breath rasping as if I had run a long
distance or come upon a coiled snake in 
a busy street. It has been longer

than that, further removed in time, I 
told myself, and yet I knew that it
hadn't been. I replaced the drawer in 
the chest and pushed drunkenly to the
curb.
But it wouldn't come up, only a bitter 
spurt of gall filled my mouth
and splattered the old folk's 
possessions. I turned and stared again 
at the
jumble,

no

longer

looking

at

what

was

before

my

eyes,

but

inwardly-outwardly, around a corner 
into the dark, far-away-and-long-ago, 
not
so much of my own memory as of 
remembered words, of linked verbal
echoes, images, heard even when not 
listening at home. And it was as though
I myself was being dispossessed of some 
painful yet precious thing which I
could not bear to lose; something 
confounding, like a rotted tooth that 
one
would rather suffer indefinitely than 
endure the short, violent eruption of 
pain
that would mark its removal. And with 
this sense of dispossession came a
pang of vague recognition: this junk, 
these shabby chairs, these heavy,
old-fashioned pressing irons, zinc wash 
tubs with dented bottoms -- all
throbbed within me with more meaning 
than there should have been: And
why did I, standing in the crowd, see 
like a vision my mother hanging wash
on a cold windy day, so cold that the 
warm clothes froze even before the
vapor thinned and hung stiff on the 
line, and her hands white and raw in
the skirt-swirling wind and her gray 
head bare to the darkened sky -- why
were they causing me discomfort so far 
beyond their intrinsic meaning as
objects? And why did I see them now as 
behind a veil that threatened to lift,
stirred by the cold wind in the narrow 
street?
A scream, "I'm going in!" spun me 
around. The old couple were on
the steps now, the old man holding her 
arm, the white men leaning forward
above, and the crowd pressing me closer 
to the steps.
"You can't go in, lady," the man said.
"I want to pray!" she said.
"I can't help it, lady. You'll have to 
do your praying out here."
"I'm go'n in!"
"Not in here!"
"All we want to do is go in and pray," 
she said, clutching her Bible.
"It ain't right to pray in the street 
like this."
"I'm sorry," he said.
"Aw, let the woman go in to pray," a 
voice called from the crowd.

"You got all their stuff out here on 
the walk -- what more do you want,
blood?"
"Sure, let them old folks pray."
"That's what's wrong with us now, all 
this damn praying," another
voice called.
"You don't go back, see," the white man 
said. "You were legally
evicted."
"But all we want to do is go in an' 
kneel on the floor," the old man
said. "We been living right here for 
over twenty years. I don't see why you
can't let us go just for a few minutes 
. . ."
"Look, I've told you," the man said. 
"I've got my orders. You're
wasting my time."
"We're go'n in!" the woman said.
It happened so suddenly that I could 
barely keep up with it: I saw
the old woman clutching her Bible and 
rushing up the steps, her husband
behind her and the white man stepping 
in front of them and stretching out
his arm. "I'll jug you," he yelled, "by 
God, I'll jug you!"
"Take your hands off that woman!" 
someone called from the crowd.
Then at the top of the stairs they were 
pushing against the man and
I saw the old woman fall backwards, and 
the crowd exploded.
"Get that paddie sonofabitch!"
"He struck her!" a West Indian woman 
screamed into my ear. "The
filthy brute, he struck her!"
"Stand back or I'll shoot," the man 
called, his eyes wild as he drew a
gun and backed into the doorway where 
the two trusties stood bewildered,
their arms full of articles. "I swear 
I'll shoot! You don't know what you're
doing, but I'll shoot!"
They hesitated. "Ain't but six bullets 
in that thing," a little fellow
called. "Then what you going to do?"
"Yeah, you damn sho caint hide."
"I advise you to stay out of this," the 
marshal called.
"Think you can come up here and hit one 
of our women, you a
fool."
"To hell with all this talk, let's rush 
that bastard!"
"You better think twice," the white man 
called.

I saw them start up the steps and felt 
suddenly as though my head
would split. I knew that they were 
about to attack the man and I was both
afraid and angry, repelled and 
fascinated. I both wanted it and feared 
the
consequences, was outraged and angered 
at what I saw and yet surged with
fear; not for the man or of the 
consequences of an attack, but of what 
the
sight of violence might release in me. 
And beneath it all there boiled up all
the shock-absorbing phrases that I had 
learned all my life. I seemed to totter
on the edge of a great dark hole.
"No, no," I heard myself yelling. 
"Black men! Brothers! Black
Brothers! That's not the way. We're 
law-abiding. We're a law-abiding people
and a slow-to-anger people."
Forcing my way quickly through the 
crowd, I stood on the steps
facing those in front, talking rapidly 
without thought but out of my clashing
emotions. "We're a law-abiding people 
and a slow-to-anger people . . ." They
stopped, listening. Even the white man 
was startled.
"Yeah, but we mad now," a voice called 
out.
"Yes, you're right," I called back. 
"We're angry, but let us be wise.
Let us, I mean let us not . . . Let us 
learn from that great leader whose wise
action was reported in the newspaper 
the other day . . ."
"What, mahn? Who?" a West Indian voice 
shouted.
"Come on! To hell with this guy, let's 
get that paddie before they
send him some help . . ."
"No, wait," I yelled. "Let's follow a 
leader, let's organize. Organize.
We need someone like that wise leader, 
you read about him, down in
Alabama. He was strong enough to choose 
to do the wise thing in spite of
what he felt himself . . ."
"Who, mahn? Who?"
This was it, I thought, they're 
listening, eager to listen.
Nobody laughed. If they laugh, I'll 
die! I tensed my diaphragm.
"That wise man," I said, "you read 
about him, who when that fugitive
escaped from the mob and ran to his 
school for protection, that wise man
who was strong enough to do the legal 
thing, the law-abiding thing, to turn
him over to the forces of law and order 
. . ."
"Yeah," a voice rang out, "yeah, so 
they could lynch his ass."
Oh, God, this wasn't it at all. Poor 
technique and not at all what I

intended.
"He was a wise leader," I yelled. "He 
was within the law. Now wasn't
that the wise thing to do?"
"Yeah, he was wise all right," the man 
laughed angrily. "Now get out
of the way so we can jump this paddie."
The crowd yelled and I laughed in 
response as though hypnotized.
"But wasn't that the human thing to do? 
After all, he had to protect
himself because --"
"He was a handkerchief-headed rat!" a 
woman screamed, her voice
boiling with contempt.
"Yes, you're right. He was wise and 
cowardly, but what about us?
What are we to do?" I yelled, suddenly 
thrilled by the response. "Look at
him," I cried.
"Yes, just look at him!" an old fellow 
in a derby called out as though
answering a preacher in church.
"And look at that old couple . . ."
"Yeah, what about Sister and Brother 
Provo?" he said. "It's an
ungodly shame!"
"And look at their possessions all 
strewn there on the sidewalk. Just
look at their possessions in the snow. 
How old are you, sir?" I yelled.
"I'm eighty-seven," the old man said, 
his voice low and bewildered.
"How's that? Yell so our slow-to-anger 
brethren can hear you."
"I'm eighty-seven years old!"
"Did you hear him? He's eighty-seven. 
Eighty-seven and look at all
he's accumulated in eighty-seven years, 
strewn in the snow like chicken guts,
and we're a law-abiding, slow-to-anger 
bunch of folks turning the other cheek
every day in the week. What are we 
going to do? What would you, what
would I, what would he have done? What 
is to be done? I propose we do
the wise thing, the law-abiding thing. 
Just look at this junk! Should two old
folks live in such junk, cooped up in a 
filthy room? It's a great danger, a fire
hazard! Old cracked dishes and 
broken-down chairs. Yes, yes, yes! Look 
at
that old woman, somebody's mother, 
somebody's grandmother, maybe. We call
them 'Big Mama' and they spoil us and 
-- you know, you remember . . .
Look at her quilts and broken-down 
shoes. I know she's somebody's mother
because I saw an old breast pump fall 
into the snow, and she's somebody's

grandmother, because I saw a card that 
read 'Dear Grandma' . . . But we're
law-abiding . . . I looked into a 
basket and I saw some bones, not 
neckbones,
but rib bones,

knocking bones . . . This old couple 
used to dance . . . I saw

-- What kind of work do you do, 
Father?" I called.
"I'm a day laborer . . ."
". . . A day laborer, you heard him, 
but look at his stuff strewn like
chitterlings in the snow . . . Where 
has all his labor gone? Is he lying?"
"Hell, no, he ain't lying."
"Naw, suh!"
"Then where did his labor go? Look at 
his old blues records and her
pots of plants, they're down-home 
folks, and everything tossed out like 
junk
whirled eighty-seven years in a 
cyclone. Eighty-seven years, and poof! 
like a
snort in a windstorm. Look at them, 
they look like my mama and papa and
my grandma and grandpa, and I look like 
you and you look like me. Look at
them but remember that we're a wise, 
law-abiding group of people. And
remember it when you look up there in 
the doorway at that law standing
there with his forty-five. Look at him, 
standing with his blue steel pistol and
his blue serge suit. Look at him! You 
don't see just one man dressed in one
blue serge suit, or one forty-five, you 
see ten for every one of us, ten guns
and ten warm suits and ten fat bellies 
and ten million laws. Laws, that's what
we call them down South! Laws! And 
we're wise, and law-abiding. And look
at this old woman with her dog-eared 
Bible. What's she trying to bring off
here? She's let her religion go to her 
head, but we all know that religion is
for the heart, not for the head. 
'Blessed are the pure in heart,' it 
says.
Nothing about the poor in head. What's 
she trying to do? What about the
clear of head? And the clear of eye, 
the ice-water-visioned who see too clear
to miss a lie? Look out there at her 
cabinet with its gaping drawers.
Eighty-seven years to fill them, and 
full of brick and brack, a bric-a-brac, 
and
she wants to break the law . . . What's 
happened to them? They're our
people, your people and mine, your 
parents and mine. What's happened to
'em?"
"I'll tell you!" a heavyweight yelled, 
pushing out of the crowd, his
face angry. "Hell, they been 
dispossessed, you crazy sonofabitch, 
get out the
way!"
"Dispossessed?" I cried, holding up my 
hand and allowing the word

to whistle from my throat. "That's a 
good word, 'Dispossessed'! 
'Dispossessed,'
eighty-seven years and dispossessed of 
what? They ain't got nothing, they
caint get nothing, they never had 
nothing. So who was dispossessed?" I
growled. "We're law-abiding. So who's 
being dispossessed? Can it be us?
These old ones are out in the snow, but 
we're here with them. Look at their
stuff, not a pit to hiss in, nor a 
window to shout the news and us right 
with
them. Look at them, not a shack to pray 
in or an alley to sing the blues!
They're facing a gun and we're facing 
it with them. They don't want the
world, but only Jesus. They only want 
Jesus, just fifteen minutes of Jesus on
the rug-bare floor . . . How about it, 
Mr. Law? Do we get our fifteen minutes
worth of Jesus? You got the world, can 
we have our Jesus?"
"I got my orders, Mac," the man called, 
waving the pistol with a
sneer. "You're doing all right, tell 
'em to keep out of this. This is legal 
and
I'll shoot if I have to . . ."
"But what about the prayer?"
"They don't go back!"
"Are you positive?"
"You could bet your life," he said.
"Look at him," I called to the angry 
crowd. "With his blue steel
pistol and his blue serge suit. You 
heard him, he's the law. He says he'll
shoot

us

down

because

we're

a

law-abiding

people.

So

we've

been

dispossessed, and what's more, he 
thinks he's God. Look up there backed
against the post with a criminal on 
either side of him. Can't you feel the 
cold
wind, can't you hear it asking, 'What 
did you do with your heavy labor?
What did you do?' When you look at all 
you haven't got in eighty-seven years
you feel ashamed --"
"Tell 'em about it, brother," an old 
man interrupted. "It makes you
feel you ain't a man."
"Yes, these old folks had a dream book, 
but the pages went blank
and it failed to give them the number. 
It was called the Seeing Eye, The
Great Constitutional Dream Book, The 
Secrets of Africa, The Wisdom of Egypt
-- but the eye was blind, it lost its 
luster. It's all cataracted like a 
cross-eyed
carpenter and it doesn't saw straight. 
All we have is the Bible and this Law
here rules that out. So where do we go? 
Where do we go from here, without
a pot --"

"We going after that paddie," the 
heavyweight called, rushing up the
steps.
Someone pushed me. "No, wait," I called.
"Get out the way now."
There was a rush against me and I fell, 
hearing a single explosion,
backward into a whirl of milling legs, 
overshoes, the trampled snow cold on
my hands. Another shot sounded above 
like a bursting bag. Managing to
stand, I saw atop the steps the fist 
with the gun being forced into the air
above the crowd's bobbing heads and the 
next instant they were dragging him
down into the snow; punching him left 
and right, uttering a low tense
swelling sound of desperate effort; a 
grunt that exploded into a thousand
softly spat, hate-sizzling curses. I 
saw a woman striking with the pointed 
heel
of her shoe, her face a blank mask with 
hollow black eyes as she aimed and
struck, aimed and struck, bringing 
spurts of blood, running along beside 
the
man who was dragged to his feet now as 
they punched him gauntlet-wise
between them. Suddenly I saw a pair of 
handcuffs arc gleaming into the air
and sail across the street. A boy broke 
out of the crowd, the marshal's
snappy hat on his head. The marshal was 
spun this way and that, then a
swift tattoo of blows started him down 
the street. I was beside myself with
excitement. The crowd surged after him, 
milling like a huge man trying to
turn in a cubbyhole -- some of them 
laughing, some cursing, some intently
silent.
"The brute struck that gentle woman, 
poor thing!" the West Indian
woman chanted. "Black men, did you ever 
see such a brute? Is he a
gentleman, I ask you? The brute! Give 
it back to him, black men. Repay the
brute a thousandfold! Give it back to 
him unto the third and fourth
generations. Strike him, our fine black 
men. Protect your black women! Repay
the arrogant creature to the third and 
fourth generations!"
"We're dispossessed," I sang at the top 
of my voice, "dispossessed
and we want to pray. Let's go in and 
pray. Let's have a big prayer meeting.
But we'll need some chairs to sit in . 
. . rest upon as we kneel. We'll need
some chairs!"
"Here's some chairs down here," a woman 
called from the walk.
"How 'bout taking in some chairs?"
"Sure," I called, "take everything. 
Take it all, hide that junk! Put it

back where it came from. It's blocking 
the street and the sidewalk, and that's
against the law. We're law-abiding, so 
clear the street of the debris. Put it 
out
of sight! Hide it, hide their shame! 
Hide our shame!
"Come on, men," I yelled, dashing down 
the steps and seizing a chair
and starting back, no longer struggling 
against or thinking about the nature of
my action. The others followed, picking 
up pieces of furniture and lugging
them back into the building.
"We ought to done this long ago," a man 
said.
"We damn sho should."
"I feel so good," a woman said, "I feel 
so good!"
"Black men, I'm proud of you," the West 
Indian woman shrilled.
"Proud!"
We rushed into the dark little 
apartment that smelled of stale
cabbage and put the pieces down and 
returned for more. Men, women and
children seized articles and dashed 
inside shouting, laughing. I looked for 
the
two trusties, but they seemed to have 
disappeared. Then, coming down into
the street, I thought I saw one. He was 
carrying a chair back inside.
"So you're law-abiding too," I called 
only to become aware that it
was someone else. A white man but 
someone else altogether.
The man laughed at me and continued 
inside. And when I reached
the street there were several of them, 
men and women, standing about,
cheering whenever another piece of 
furniture was returned. It was like a
holiday. I didn't want it to stop.
"Who are those people?" I called from 
the steps.
"What people?" someone called back.
"Those," I said, pointing.
"You mean those ofays?"
"Yes, what do they want?"
"We're friends of the people," one of 
the white men called.
"Friends of what people?" I called, 
prepared to jump down upon him
if he answered, "You people."
"We're friends of all the common 
people," he shouted. "We came up
to help."
"We believe in brotherhood," another 
called.
"Well, pick up that sofa and come on," 
I called. I was uneasy about

their presence and disappointed when 
they all joined the crowd and started
lugging the evicted articles back 
inside. Where had I heard of them?
"Why don't we stage a march?" one of 
the white men called, going
past.
"Why don't we march!" I yelled out to 
the sidewalk before I had
time to think.
They took it up immediately.
"Let's march . . ."
"It's a good idea."
"Let's have a demonstration . . ."
"Let's parade!"
I heard the siren and saw the scout 
cars swing into the block in the
same instant. It was the police! I 
looked into the crowd, trying to focus 
upon
their

faces,

hearing

someone

yell,

"Here

come

the

cops,"

and

others

answering, "Let 'em come!"
Where is all this leading? I thought, 
seeing a white man run inside
the building as the policemen dashed 
from their cars and came running up.
"What's going on here?" a gold-shield 
officer called up the steps.
It had become silent. No one answered.
"I said, what's going on here," he 
repeated. "You," he called, pointing
straight at me.
"We've . . . we've been clearing the 
sidewalk of a lot of junk," I
called, tense inside.
"What's that?" he said.
"It's a clean-up campaign," I called, 
wanting to laugh. "These old
folks had all their stuff cluttering up 
the sidewalk and we cleared the street .
. ."
"You mean you're interfering with an 
eviction," he called, starting
through the crowd.
"He ain't doing nothing," a woman 
called from behind me.
I looked around, the steps behind were 
filled with those who had
been inside.
"We're all together," someone called, 
as the crowd closed in.
"Clear the streets," the officer 
ordered.
"That's what we were doing," someone 
called from back in the crowd.

"Mahoney!" he bellowed to another 
policeman, "send in a riot call!"
"What riot?" one of the white men 
called to him. "There's no riot."
"If I say there's a riot, there's a 
riot," the officer said. "And what are
you white people doing up here in 
Harlem?"
"We're citizens. We go anywhere we 
like."
"Listen! Here come some more cops!" 
someone called.
"Let them come!"
"Let the Commissioner come!"
It became too much for me. The whole 
thing had gotten out of hand.
What had I said to bring on all this? I 
edged to the back of the crowd on
the steps and backed into the hallway. 
Where would I go? I hurried up to
the old couple's apartment. But I can't 
hide here, I thought, heading back for
the stairs.
"No. You can't go that way," a voice 
said.
I whirled. It was a white girl standing 
in the door.
"What are you doing in here?" I 
shouted, my fear turning to feverish
anger.
"I didn't mean to startle you," she 
said. "Brother, that was quite a
speech you made. I heard just the end 
of it, but you certainly moved them to
action . . ."
"Action," I said, "action --"
"Don't be modest, brother," she said, 
"I heard you."
"Look, Miss, we'd better get out of 
here," I said, finally controlling
the throbbing in my throat. "There are 
a lot of policemen downstairs and
more coming."
"Oh, yes. You'd better go over the 
roof," she said. "Otherwise,
someone is sure to point you out."
"Over the roof?"
"It's easy. Just go up to the roof of 
the building and keep crossing
until you reach the house at the end of 
the block. Then open the door and
walk down as though you've been 
visiting. You'd better hurry. The 
longer you
remain unknown to the police, the 
longer you'll be effective."
Effective? I thought. What did she 
mean? And what was this
"brother" business?
"Thanks," I said, and hurried for the 
stairs.

"Good-bye," her voice rose fluidly 
behind me. I turned, glimpsing her
white face in the dim light of the 
darkened doorway.
I took the flight in a bound and 
cautiously opened the door, and
suddenly the sun flared on the roof and 
it was windy cold. Before me the
low, snow-caked walls dividing the 
buildings stretched hurdle-like the long
length of the block to the corner, and 
before me empty clotheslines trembled
in the wind. I made my way through the 
wind-carved snow to the next roof
and then to the next, going with swift 
caution. Planes were rising over an
airfield far to the southeast, and I 
was running now and seeing all the 
church
steeples rising and falling and stacks 
with smoke leaning sharp against the
sky, and below in the street the sound 
of sirens and shouting. I hurried.
Then, climbing over a wall I looked 
back, seeing a man hurrying after me,
slipping, sliding, going over the low 
dividing walls of the roofs with 
puffing,
bustling effort. I turned and ran, 
trying to put the rows of chimneys 
between
us, wondering why he didn't yell 
"Halt!" or shout, or shoot. I ran, 
dodging
behind an elevator housing, then 
dashing to the next roof, going down, 
the
snow cold to my hands, knees striking, 
toes gripping, and up and running
and looking back, seeing the short 
figure in black still running after. The
corner seemed a mile away. I tried to 
count the number of roofs that
bounced before me yet to be crossed. 
Getting to seven, I ran, hearing shouts,
more sirens, and looking back and him 
still behind me, running in a
short-legged scramble, still behind me 
as I tried to open the door of a
building to go down and finding it 
stuck and running once more, trying to
zig-zag in the snow and feeling the 
crunch of gravel underneath, and behind
me still, as I swung over a partition 
and went brushing past a huge cote and
arousing a flight of frantic white 
birds, suddenly as large as buzzards as 
they
beat furiously against my eyes, 
dazzling the sun as they fluttered up 
and away
and around in a furious glide and me 
running again and looking back and
for a split second thinking him gone 
and once more seeing him bobbing
after. Why doesn't he shoot? Why? If 
only it were like at home where I knew
someone in all the houses, knew them by 
sight and by name, by blood and
by background, by shame and pride, and 
by religion.
It was a carpeted hall and I moved down 
with pounding heart as a
dog set up a terrific din within the 
top apartment. Then I moved quickly, my
body like glass inside as I skipped 
downward off the edges of the stairs.

Looking down the stairwell I saw pale 
light filtering through the door glass,
far below. But what had happened to the 
girl, had she put the man on my
trail? What was she doing there? I 
bounded down, no one challenging me,
and I stopped in the vestibule, 
breathing deeply and listening for his 
hand
upon the door above and brushing my 
clothing into order. Then I stepped
into the street with a nonchalance 
copied from characters I had seen in the
movies. No sound from above, not even 
the malicious note of the barking
dog.
It was a long block and I had come down 
into a building that faced
not the street but the avenue. A squad 
of mounted policemen lashed
themselves around the corner and 
galloped past, the horseshoes thudding
dully through the snow, the men rising 
high in their saddles, shouting. I
picked up speed, careful not to run, 
heading away. This was awful. What on
earth had I said to have brought on all 
this? How would it end? Someone
might be killed. Heads would be 
pistol-whipped. I stopped at the corner,
looking for the pursuing man, the 
detective, and for a bus. The long white
stretch of street was empty, the 
aroused pigeons still circling 
overhead. I
scanned the roofs, expecting to see him 
peering down. The sound of shouting
continued to rise, then another green 
and white patrol car was whining
around the corner and speeding past me, 
heading for the block. I cut through
a block in which there were close to a 
dozen funeral parlors, each decked out
with neon signs, all set up in old 
brownstone buildings. Elaborate funeral 
cars
stood along the curb, one a dull black 
with windows shaped like Gothic
arches, through which I saw funeral 
flowers piled upon a casket. I hurried 
on.
I could see the girl's face still, 
below the short flight of stairs. But
who was the figure that had crossed the 
roof behind me? Chased me? Why
had he been so silent, and why was 
there only one? Yes, and why hadn't
they sent a patrol car to pick me up? I 
hurried out of the block of funeral
parlors into the bright sun that swept 
the snow of the avenue, slowing to a
leisurely walk now, trying to give the 
impression of a complete lack of haste.
I longed to look stupid, utterly 
incapable of thought or speech, and 
tried to
shuffle my feet over the walk, but quit 
with distaste after stealing a glance
behind me. Just ahead I saw a car pull 
up and a man leap out with a
physician's bag.
"Hurry, Doctor," a man called from the 
stoop, "she's already in

labor!"
"Good," the doctor called. "That's what 
we've been waiting for, isn't
it?"
"Yeah, but it didn't start when we 
expected it."
I watched them disappear inside the 
hall. What a hell of a time to
be born, I thought. At the corner I 
joined several people waiting for the
lights to change. I had just about 
convinced myself that I had escaped
successfully when a quiet, penetrating 
voice beside me said, "That was a
masterful bit of persuasion, brother."
Suddenly

wound

tight

as

a

tensioned

spring

I

turned

almost

lethargically. A short 
insignificant-looking bushy-eyebrowed 
man, with a quiet
smile on his face stood beside me, 
looking not at all like a policeman.
"What do you mean?" I asked, my voice 
lazy, distant.
"Don't be alarmed," he said, "I'm a 
friend."
"I've got nothing to be alarmed about, 
and you're no friend of mine."
"Then say that I'm an admirer," he said 
pleasantly.
"Admirer of what?"
"Of your speech," he said. "I was 
listening."
"What speech? I made no speech," I said.
He smiled knowingly. "I can see that 
you have been well trained.
Come, it isn't good for you to be seen 
with me in the street. Let's go
somewhere for a cup of coffee."
Something told me to refuse, but I was 
intrigued and, underneath it
all, was probably flattered. Besides, 
if I refused to go, it would be taken as
an admission of guilt. And he didn't 
look like a policeman or a detective. I
went silently beside him to a cafeteria 
down near the end of the block, seeing
him peer inside through the window 
before we entered.
"You get the table, brother. Over there 
near the wall where we can
talk in peace. I'll get the coffee."
I watched him going across the floor 
with a bouncy, rolling step,
then found a table and sat watching 
him. It was warm in the cafeteria. It
was late afternoon now only a few 
customers were scattered at the tables. 
I
watched the man going familiarly to the 
food counter and ordering. His
movements, as he peered through the 
brightly lighted shelves of pastry, were
those of a lively small animal, a fyce, 
interested in detecting only the target

cut of cake. So he's heard my speech; 
well, I'll hear what he has to say, I
thought,

seeing

him

start

toward

me

with

his

rapid,

rolling,

bouncy,

heel-and-toey step. It was as though he 
had taught himself to walk that way
and I had a feeling that somehow he was 
acting a part; that something about
him wasn't exactly real -- an idea 
which I dismissed immediately, since 
there
was a quality of unreality over the 
whole afternoon. He came straight to the
table without having to look about for 
me, as though he had expected me to
take that particular table and no other 
-- although many tables were vacant.
He was balancing a plate of cake on top 
of each cup, setting them down
deftly and shoving one toward me as he 
took his chair.
"I thought you might like a piece of 
cheese cake," he said.
"Cheese cake?" I said. "I've never 
heard of it."
"It's nice. Sugar?"
"Go ahead," I said.
"No, after you, brother."
I looked at him, then poured three 
spoonfuls and shoved the shaker
toward him. I was tense again.
"Thanks," I said, repressing an impulse 
to call him down about the
"brother" business.
He smiled, cutting into his cheese cake 
with a fork and shoving far
too large a piece into his mouth. His 
manners are extremely crude, I thought,
trying to put him at a disadvantage in 
my own mind by pointedly taking a
small piece of the cheesy stuff and 
placing it neatly into my mouth.
"You know," he said, taking a gulp of 
coffee, "I haven't heard such
an effective piece of eloquence since 
the days when I was in -- well, in a
long time. You aroused them so quickly 
to action. I don't understand how
you managed it. If only some of our 
speakers could have listened! With a few
words you had them involved in action! 
Others would have still been wasting
time with empty verbiage. I want to 
thank you for a most instructive
experience!"
I drank my coffee silently. Not only 
did I distrust him, I didn't know
how much I could safely say.
"The cheese cake here is good," he said 
before I could answer. "It's
really very good. By the way, where did 
you learn to speak?"
"Nowhere," I said, much too quickly.

"Then you're very talented. You are a 
natural. It's hard to believe."
"I was simply angry," I said, deciding 
to admit this much in order to
see what he would reveal.
"Then your anger was skillfully 
controlled. It had eloquence. Why was
that?"
"Why? I suppose I felt sorry -- I don't 
know. Maybe I just felt like
making a speech. There was the crowd 
waiting, so I said a few words. You
might not believe it, but I didn't know 
what I was going to say . . ."
"Please," he said, with a knowing smile.
"What do you mean?" I said.
"You try to sound cynical, but I see 
through you. I know, I listened
very carefully to what you had to say. 
You were enormously moved. Your
emotions were touched."
"I guess so," I said. "Maybe seeing 
them reminded me of something."
He leaned forward, watching me 
intensely now, the smile still on his
lips.
"Did it remind you of people you know?"
"I guess it did," I said.
"I think I understand. You were 
watching a death --"
I dropped my fork. "No one was killed," 
I said tensely. "What are
you trying to do?"
"A Death on the City Pavements -- 
that's the title of a detective story
or

something

I

read

somewhere

.

.

."

He

laughed.

"I

only

mean

meta-phor-ically speaking. They're 
living, but dead. Dead-in-living . . . 
a unity
of opposites."
"Oh," I said. What kind of double talk 
was this?
"The old ones, they're agrarian types, 
you know. Being ground up by
industrial conditions. Thrown on the 
dump heaps and cast aside. You pointed
it out very well. 'Eighty-seven years 
and nothing to show for it,' you said. 
You
were absolutely correct."
"I suppose that seeing them like that 
made me feel pretty bad," I
said.
"Yes, of course. And you made an 
effective speech. But you musn't
waste your emotions on individuals, 
they don't count."
"Who doesn't count?" I said.

"Those old ones," he said grimly. "It's 
sad, yes. But they're already
dead, defunct. History has passed them 
by. Unfortunate, but there's nothing
to do about them. They're like dead 
limbs that must be pruned away so that
the tree may bear young fruit or the 
storms of history will blow them down
anyway. Better the storm should hit 
them --"
"But look --"
"No, let me continue. These people are 
old. Men grow old and types
of men grow old. And these are very 
old. All they have left is their 
religion.
That's all they can think about. So 
they'll be cast aside. They're dead, you
see, because they're incapable of 
rising to the necessity of the 
historical
situation."
"But I like them," I said. "I like 
them, they reminded me of folks I
know down South. It's taken me a long 
time to feel it, but they're folks just
like me, except that I've been to 
school a few years."
He wagged his round red head. "Oh, no, 
brother; you're mistaken
and you're sentimental. You're not like 
them. Perhaps you were, but you're
not any longer. Otherwise you'd never 
have made that speech. Perhaps you
were, but that's all past, dead. You 
might not recognize it just now, but 
that
part of you is dead! You have not 
completely shed that self, that old 
agrarian
self, but it's dead and you will throw 
it off completely and emerge something
new. History has been born in your 
brain."
"Look," I said, "I don't know what 
you're talking about. I've never
lived on a farm and I didn't study 
agriculture, but I do know why I made
that speech."
"Then why?"
"Because I was upset over seeing those 
old folks put out in the
street, that's why. I don't care what 
you call it, I was angry."
He shrugged. "Let's not argue about 
it," he said. "I've a notion you
could do it again. Perhaps you would be 
interested in working for us."
"For whom?" I asked, suddenly excited. 
What was he trying to do?
"With our organization. We need a good 
speaker for this district.
Someone who can articulate the 
grievances of the people," he said.
"But nobody cares about their 
grievances," I said. "Suppose they were
articulated, who would listen or care?"
"They exist," he said with his knowing 
smile. "They exist, and when

the cry of protest is sounded, there 
are those who will hear it and act."
There was something mysterious and smug 
in the way he spoke, as
though he had everything figured out -- 
whatever he was talking about. Look
at this very most certain white man, I 
thought. He didn't even realize that I
was afraid and yet he speaks so 
confidently. I got to my feet, "I'm 
sorry," I
said, "I have a job and I'm not 
interested in anyone's grievances but 
my own
. . ."
"But you were concerned with that old 
couple," he said with
narrowed eyes. "Are they relatives of 
yours?"
"Sure, we're all black," I said, 
beginning to laugh.
He smiled, his eyes intense upon my 
face.
"Seriously, are they your relatives?"
"Sure, we were burned in the same 
oven," I said.
The effect was electric. "Why do you 
fellows always talk in terms of
race!" he snapped, his eyes blazing.
"What other terms do you know?" I said, 
puzzled. "You think I
would have been around there if they 
had been white?"
He threw up his hands and laughed. 
"Let's not argue that now," he
said. "You were very effective in 
helping them. I can't believe that 
you're such
an individualist as you pretend. You 
appeared to be a man who knew his
duty toward the people and performed it 
well. Whatever you think about it
personally, you were a spokesman for 
your people and you have a duty to
work in their interest."
He was too complicated for me. "Look, 
my friend, thanks for the
coffee and cake. I have no more 
interest in those old folks than in 
your job.
I wanted to make a speech. I like to 
make speeches. What happened
afterwards is a mystery to me. You 
picked the wrong man. You should have
stopped one of those fellows who 
started yelling at the policemen . . ." 
I
stood up.
"Wait a second," he said, producing a 
piece of envelope and
scribbling something. "You might change 
your mind. As for those others, I
know them already."
I looked at the white paper in his 
extended hand.
"You are wise to distrust me," he said. 
"You don't know who I am
and you don't trust me. That's as it 
should be. But I don't give up hope,

because some day you will look me up on 
your own accord and it will be
different, for then you'll be ready. 
Just call this number and ask for 
Brother
Jack. You needn't give me your name, 
just mention our conversation. Should
you decide tonight, give me a ring 
about eight."
"Okay," I said, taking the paper. "I 
doubt if I'll ever need it, but who
knows?"
"Well, you think about it, brother. 
Times are grave and you seem
very indignant."
"I only wanted to make a speech," I 
said again.
"But you were indignant. And sometimes 
the difference between
individual and organized indignation is 
the difference between criminal and
political action," he said.
I laughed, "So what? I'm neither a 
criminal nor a politician, brother.
So you picked the wrong man. But thanks 
again for the coffee and cheese
cake -- brother."
I left him sitting with a quiet smile 
on his face. When I had crossed
the avenue I looked through the glass, 
seeing him still there, and it occurred
to me that he was the same man who had 
followed me over the roof. He
hadn't been chasing me at all but only 
going in the same direction. I hadn't
understood much of what he had said, 
only that he had spoken with great
confidence. Anyway, I had been the 
better runner. Perhaps it was a trick of
some kind. He gave the impression that 
he understood much and spoke out
of a knowledge far deeper than appeared 
on the surface of his words.
Perhaps it was only the knowledge that 
he had escaped by the same route as
I. But what had he to fear? I had made 
the speech, not he. That girl in the
apartment had said that the longer I 
remained unseen the longer I'd be
effective, which didn't make much sense 
either. But perhaps that was why he
had run. He wanted to remain unseen and 
effective. Effective at what? No
doubt he was laughing at me. I must 
have looked silly hurtling across the
roofs, and like a black-face comedian 
shrinking from a ghost when the white
pigeons shot up around me. To hell with 
him. He needn't be so smug, I
knew of some things he didn't know. Let 
him find someone else. He only
wanted to use me for something. 
Everybody wanted to use you for some
purpose. Why should he want me as a 
speaker? Let him make his own
speeches. I headed for home, feeling a 
growing satisfaction that I had

dismissed him so completely.
It was turning dark now, and much 
colder. Colder than I had ever
known. What on earth was it, I mused, 
bending my head to the wind, that
made us leave the warm, mild weather of 
home for all this cold, and never
to return, if not something worth 
hoping for, freezing for, even being 
evicted
for? I felt sad. An old woman passed, 
bent down with two shopping bags, her
eyes upon the slushy walk, and I 
thought of the old couple at the 
eviction.
How had it ended and where were they 
now? What an awful emotion. What
had he called it -- a death on the city 
pavements? How often did such things
occur? And what would he say of Mary? 
She was far from dead, or of being
ground to bits by New York. Hell, she 
knew very well how to live here, much
better than I with my college training 
-- training! Bledsoing, that was the
term. And I was the one being ground 
up, not Mary. Thinking of her made
me feel better. I couldn't imagine Mary 
being as helpless as the old woman
at the eviction, and by the time I 
reached the apartment I had begun to 
lose
my depression.

Chapter 14
The odor of Mary's cabbage changed my 
mind. Standing engulfed in
the fumes filling the hall, it struck 
me that I couldn't realistically reject 
the
job. Cabbage was always a depressing 
reminder of the leaner years of my
childhood and I suffered silently 
whenever she served it, but this was the
third time within the week and it 
dawned on me that Mary must be short of
money.
And here I've been congratulating 
myself for refusing a job, I
thought, when I don't even know how 
much money I owe her. I felt a quick
sickness grow within me. How could I 
face her? I went quietly to my room
and lay upon the bed, brooding. There 
were other roomers, who had jobs,
and I knew she received help from 
relatives; still there was no mistake, 
Mary
loved a variety of food and this 
concentration upon cabbage was no 
accident.

Why hadn't I noticed? She'd been too 
kind, never dunning me, and I lay
there hearing her, "Don't come 
bothering me with your little troubles, 
boy.
You'll git something bye and bye" -- 
when I would try to apologize for not
paying my rent and board. Perhaps 
another roomer had moved, or lost his
job. What were Mary's problems anyway; 
who "articulated her grievances," as
the redheaded man had put it? She had 
kept me going for months, yet I had
no idea. What kind of man was I 
becoming? I had taken her so much for
granted that I hadn't even thought of 
my debt when I refused the job. Nor
had I considered the embarrassment I 
might have caused her should the
police come to her home to arrest me 
for making that wild speech. Suddenly
I felt an urge to go look at her, 
perhaps I had really never seen her. I 
had
been acting like a child, not a man.
Taking out the crumpled paper, I looked 
at the telephone number.
He had mentioned an organization. What 
was it called? I hadn't inquired.
What a fool! At least I should have 
learned what I was turning down,
although I distrusted the red-headed 
man. Had I refused out of fear as well
as from resentment? Why didn't he just 
tell me what it was all about instead
of trying to impress me with his 
knowledge?
Then from down the hall I could hear 
Mary singing, her voice clear
and untroubled, though she sang a 
troubled song. It was the "Back Water
Blues." I lay listening as the sound 
flowed to and around me, bringing me a
calm sense of my indebtedness. When it 
faded I got up and put on my coat.
Perhaps it was not too late. I would 
find a telephone and call him; then he
could tell me exactly what he wanted 
and I could make a sensible decision.
Mary heard me this time. "Boy, when you 
come home?" she said,
sticking her head out of the kitchen. 
"I didn't even hear you."
"I came in a short while ago," I said. 
"You were busy so I didn't
bother you."
"Then where you going so soon, ain't 
you going to eat supper?"
"Yes, Mary," I said, "but I've got to 
go out now. I forgot to take care
of some business."
"Shucks! What kind of business you got 
on a cold night like this?"
she said.
"Oh, I don't know, I might have a 
surprise for you."
"Won't nothing surprise me," she said. 
"And you hurry on back here

and git something hot in your stomach."
Going through the cold seeking a 
telephone booth I realized that I
had committed myself to bring her some 
kind of surprise, and as I walked I
became mildly enthusiastic. It was, 
after all, a job that promised to 
exercise
my talent for public speaking, and if 
the pay was anything at all it would be
more than I had now. At least I could 
pay Mary something of what I owed
her. And she might receive some 
satisfaction that her prediction had 
proved
correct.
I seemed to be haunted by cabbage 
fumes; the little luncheonette in
which I found the telephone was reeking.
Brother Jack didn't sound at all 
surprised upon receiving my call.
"I'd like some information about --"
"Get here as quickly as you can, we're 
leaving shortly," he said,
giving me a Lenox Avenue address and 
hanging up before I could finish my
request.
I went out into the cold, annoyed both 
by his lack of surprise and
by the short, clipped manner in which 
he'd spoken, but I started out, taking
my own time. It wasn't far, and just as 
I reached the corner of Lenox a car
pulled up and I saw several men inside, 
Jack among them, smiling.
"Get in," he said. "We can talk where 
we're going. It's a party; you
might like it."
"But I'm not dressed," I said. "I'll 
call you tomorrow --"
"Dressed?" he chuckled. "You're all 
right, get in."
I got in beside him and the driver, 
noticing that there were three
men in the back. Then the car moved off.
No one spoke. Brother Jack seemed to 
sink immediately into deep
thought. The others looked out into the 
night. It was as though we were
mere chance passengers in a subway car. 
I felt uneasy, wondering where we
were going, but decided to say nothing. 
The car shot swiftly over the slush.
Looking out at the passing night I 
wondered what kind of men they
were. Certainly they didn't act as 
though they were heading for a very
sociable evening. I was hungry and I 
wouldn't get back in time for supper.
Well, maybe it would be worth it, both 
to Mary and to me. At least I
wouldn't have to eat that cabbage!
For a moment the car paused for the 
traffic light, then we were

circling swiftly through long stretches 
of snow-covered landscape lighted here
and there by street lamps and the 
nervously stabbing beams of passing 
cars:
We were flashing through Central Park, 
now completely transformed by the
snow. It was as though we had plunged 
suddenly into mid-country peace, yet
I knew that here, somewhere close by in 
the night, there was a zoo with its
dangerous animals. The lions and tigers 
in heated cages, the bears asleep, the
snakes coiled tightly underground. And 
there was also the reservoir of dark
water, all covered by snow and by 
night, by snow-fall and by night-fall,
buried beneath black and white, gray 
mist and gray silence. Then past the
driver's head I could see a wall of 
buildings looming beyond the windshield.
The car nosed slowly into traffic, 
dropped swiftly down a hill.
We stopped before an expensive-looking 
building in a strange part of
the city. I could see the word 
Chthonian on the storm awning stretched 
above
the walk as I got out with the others 
and went swiftly toward a lobby lighted
by dim bulbs set behind frosted glass, 
going past the uniformed doorman
with an uncanny sense of familiarity; 
feeling now, as we entered a soundproof
elevator and shot away at a mile a 
minute, that I had been through it all
before. Then we were stopping with a 
gentle bounce and I was uncertain
whether we had gone up or down. Brother 
Jack guided me down the hall to
a door on which I saw a bronze 
door-knocker in the shape of a 
large-eyed
owl. Now he hesitated a moment, his 
head thrust forward as though listening,
then his hand covered the owl from 
view, producing instead of the knock
which I expected, an icy peal of clear 
chimes. Shortly the door swung partly
open, revealing a smartly dressed 
woman, whose hard, handsome face broke
into smiles.
"Come in, Brothers," she said, her 
exotic perfume filling the foyer.
I noticed a clip of blazing diamonds on 
her dress as I tried to stand
aside for the others, but Brother Jack 
pushed me ahead.
"Excuse me," I said, but she held her 
ground, and I was pressing
tensely against her perfumed softness, 
seeing her smile as though there were
only she and I. Then I was past, 
disturbed not so much by the close 
contact,
as by the sense that I had somehow been 
through it all before. I couldn't
decide if it were from watching some 
similar scene in the movies, from books
I'd read, or from some recurrent but 
deeply buried dream. Whatsoever, it was
like entering a scene which, because of 
some devious circumstance, I had

hitherto watched only from a distance. 
How could they have such an
expensive place, I wondered.
"Put your things in the study," the 
woman said. "I'll go see about
drinks."
We entered a room lined with books and 
decorated with old musical
instruments: An Irish harp, a hunter's 
horn, a clarinet and a wooden flute
were suspended by the neck from the 
wall on pink and blue ribbons. There
were a leather divan and a number of 
easy chairs.
"Throw your coat on the divan," Brother 
Jack said.
I slid out of my overcoat and looked 
around. The dial of the radio
built into a section of the natural 
mahogany bookshelf was lighted, but I
couldn't hear any sound; and there was 
an ample desk on which rested silver
and crystal writing things, and, as one 
of the men came to stand gazing at
the bookcase, I was struck by the 
contrast between the richness of the 
room
and their rather poor clothing.
"Now we'll go into the other room," 
Brother Jack said, taking me by
the arm.
We entered a large room in which one 
entire wall was hung with
Italian-red draperies that fell in rich 
folds from the ceiling. A number of
well-dressed men and women were 
gathered in groups, some beside a grand
piano, the others lounging in the pale 
beige upholstery of the blond wood
chairs. Here and there I saw several 
attractive young women but carefully
avoided giving them more than a glance. 
I felt extremely uncomfortable,
although after brief glances no one 
paid me any special attention. It was as
though they hadn't seen me, as though I 
were here, and yet not here. The
others were moving away to join the 
various groups now, and Brother Jack
took my arm.
"Come, let's get a drink," he said, 
guiding me toward the end of the
room.
The woman who'd let us in was mixing 
drinks behind a handsome
free-form bar which was large enough to 
have graced a night club.
"How about a drink for us, Emma?" 
Brother Jack said.
"Well, now, I'll have to think about 
it," she said, tilting her severely
drawn head and smiling.
"Don't think, act," he said. "We're 
very thirsty men. This young man

pushed history ahead twenty years 
today."
"Oh," she said, her eyes becoming 
intent. "You must tell me about
him."
"Just read the morning papers, Emma. 
Things have begun to move.
Yes, leap ahead." He laughed deeply.
"What would you like, Brother?" she 
said, her eyes brushing slowly
over my face.
"Bourbon," I said, a little too loudly, 
as I remembered the best the
South had to offer. My face was warm, 
but I returned her glance as steadily
as I dared. It was not the harsh 
uninterested-in-you-as-a-human-being 
stare
that I'd known in the South, the kind 
that swept over a black man as though
he

were

a

horse

or

an

insect;

it

was

something

more,

a

direct,

what-type-of-mere-man-have-we-here kind 
of look that seemed to go beneath
my skin . . . Somewhere in my leg a 
muscle twitched violently.
"Emma, the bourbon! Two bourbons," 
Brother Jack said.
"You know," she said, picking up a 
decanter, "I'm intrigued."
"Naturally. Always," he said. 
"Intrigued and intriguing. But we're
dying of thirst."
"Only of impatience," she said, pouring 
the drinks. "I mean you are.
Tell me, where did you find this young 
hero of the people?"
"I didn't," Brother Jack said. "He 
simply arose out of a crowd. The
people always throw up their leaders, 
you know . . ."
"Throw them up," she said. "Nonsense, 
they chew them up and spit
them out. Their leaders are made, not 
born. Then they're destroyed. You've
always said that. Here you are, 
Brother."
He looked at her steadily. I took the 
heavy crystal glass and raised it
to my lips, glad for an excuse to turn 
from her eyes. A haze of cigarette
smoke drifted through the room. I heard 
a series of rich arpeggios sound on
the piano behind me and turned to look, 
hearing the woman Emma say not
quite softly enough, "But don't you 
think he should be a little blacker?"
"Shhh, don't be a damn fool," Brother 
Jack said sharply. "We're not
interested in his looks but in his 
voice. And I suggest, Emma, that you 
make
it your interest too . . ."
Suddenly hot and breathless, I saw a 
window across the room and
went over and stood looking out. We 
were up very high; street lamps and

traffic cut patterns in the night 
below. So she doesn't think I'm black 
enough.
What does she want, a black-face 
comedian? Who is she, anyway, Brother
Jack's wife, his girl friend? Maybe she 
wants to see me sweat coal tar, ink,
shoe polish, graphite. What was I, a 
man or a natural resource?
The window was so high that I could 
barely hear the sound of traffic
below . . . This was a bad beginning, 
but hell, I was being hired by Brother
Jack, if he still wanted me, not this 
Emma woman. I'd like to show her how
really black I am, I thought, taking a 
big drink of the bourbon. It was
smooth, cold. I'd have to be careful 
with the stuff. Anything might happen if
I had too much. With these people I'll 
have to be careful. Always careful.
With all people I'll have to be careful 
. . .
"It's a pleasant view, isn't it?" a 
voice said, and I whirled to see a
tall dark man. "But now would you mind 
joining us in the library?" he said.
Brother Jack, the men who had come 
along in the car, and two
others whom I hadn't seen before were 
waiting.
"Come in, Brother," Jack said. 
"Business before pleasure is always a
good rule, whoever you are. Some day 
the rule shall be business with
pleasure, for the joy of labor shall 
have been restored. Sit down."
I took the chair directly before him, 
wondering what this speech was
all about.
"You know, Brother," he said, "we don't 
ordinarily interrupt our social
gatherings with business, but with you 
it's necessary."
"I'm very sorry," I said. "I should 
have called you earlier."
"Sorry? Why, we're only too glad to do 
so. We've been waiting for
you for months. Or for someone who 
could do what you've done."
"But what . . . ?" I said.
"What are we doing? What is our 
mission? It's simple; we are
working for a better world for all 
people. It's that simple. Too many have
been dispossessed

of

their heritage, and

we have banded

together in

brotherhood so as to do something about 
it. What do you think of that?"
"Why, I think it's fine," I said, 
trying to take in the full meaning of
his words. "I think it's excellent. But 
how?"
"By moving them to action just as you 
did this morning. . . Brothers,
I was there," he said to the others, 
"and he was magnificent. With a few
words he set off an effective 
demonstration against evictions!"

"I was present too," another said. "It 
was amazing."
"Tell us something of your background," 
Brother Jack said, his voice
and manner demanding truthful answers. 
And I explained briefly that I had
come up looking for work to pay my way 
through college and had failed.
"Do you still plan to return?"
"Not now," I said. "I'm all done with 
that."
"It's just as well," Brother Jack said. 
"You have little to learn down
there. However, college training is not 
a bad thing -- although you'll have to
forget most of it. Did you study 
economics?"
"Some."
"Sociology?"
"Yes."
"Well, let me advise you to forget it. 
You'll be given books to read
along with some material that explains 
our program in detail. But we're
moving

too

fast.

Perhaps

you

aren't

interested

in

working

for

the

Brotherhood."
"But you haven't told me what I'm 
supposed to do," I said.
He looked at me fixedly, picking up his 
glass slowly and taking a
long swallow.
"Let's put it this way," he said. "How 
would you like to be the new
Booker T. Washington?"
"What!" I looked into his bland eyes 
for laughter, seeing his red head
turned slightly to the side. "Please, 
now," I said.
"Oh, yes, I'm serious."
"Then I don't understand you." Was I 
drunk? I looked at him; he
seemed sober.
"What do you think of the idea? Or 
better still, what do you think of
Booker T. Washington?"
"Why, naturally, I think he was an 
important figure. At least most
people say so."
"But?"
"Well," I was at a loss for words. He 
was going too fast again. The
whole idea was insane and yet the 
others were looking at me calmly; one of
them was lighting up an underslung 
pipe. The match sputtered, caught fire.
"What is it?" Brother Jack insisted.

"Well, I guess I don't think he was as 
great as the Founder."
"Oh? And why not?"
"Well, in the first place, the Founder 
came before him and did
practically everything Booker T. 
Washington did and a lot more. And more
people believed in him. You hear a lot 
of arguments about Booker T.
Washington, but few would argue about 
the Founder . . ."
"No, but perhaps that is because the 
Founder lies outside history,
while Washington is still a living 
force. However, the new Washington shall
work for the poor . . ."
I looked into my crystal glass of 
bourbon. It was unbelievable, yet
strangely exciting and I had the sense 
of being present at the creation of
important events, as though a curtain 
had been parted and I was being
allowed to glimpse how the country 
operated. And yet none of these men was
well known, or at least I'd never seen 
their faces in the newspapers.
"During these times of indecision when 
all the old answers are
proven false, the people look back to 
the dead to give them a clue," he went
on. "They call first upon one and then 
upon another of those who have acted
in the past."
"If you please, Brother," the man with 
the pipe interrupted, "I think
you should speak more concretely."
"Please don't interrupt," Brother Jack 
said icily.
"I wish only to point out that a 
scientific terminology exists," the
man said, emphasizing his words with 
his pipe. "After all, we call ourselves
scientists here. Let us speak as 
scientists."
"In due time," Brother Jack said. "In 
due time . . . You see,
Brother," he said, turning to me, "the 
trouble is that there is little the dead
can do; otherwise they wouldn't be the 
dead. No! But on the other hand, it
would be a great mistake to assume that 
the dead are absolutely powerless.
They are powerless only to give the 
full answer to the new questions posed
for the living by history. But they 
try! Whenever they hear the imperious
cries of the people in a crisis, the 
dead respond. Right now in this country,
with its many national groups, all the 
old heroes are being called back to life
-- Jefferson, Jackson, Pulaski, 
Garibaldi, Booker T. Washington, Sun 
Yat-sen,
Danny O'Connell, Abraham Lincoln and 
countless others are being asked to
step once again upon the stage of 
history. I can't say too emphatically 
that

we stand at a terminal point in 
history, at a moment of supreme world 
crisis.
Destruction lies ahead unless things 
are changed. And things must be
changed. And changed by the people. 
Because, Brother, the enemies of man
are dispossessing the world! Do you 
understand?"
"I'm beginning to," I said, greatly 
impressed.
"There are other terms, other more 
accurate ways of saying all this,
but we haven't time for that right now. 
We speak now in terms that are easy
to understand. As you spoke to the 
crowd this morning."
"I see," I said, feeling uncomfortable 
under his stare.
"So it isn't a matter of whether you 
wish to be the new Booker T.
Washington, my friend. Booker 
Washington was resurrected today at a 
certain
eviction in Harlem. He came out from 
the anonymity of the crowd and spoke
to the people. So you see, I don't joke 
with you. Or play with words either.
There is a scientific explanation for 
this phenomenon -- as our learned
brother has graciously reminded me -- 
you'll learn it in time, but whatever
you call it the reality of the world 
crisis is a fact. We are all realists 
here,
and materialists. It is a question of 
who shall determine the direction of
events. That is why we've brought you 
into this room. This morning you
answered the people's appeal and we 
want you to be the true interpreter of
the people. You shall be the new Booker 
T. Washington, but even greater
than he."
There was silence. I could hear the wet 
cracking of the pipe.
"Perhaps we should allow the Brother to 
express himself as to how
he feels about all this," the man with 
the pipe said.
"Well, Brother?" Brother Jack said.
I looked into their waiting faces.
"It's all so new to me that I don't 
know exactly what I do think," I
said. "Do you really think you have the 
right man?"
"You mustn't let that worry you," 
Brother Jack said. "You will rise to
the task; it is only necessary that you 
work hard and follow instructions."
They stood up now. I looked at them, 
fighting a sense of unreality.
They stared at me as the fellows had 
done when I was being initiated into
my college fraternity. Only this was 
real and now was the time for me to
decide or to say I thought they were 
crazy and go back to Mary's. But what
is there to lose? I thought. At least 
they've invited me, one of us, in at the

beginning of something big; and 
besides, if I refused to join them, 
where
would I goto a job as porter at the 
railroad station? At least here was a
chance to speak.
"When shall I start?" I said.
"Tomorrow, we must waste no time. By 
the way, where are you
living?"
"I rent a room from a woman in Harlem," 
I said.
"A housewife?"
"She's a widow," I said. "She rents 
rooms."
"What is her educational background?"
"She's had very little."
"More or less like the old couple that 
was evicted?"
"Somewhat, but better able to take care 
of herself. She's tough," I
said with a laugh.
"Does she ask a lot of questions? Are 
you friendly with her?"
"She's been very nice to me," I said. 
"She allowed me to stay on
after I was unable to pay my rent."
He shook his head. "No."
"What is it?" I said.
"It is best that you move," he said. 
"We'll find you a place further
downtown so that you'll be within easy 
call . . ."
"But I have no money, and she's 
entirely trustworthy."
"That will be taken care of," he said, 
waving his hand. "You must
realize immediately that much of our 
work is opposed. Our discipline
demands therefore that we talk to no 
one and that we avoid situations in
which information might be given away 
unwittingly. So you must put aside
your past. Do you have a family?"
"Yes."
"Are you in touch with them?"
"Of course. I write home now and then," 
I said, beginning to resent
his method of questioning. His voice 
had become cold, searching.
"Then it's best that you cease for a 
while," he said. "Anyway, you'll
be too busy. Here." He fished into his 
vest pocket for something and got
suddenly to his feet.
"What is it?" someone asked.

"Nothing, excuse me," he said, rolling 
to the door and beckoning. In
a moment I saw the woman appear.
"Emma, the slip of paper I gave you. 
Give it to the new Brother," he
said as she stepped inside and closed 
the door.
"Oh, so it's you," she said with a 
meaningful smile.
I watched her reach into the bosom of 
her taffeta hostess gown and
remove a white envelope.
"This is your new identity," Brother 
Jack said. "Open it."
Inside I found a name written on a slip 
of paper.
"That is your new name," Brother Jack 
said. "Start thinking of
yourself by that name from this moment. 
Get it down so that even if you are
called in the middle of the night you 
will respond. Very soon you shall be
known by it all over the country. You 
are to answer to no

other,

understand?"
"I'll try," I said.
"Don't forget his living quarters," the 
tall man said.
"No," Brother Jack said with a frown. 
"Emma, please, some funds."
"How much, Jack?" she said.
He turned to me. "Do you owe much rent?"
"Too much," I said.
"Make it three hundred, Emma," he said.
"Never mind," he said as I showed my 
surprise at the sum. "This
will pay your debts and buy you 
clothing. Call me in the morning and 
I'll
have selected your living quarters. For 
a start your salary will be sixty 
dollars
a week."
Sixty a week! There was nothing I could 
say. The woman had
crossed the room to the desk and 
returned with the money, placing it in 
my
hand.
"You'd better put it away," she said 
expansively.
"Well, Brothers, I believe that's all," 
he said. "Emma, how about a
drink?"
"Of course, of course," she said, going 
to a cabinet and removing a
decanter and a set of glasses in which 
she poured about an inch of clear
liquid.
"Here you are, Brothers," she said.

Taking his, Brother Jack raised it to 
his nose, inhaling deeply. "To
the Brotherhood of Man . . . to History 
and to Change," he said, touching
my glass.
"To History," we all said.
The stuff burned, causing me to lower 
my head to hide the tears that
popped from my eyes.
"Aaaah!" someone said with deep 
satisfaction.
"Come along," Emma said. "Let's join 
the others."
"Now for some pleasure," Brother Jack 
said. "And remember your
new identity."
I wanted to think but they gave me no 
time. I was swept into the
large room and introduced by my new 
name. Everyone smiled and seemed
eager to meet me, as though they all 
knew the role I was to play. All
grasped me warmly by the hand.
"What is your opinion of the state of 
women's rights, Brother?" I was
asked by a plain woman in a large black 
velvet tarn. But before I could open
my mouth, Brother Jack had pushed me 
along to a group of men, one of
whom seemed to know all about the 
eviction. Nearby, a group around the
piano were singing folk songs with more 
volume than melody. We moved
from group to group, Brother Jack very 
authoritative, the others always
respectful. He must be a powerful man, 
I thought, not a clown at all. But to
hell with this Booker T. Washington 
business. I would do the work but I
would be no one except myself -- 
whoever I was, I would pattern my life 
on
that of the Founder. They might think I 
was acting like Booker T.
Washington; let them. But what I 
thought of myself I would keep to 
myself.
Yes, and I'd have to hide the fact that 
I had actually been afraid when I
made my speech. Suddenly I felt 
laughter bubbling inside me. I'd have to
catch up with this science of history 
business.
We had come to stand near the piano 
now, where an intense young
man questioned me about various leaders 
of the Harlem community. I knew
them only by name, but pretended that I 
knew them all.
"Good," he said, "good, we have to work 
with all these forces during
the coming period."
"Yes, you're quite right," I said, 
giving my glass a tinkling twirl. A
short broad man saw me and waved the 
others to a halt. "Say, Brother," he

called. "Hold the music, boys, hold it!"
"Yes, uh . . . Brother," I said.
"You're just who we need. We been 
looking for you."
"Oh," I said.
"How about a spiritual, Brother? Or one 
of those real good ole Negro
work songs? Like this: Ah went to 
Atlanta -- nevah been there befo'," he
sang, his arms held out from his body 
like a penguin's wings, glass in one
hand, cigar in the other. "White man 
sleep in a feather bed, Nigguh sleep on
the flo' . . . Ha! Ha! How about it, 
Brother?"
"The Brother does not sing!" Brother 
Jack roared staccato.
"Nonsense, all colored people sing."
"This is an outrageous example of 
unconscious racial chauvinism!"
Jack said.
"Nonsense, I like their singing," the 
broad man said doggedly.
"The Brother does not sing!" Brother 
Jack cried, his face turning a
deep purple.
The broad man regarded him stubbornly. 
"Why don't you let him say
whether he can sing or not . . . ? Come 
on, Brother, git hot! Go Down,
Moses," he bellowed in a ragged 
baritone, putting down his cigar and
snapping his fingers. "Way down in 
Egypt's land. Tell dat ole Pharaoh to 
let
ma colored folks sing! I'm for the 
rights of the colored brother to sing!" 
he
shouted belligerently.
Brother Jack looked as if he would 
choke; he raised his hand,
signaling. I saw two men shoot from 
across the room and lead the short man
roughly away. Brother Jack followed 
them as they disappeared beyond the
door, leaving an enormous silence.
For a moment I stood there, my eyes 
riveted upon the door, then I
turned, the glass hot in my hand, my 
face feeling as though it would explode.
Why was everyone staring at me as 
though I were responsible? Why the hell
were they staring at me? Suddenly I 
yelled, "What's the matter with you?
Haven't you ever seen a drunk --" when 
somewhere off the foyer the broad
man's voice staggered drunkenly to us, 
"St. Louis mammieeeee -- with her
diamond riiiings . . ." and was clipped 
off by a slamming door, leaving a
roomful of bewildered faces. And 
suddenly I was laughing hysterically.
"He hit me in the face," I wheezed. "He 
hit me in the face with a

yard of chitterlings!" -- bending 
double, roaring, the whole room seeming 
to
dance up and down with each rapid 
eruption of laughter.
"He threw a hog maw," I cried, but no 
one seemed to understand.
My eyes filled, I could barely see. 
"He's high as a Georgia pine," I 
laughed,
turning to the group nearest me. "He's 
abso-lutely drunk . . . off music!"
"Yes. Sure," a man said nervously. "Ha, 
ha . . ."
"Three sheets in the wind," I laughed, 
getting my breath now, and
discovering that the silent tension of 
the others was ebbing into a ripple of
laughter that sounded throughout the 
room, growing swiftly to a roar, a laugh
of all dimensions, intensities and 
intonations. Everyone was joining in. 
The
room fairly bounced.
"And did you see Brother Jack's face," 
a man shouted, shaking his
head.
"It was murder!"
"Go down Moses!"
"I tell you it was murder!"
Across the room they were pounding 
someone on the back to keep
him from choking. Handkerchiefs 
appeared, there was much honking of 
noses,
wiping of eyes. A glass crashed to the 
floor, a chair was overturned. I fought
against the painful laughter, and as I 
calmed I saw them looking at me with
a sort of embarrassed gratitude. It was 
sobering and yet they seemed bent
upon pretending that nothing unusual 
had happened. They smiled. Several
seemed about to come over and pound my 
back, shake my hand. It was as
though I had told them something which 
they'd wished very much to hear,
had rendered them an important service 
which I couldn't understand. But
there it was, working in their faces. 
My stomach ached. I wanted to leave, to
get their eyes off me. Then a thin 
little woman came over and grasped my
hand.
"I'm so sorry that this had to happen," 
she said in a slow Yankee
voice, "really and truly sorry. Some of 
our Brothers aren't so highly
developed, you know. Although they mean 
very well. You must allow me to
apologize for him . . ."
"Oh, he was only tipsy," I said, 
looking into her thin, New England
face.
"Yes, I know, and revealingly so. I 
would never ask our colored

brothers to sing, even though I love to 
hear them. Because I know that it
would be a very backward thing. You are 
here to fight along with us, not to
entertain. I think you understand me, 
don't you, Brother?"
I gave her a silent smile.
"Of course you do. I must go now, 
good-bye," she said, extending her
little white-gloved hand and leaving.
I was puzzled. Just what did she mean? 
Was it that she understood
that we resented having others think 
that we were all entertainers and 
natural
singers? But now after the mutual 
laughter something disturbed me: 
Shouldn't
there be some way for us to be asked to 
sing? Shouldn't the short man have
the right to make a mistake without his 
motives being considered consciously
or unconsciously malicious? After all, 
he was singing, or trying to. What if I
asked him to sing? I watched the little 
woman, dressed in black like a
missionary, winding her way through the 
crowd. What on earth was she doing
here? What part did she play? Well, 
whatever she meant, she's nice and I
like her.
Just then Emma came up and challenged 
me to dance and I led her
toward the floor as the piano played, 
thinking of the vet's prediction and
drawing her to me as though I danced 
with such as her every evening. For
having committed myself, I felt that I 
could never allow myself to show
surprise or upset -- even when 
confronted with situations furthest 
from my
experience. Otherwise I might be 
considered undependable, or unworthy. I 
felt
that somehow they expected me to 
perform even those tasks for which
nothing in my experience -- except 
perhaps my imagination -- had prepared
me. Still it was nothing new, white 
folks seemed always to expect you to
know those things which they'd done 
everything they could think of to
prevent you from knowing. The thing to 
do was to be prepared -- as my
grandfather had been when it was 
demanded that he quote the entire United
States Constitution as a test of his 
fitness to vote. He had confounded them
all by passing the test, although they 
still refused him the ballot . . . 
Anyway,
these were different.
It was close to five A.M., many dances 
and many bourbons later,
when I reached Mary's. Somehow, I felt 
surprised that the room was still the
same -- except that Mary had changed 
the bed linen. Good old Mary. I felt
sadly sobered. And as I undressed I saw 
my outworn clothes and realized

that I'd have to shed them. Certainly 
it was time. Even my hat would go; its
green was sun-faded and brown, like a 
leaf struck by the winter's snows. I
would require a new one for my new 
name. A black broad-brimmed one;
perhaps a homburg . . . humbug? I 
laughed. Well, I could leave packing for
tomorrow -- I had very little, which 
was perhaps all to the good. I would
travel light, far and fast. They were 
fast people, all right. What a vast
difference between Mary and those for 
whom I was leaving her. And why
should it be this way, that the very 
job which might make it possible for me
to do some of the things which she 
expected of me required that I leave 
her?
What kind of room would Brother Jack 
select for me and why wasn't I left
to select my own? It didn't seem right 
that in order to become a Harlem
Leader I should live elsewhere. Yet 
nothing seemed right and I would have to
rely upon their judgment. They seemed 
expert in such matters.
But how far could I trust them, and in 
what way were they different
from the trustees? Whatever, I was 
committed; I'd learn in the process of
working with them, I thought, 
remembering the money. The bills were 
crisp
and fresh and I tried to imagine Mary's 
surprise when I paid her all my back
rent and board. She'd think that I was 
kidding. But money could never repay
her generosity. She would never 
understand my wanting to move so quickly
after getting a job. And if I had any 
kind of success at all, it would seem 
the
height of ingratitude. How would I face 
her? She had asked for nothing in
return. Or hardly anything, except that 
I make something of myself that she
called a "race leader." I shivered in 
the cold. Telling her that I was moving
would be a hard proposition. I didn't 
like to think of it, but one couldn't be
sentimental. As Brother Jack had said, 
History makes harsh demands of us
all. But they were demands that had to 
be met if men were to be the
masters and not the victims of their 
times. Did I believe that? Perhaps I had
already begun to pay. Besides, I might 
as well admit right now, I thought,
that there are many things about people 
like Mary that I dislike. For one
thing, they seldom know where their 
personalities end and yours begins; they
usually think in terms of "we" while I 
have always tended to think in terms
of "me" -- and that has caused some 
friction, even with my own family.
Brother Jack and the others talked in 
terms of "we," but it was a different,
bigger "we."
Well, I had a new name and new 
problems. I had best leave the old

behind. Perhaps it would be best not to 
see Mary at all, just place the money
in an envelope and leave it on the 
kitchen table where she'd be sure to 
find
it. It would be better that way, I 
thought drowsily; then there'd be no 
need
to stand before her and stumble over 
emotions and words that were at best
all snarled up and undifferentiated . . 
. One thing about the people at the
Chthonian, they all seemed able to say 
just what they felt and meant in hard,
clear terms. That too, I'd have to 
learn . . . I stretched out beneath the
covers, hearing the springs groan 
beneath me. The room was cold. I 
listened
to the night sounds of the house. The 
clock ticked with empty urgency, as
though trying to catch up with the 
time. In the street a siren howled.

Chapter 15
Then I was awake and not awake, sitting 
bolt upright in bed and
trying to peer through the sick gray 
light as I sought the meaning of the
brash, nerve-jangling sound. Pushing 
the blanket aside I clasped my hands to
my ears. Someone was pounding the steam 
line, and I stared helplessly for
what seemed minutes. My ears throbbed. 
My side began itching violently and
I tore open my pajamas to scratch, and 
suddenly the pain seemed to leap
from my ears to my side and I saw gray 
marks appearing where the old skin
was flaking away beneath my digging 
nails. And as I watched I saw thin lines
of blood well up in the scratches, 
bringing pain and joining time and place
again, and I thought, The room has lost 
its heat on my last day at Mary's,
and suddenly I was sick at heart.
The clock, its alarm lost in the larger 
sound, said seven-thirty, and I
got out of bed. I'd have to hurry. 
There was shopping to do before I called
Brother Jack for my instructions and I 
had to get the money to Mary -- Why
didn't they stop that noise? I reached 
for my shoes, flinching as the knocking
seemed to sound an inch above my head. 
Why don't they stop, I thought.
And why do I feel so let down? The 
bourbon? My nerves going bad?
Suddenly I was across the room in a 
bound, pounding the pipe

furiously with my shoe heel.
"Stop it, you ignorant fool!"
My head was splitting. Beside myself, I 
struck pieces of silver from
the pipe, exposing the black and rusted 
iron. He was using a piece of metal
now, his blows ringing with a ragged 
edge.
If only I knew who it was, I thought, 
looking for something heavy
with which to strike back. If only I 
knew!
Then near the door I saw something 
which I'd never noticed there
before: the cast-iron figure of a very 
black, red-lipped and wide-mouthed
Negro, whose white eyes stared up at me 
from the floor, his face an
enormous grin, his single large black 
hand held palm up before his chest. It
was a bank, a piece of early Americana, 
the kind of bank which, if a coin is
placed in the hand and a lever pressed 
upon the back, will raise its arm and
flip the coin into the grinning mouth. 
For a second I stopped, feeling hate
charging within me, then dashed over 
and grabbed it, suddenly as enraged by
the tolerance or lack of 
discrimination, or whatever, that 
allowed Mary to
keep such a self-mocking image around, 
as by the knocking.
In my hand its expression seemed more 
of a strangulation than a
grin. It was choking, filled to the 
throat with coins.
How the hell did it get here, I 
wondered, dashing over and striking
the pipe a blow with the kinky iron 
head. "Shut up!" I screamed, which
seemed only to enrage the hidden 
knocker. The din was deafening. Tenants
up and down the entire line of 
apartments joined in. I hammered back 
with
the iron naps, seeing the silver fly, 
striking like driven sand against my 
face.
The pipe fairly hummed with the blows. 
Windows were going up. Voices
yelled obscenities down the airshaft.
Who started all this, I wondered, who's 
responsible?
"Why don't you act like responsible 
people living in the twentieth
century?" I yelled, aiming a blow at 
the pipe. "Get rid of your cottonpatch
ways! Act civilized!"
Then came a crash of sound and I felt 
the iron head crumble and fly
apart in my hand. Coins flew over the 
room like crickets, ringing, rattling
against the floor, rolling. I stopped 
dead.
"Just listen to 'em! Just listen to 
'em!" Mary called from the hall.
"Enough noise to wake the dead! They 
know when the heat don't come up

that the super's drunk or done walked 
off the job looking for his woman, or
something. Why don't folks act 
according to what they know?"
She was at my door now, knocking stroke 
for stroke with the blows
landing on the pipe, calling, "Son! 
Ain't some of that knocking coming from
in there?"
I turned from side to side in 
indecision, looking at the pieces of
broken head, the small coins of all 
denominations that were scattered about.
"You hear me, boy?" she called.
"What is it?" I called, dropping to the 
floor and reaching frantically
for the broken pieces, thinking, If she 
opens the door, I'm lost . . .
"I said is any of that racket coming 
from in there?"
"Yes, it is, Mary," I called, "but I'm 
all right . . . I'm already awake."
I saw the knob move and froze, hearing, 
"Sounded to me like a heap
of it was coming from in there. You got 
your clothes on?"
"No," I cried. "I'm just dressing. I'll 
have them on in a minute."
"Come on out to the kitchen," she said. 
"It's warm out there. And
there's some hot water on the stove to 
wash your face in . . . and some
coffee. Lawd, just listen at the 
racket!"
I stood as though frozen, until she 
moved away from the door. I'd
have to hurry. I kneeled, picking up a 
piece of the bank, a part of the
red-shirted chest, reading the legend, 
FEED ME in a curve of white iron
letters, like the team name on an 
athlete's shirt. The figure had gone to
pieces like a grenade, scattering 
jagged fragments of painted iron among 
the
coins. I looked at my hand; a small 
trickle of blood showed. I wiped it 
away,
thinking, I'll have to hide this mess! 
I can't take her this and the news that
I'm moving at the same time. Taking a 
newspaper from the chair I folded it
stiffly and swept the coins and broken 
metal into a pile. Where would I hide
it, I wondered, looking with profound 
distaste at the iron kinks, the dull red
of a piece of grinning lip. Why, I 
thought with anguish, would Mary have
something like this around anyway? Just 
why? I looked under the bed. It was
dustless there, no place to hide 
anything. She was too good a 
housekeeper.
Besides, what of the coins? Hell! Maybe 
the thing was left by the former
roomer. Anyway, whose ever it was, it 
had to be hidden. There was the
closet, but she'd find it there too. 
After I was gone a few days she'd clean
out my things and there it'd be. The 
knocking had gone beyond mere protest

over heatlessness now, they had fallen 
into a ragged rumba rhythm:
Knock!
Knock-knock
Knock-knock!
Knock!
Knock-knock!
Knock-knock!
vibrating the very floor.
"Just a few minutes more, you 
bastards," I said aloud, "and I'll be
gone! No respect for the individual. 
Why don't you think about those who
might wish to sleep? What if someone is 
near a nervous breakdown . . . ?"
But there was still the package. There 
was nothing to do but get rid
of it along the way downtown. Making a 
tight bundle, I placed it in my
overcoat pocket. I'd simply have to 
give Mary enough money to cover the
coins. I'd give her as much as I could 
spare, half of what I had, if necessary.
That should make up for some of it. She 
should appreciate that. And now I
realized with a feeling of dread that I 
had to meet her face to face. There
was no way out. Why can't I just tell 
her that I'm leaving and pay her and
go on off? She was a landlady, I was a 
tenant -- No, there was more to it
and I wasn't hard enough, scientific 
enough, even to tell her that I was
leaving. I'll tell her I have a job, 
anything, but it has to be now.
She was sitting at the table drinking 
coffee when I went in, the
kettle hissing away on the stove, 
sending up jets of steam.
"Gee, but you slow this morning," she 
said. "Take some of that water
in the kettle and go wash your face. 
Though sleepy as you look, maybe you
ought to just use cold water."
"This'll do," I said flatly, feeling 
the steam drifting upon my face,
growing swiftly damp and cold. The 
clock above the stove was slower than
mine.
In the bathroom I put in the plug and 
poured some of the hot water
and cooled it from the spigot. I kept 
the tear-warm water upon my face a
long time, then dried and returned to 
the kitchen.

"Run it full again," she said when I 
returned. "How you feel?"
"So-so," I said.
She sat with her elbows upon the 
enameled table top, her cup held
in both hands, one work-worn little 
finger delicately curved. I went to the
sink and turned the spigot, feeling the 
cold rush of water upon my hand,
thinking of what I had to do . . .
"That's enough there, boy," Mary said, 
startling me. "Wake up!"
"I guess I'm not all here," I said. "My 
mind was wandering."
"Well, call it back and come get you 
some coffee. Soon's I've had
mine, I'll see what kind of breakfast I 
can whip together. I guess after last
night you can eat this morning. You 
didn't come back for supper."
"I'm sorry," I said. "Coffee will be 
enough for me."
"Boy, you better start eating again," 
she warned, pouring me a full
cup of coffee.
I took the cup and sipped it, black. It 
was bitter. She glanced from
me to the sugar bowl and back again but 
remained silent, then swirled her
cup, looking into it.
"Guess I'll have to get some better 
filters," she mused. "These I got
lets through the grounds along with the 
coffee, the good with the bad. I don't
know though, even with the best of 
filters you apt to find a ground or two 
at
the bottom of your cup."
I blew upon the steaming liquid, 
avoiding Mary's eyes. The knocking
was becoming unbearable again. I'd have 
to get away. I looked at the hot
metallic surface of the coffee, 
noticing on oily, opalescent swirl.
"Look, Mary," I said, plunging in, "I 
want to talk to you about
something."
"Now see here, boy," she said gruffly, 
"I don't want you worrying me
about your rent this morning. I'm not 
worried 'cause when you get it I know
you'll pay me. Meanwhile you forget it. 
Nobody in this house is going to
starve. You having any luck lining up a 
job?"
"No -- I mean not exactly," I 
stammered, seizing the opportunity.
"But I've got an appointment to see 
about one this morning . . ."
Her face brightened. "Oh, that's fine. 
You'll get something yet. I know
it."
"But about my debt," I began again.

"Don't worry about it. How about some 
hotcakes?" she asked, rising
and going to look into the cabinet. 
"They'll stick with you in this cold
weather."
"I won't have time," I said. "But I've 
got something for you . . ."
"What's that?" she said, her voice 
coming muffled as she peered
inside the cabinet.
"Here," I said hurriedly reaching into 
my pocket for the money.
"What? -- Let's see if I got some syrup 
. . ."
"But look," I said eagerly, removing a 
hundred-dollar bill.
"Must be on a higher shelf," she said, 
her back still turned.
I sighed as she dragged a step ladder 
from beside the cabinet and
mounted it, holding onto the doors and 
peering upon an upper shelf. I'd
never get it said. . .
"But I'm trying to give you something," 
I said.
"Why don't you quit bothering me, boy? 
You trying to give me
what?" she said looking over her 
shoulder.
I held up the bill. "This," I said.
She craned her head around. "Boy, what 
you got there?"
"It's money."
"Money? Good God, boy!" she said, 
almost losing her balance as she
turned completely around. "Where'd you 
get all that much money? You been
playing the numbers?"
"That's it. My number came up," I said 
thankfully -- thinking, What'll
I say if she asks what the number was? 
I didn't know. I had never played.
"But how come you didn't tell me? I'd 
have at least put a nickel on
it."
"I didn't think it would do anything," 
I said.
"Well, I declare. And I bet it was your 
first time too."
"It was."
"See there, I knowed you was a lucky 
one. Here I been playing for
years and the first drop of the bucket 
you hits for that kinda money. I'm sho
glad for you, son. I really am. But I 
don't want your money. You wait 'til you
get a job."
"But I'm not giving you all of it," I 
said hastily. "This is just on
account."

"But that's a hundred-dollar bill. I 
take that an' try to change it and
the white folks'll want to know my 
whole life's history." She snorted. 
"They
want to know where I was born, where I 
work, and where I been for the last
six months, and when I tell 'em they 
still gonna think I stole it. Ain't you
got nothing smaller?"
"That's the smallest. Take it," I 
pleaded. "I'll have enough left."
She looked at me shrewdly. "You sho?"
"It's the truth," I said.
"Well, I de-clare -- Let me get down 
from up here before I fall and
break my neck! Son," she said, coming 
down off the ladder, "I sho do
appreciate it. But I tell you, I'm just 
going to keep part of it for myself and
the rest I'm going to save for you. You 
get hard up just come to Mary."
"I think I'll be all right now," I 
said, watching her fold the money
carefully, placing it in the leather 
bag that always hung on the back of her
chair.
"I'm really glad, 'cause now I can take 
care of that bill they been
bothering me about. It'll do me so much 
good to go in there and plop down
some money and tell them folks to quit 
bothering me. Son, I believe your
luck done changed. You dream that 
number?"
I glanced at her eager face. "Yes," I 
said, "but it was a mixed-up
dream."
"What was the figger -- Jesus! What's 
this!" she cried, getting up and
pointing at the linoleum near the steam 
line.
I saw a small drove of roaches trooping 
frantically down the steam
line from the floor above, plummeting 
to the floor as the vibration of the
pipe shook them off.
"Get the broom!" Mary yelled. "Out of 
the closet there!"
Stepping around the chair I snatched 
the broom and joined her,
splattering the scattering roaches with 
both broom and feet, hearing the pop
and snap as I brought the pressure down 
upon them vehemently.
"The filthy, stinking things," Mary 
cried. "Git that one under the
table! Yon' he goes, don't let him git 
away! The nasty rascal!"
I swung the broom, battering and 
sweeping the squashed insects into
piles. Breathing excitedly Mary got the 
dust pan and handed it to me.
"Some folks just live in filth," she 
said disgustedly. "Just let a little

knocking start and here it comes 
crawling out. All you have to do is 
shake
things up a bit."
I looked at the damp spots on the 
linoleum, then shakily replaced
the pan and broom and started out of 
the room.
"Aren't you going to eat no breakfast?" 
she said. "Soon's I wipe up
this mess I'm going to start."
"I don't have time," I said, my hand on 
the knob. "My appointment
is early and I have a few things to do 
beforehand."
"Then you better stop and have you 
something hot soon as you can.
Don't do to go around in this cold 
weather without something in your belly.
And don't think you goin' start eating 
out just 'cause you got some money!"
"I don't. I'll take care of it," I said 
to her back as she washed her
hands.
"Well, good luck, son," she called. 
"You really give me a pleasant
surprise this morning -- and if that's 
a lie, I hope something big'll bite me!"
She laughed gaily and I went down the 
hall to my room and closed
the door. Pulling on my overcoat I got 
down my prized brief case from the
closet. It was still as new as the 
night of the battle royal, and sagged 
now as
I placed the smashed bank and coins 
inside and locked the flap. Then I
closed the closet door and left.
The knocking didn't bother me so much 
now. Mary was singing
something sad and serene as I went down 
the hall, and still singing as I
opened the door and stepped into the 
outside hall. Then I remembered, and
there beneath the dim hall light I took 
the faintly perfumed paper from my
wallet and carefully unfolded it. A 
tremor passed over me; the hall was 
cold.
Then it was gone and I squinted and 
took a long, hard look at my new
Brotherhood name.
The night's snowfall was already being 
churned to muck by the
passing cars, and it was warmer. 
Joining the pedestrians along the walk, 
I
could feel the brief case swinging 
against my leg from the weight of the
package, and I determined to get rid of 
the coins and broken iron at the first
ash can. I needed nothing like this to 
remind me of my last morning at
Mary's.
I made for a row of crushed garbage 
cans lined before a row of old
private houses, coming alongside and 
tossing the package casually into one of

them and moving on -- only to hear a 
door open behind me and a voice ring
out,
"Oh, no you don't, oh, no you don't! 
Just come right back here and
get it!"
Turning, I saw a little woman standing 
on the stoop with a green
coat covering her head and shoulders, 
its sleeves hanging limp like extra
atrophied arms.
"I mean you," she called. "Come on back 
an' get your trash. An'
don't ever put your trash in my can 
again!"
She was a short yellow woman with a 
pince-nez on a chain, her hair
pinned up in knots.
"We keep our place clean and 
respectable and we don't want you
field niggers coming up here from the 
South and ruining things," she shouted
with blazing hate.
People were stopping to look. A super 
from a building down the
block came out and stood in the middle 
of the walk, pounding his fist against
his palm with a dry, smacking sound. I 
hesitated, embarrassed and annoyed.
Was this woman crazy?
"I mean it! Yes, you! I'm talking to 
you! Just take it right out!
Rosalie," she called to someone inside 
the house, "call the police, Rosalie!"
I can't afford that, I thought, and 
walked back to the can. "What
does it matter, Miss?" I called up to 
her. "When the collectors come, garbage
is garbage. I just didn't want to throw 
it into the street. I didn't know that
some kinds of garbage were better than 
others."
"Never mind your impertinence," she 
said. "I'm sick and tired of
having you southern Negroes mess up 
things for the rest of us!"
"All right," I said, "I'll get it out."
I reached into the half-filled can, 
feeling for the package, as the
fumes of rotting swill entered my 
nostrils. It felt unhealthy to my hand, 
and
the heavy package had sunk far down. 
Cursing, I pushed back my sleeve with
my clean hand and probed until I found 
it. Then I wiped off my arm with a
handkerchief and started away, aware of 
the people who paused to grin at
me.
"It serves you right," the little woman 
called from the stoop.
And I turned and started upward. 
"That's enough out of you, you

piece of yellow gone-to-waste. Unless 
you still want to call the police." My
voice had taken on a new shrill pitch. 
"I've done what you wanted me to do;
another word and I'll do what I want to 
do --"
She looked at me with widening eyes. "I 
believe you would," she
said, opening the door. "I believe you 
would."
"I not only would, I'd love it," I said.
"I can see that you're no gentleman," 
she called, slamming the door,
At the next row of cans I wiped off my 
wrist and hands with a piece
of newspaper, then wrapped the rest 
around the package. Next time I'd throw
it into the street.
Two blocks further along my anger had 
ebbed, but I felt strangely
lonely. Even the people who stood 
around me at the intersection seemed
isolated, each lost in his own 
thoughts. And now just as the lights 
changed I
let the package fall into the trampled 
snow and hurried across, thinking,
There, it's done.
I had covered two blocks when someone 
called behind me, "Say,
buddy! Hey, there! You, Mister . . . 
Wait a second!" and I could hear the
hurried crunching of footsteps upon the 
snow. Then he was beside me, a
squat man in worn clothes, the strands 
of his breath showing white in the
cold as he smiled at me, panting.
"You was moving so fast I thought I 
wasn't going to be able to stop
you," he said. "Didn't you lose 
something back there a piece?"
Oh, hell, a friend in need, I thought, 
deciding to deny it. "Lose
something?" I said. "Why, no."
"You sure?" he said, frowning.
"Yes," I said, seeing his forehead 
wrinkle with uncertainty, a hot
charge of fear leaping to his eyes as 
he searched my face.
"But I seen you -- Say, buddy," he 
said, looking swiftly back up the
street, "what you trying to do?"
"Do? What do you mean?"
"I mean talking 'bout you didn't lose 
nothing. You working a con
game or something?" He backed away, 
looking hurriedly at the pedestrians
back up the street from where he'd come.
"What on earth are you talking about 
now?" I said. "I tell you I
didn't lose anything."

"Man, don't tell me! I seen you. What 
the hell you mean?" he said,
furtively removing the package from his 
pocket. "This here feels like money or
a gun or something and I know damn well 
I seen you drop it."
"Oh, that," I said. "That isn't 
anything -- I thought you --"
"That's right, 'Oh.' So you remember 
now, don't you? I think I'm
doing you a favor and you play me for a 
fool. You some kind of confidence
man or dope peddler or something? You 
trying to work one of those pigeon
drops on me?"
"Pigeon drop?" I said. "You're making a 
mistake --"
"Mistake, hell! Take this damn stuff," 
he said, thrusting the package
in my hands as though it were a bomb 
with a lighted fuse. "I got a family,
man. I try to do you a favor and here 
you trying to get me into trouble -You 
running from a detective or somebody?"
"Wait a minute," I said. "You're 
letting your imagination run away;
this is nothing but garbage --"
"Don't try to hand me that 
simple-minded crap," he wheezed. "I
know what kind of garbage it is. You 
young New York Negroes is a blip! I
swear you is! I hope they catch you and 
put your ass under the jail!"
He shot away as though I had smallpox. 
I looked at the package. He
thinks it's a gun or stolen goods, I 
thought, watching him go. A few steps
farther along I was about to toss it 
boldly into the street when upon looking
back

I

saw

him,

joined

by

another

man

now,

gesturing

toward

me

indignantly. I hurried away. Give him 
time and the fool'll call a policeman. I
dropped the package back into the brief 
case. I'd wait until I got downtown.
On the subway people around me were 
reading their morning papers,
pressing forward their unpleasant 
faces. I rode with my eyes shut, trying 
to
make my mind blank to thoughts of Mary. 
Then turning, I saw the item
Violent Protest Over Harlem Eviction, 
just as the man lowered his paper and
moved out of the breaking doors. I 
could hardly wait until I reached 42nd
Street, where I found the story carried 
on the front page of a tabloid, and I
read it eagerly. I was referred to only 
as an unknown "rabble rouser" who
had

disappeared

in

the

excitement,

but

that

it

referred

to

me

was

unmistakable. It had lasted for two 
hours, the crowd refusing to vacate the
premises. I entered the clothing store 
with a new sense of self-importance.
I selected a more expensive suit than 
I'd intended, and while it was

being altered I picked up a hat, 
shorts, shoes, underwear and socks, then
hurried to call Brother Jack, who 
snapped his orders like a general. I 
was to
go to a number on the upper East Side 
where I'd find a room, and I was to
read over some of the Brotherhood's 
literature which had been left there for
me, with the idea of my making a speech 
at a Harlem rally to be held that
evening.
The address was that of an 
undistinguished building in a mixed
Spanish-Irish neighborhood, and there 
were boys throwing snowballs across
the street when I rang the super's 
bell. The door was opened by a small
pleasant-faced woman who smiled.
"Good morning, Brother," she said. "The 
apartment is all ready for
you. He said you'd come about this time 
and I've just this minute come
down. My, just look at that snow."
I followed her up the three flights of 
stairs, wondering what on earth
I'd do with a whole apartment.
"This is it," she said, removing a 
chain of keys from her pocket and
opening a door at the front of the 
hall. I went into a small comfortably
furnished room that was bright with the 
winter sun. "This is the living room,"
she said proudly, "and over here is 
your bedroom."
It was much larger than I needed, with 
a chest of drawers, two
upholstered chairs, two closets, a 
bookshelf and a desk on which was 
stacked
the literature to which he'd referred. 
A bathroom lay off the bedroom, and
there was a small kitchen.
"I hope you like it, Brother," she 
said, as she left. "If there's anything
you need, please ring my bell."
The apartment was clean and neat and I 
liked it -- especially the
bathroom with its tub and shower. And 
as quickly as I could I drew a bath
and soaked myself. Then feeling clean 
and exhilarated I went out to puzzle
over the Brotherhood books and 
pamphlets. My brief case with the broken
image lay on the table. I would get rid 
of the package later; right now I had
to think about tonight's rally.

Chapter 16
At seven-thirty Brother Jack and some 
of the others picked me up
and we shot up to Harlem in a taxi. As 
before, no one spoke a word. There
was only the sound made by a man in the 
corner who drew noisily on a
pipeful of rum-flavored tobacco, 
causing it to glow on and off, a red 
disk in
the dark. I rode with mounting 
nervousness; the taxi seemed unnaturally
warm. We got out in a side street and 
went down a narrow alley in the dark
to the rear of the huge, barn-like 
building. Other members had already
arrived.
"Ah, here we are," Brother Jack said, 
leading the way through a dark
rear door to a dressing room lighted by 
naked, low-hanging bulbs -- a small
room with wooden benches and a row of 
steel lockers with a network of
names scratched on the doors. It had a 
football-locker smell of ancient sweat,
iodine, blood and rubbing alcohol, and 
I felt a welling up of memories.
"We remain here until the building 
fills," Brother Jack said. "Then we
make our appearance -- just at the 
height of their impatience." He gave me 
a
grin. "Meanwhile, you think about what 
you'll say. Did you look over the
material?"
"All day," I said.
"Good. I suggest, however, that you 
listen carefully to the rest of us.
We'll all precede you so that you can 
get pointers for your remarks. You'll be
last."
I nodded, seeing him take two of the 
other men by the arm and
retreat to a corner. I was alone, the 
others were studying their notes, 
talking.
I went across the room to a torn 
photograph tacked to the faded wall. It 
was
a shot, in fighting stance, of a former 
prizefight champion, a popular fighter
who had lost his sight in the ring. It 
must have been right here in this
arena, I thought. That had been years 
ago. The photograph was that of a
man so dark and battered that he might 
have been of any nationality. Big
and loose-muscled, he looked like a 
good man. I remembered my father's
story of how he had been beaten blind 
in a crooked fight, of the scandal that
had been suppressed, and how the 
fighter had died in a home for the 
blind.
Who would have thought I'd ever come 
here? How things were twisted

around! I felt strangely sad and went 
and slouched on a bench. The others
talked on, their voices low. I watched 
them with a sudden resentment. Why
did I have to come last? What if they 
bored the audience to death before I
came on! I'd probably be shouted down 
before I could get started . . . But
perhaps not, I thought, jabbing my 
suspicions away. Perhaps I could make an
effect through the sheer contrast 
between my approach and theirs. Maybe 
that
was the strategy . . . Anyway, I had to 
trust them. I had to.
Still a nervousness clung to me. I felt 
out of place. From beyond the
door I could hear a distant scrape of 
chairs, a murmur of voices. Little
worries whirled up within me: That I 
might forget my new name; that I
might be recoginzed from the audience. 
I bent forward, suddenly conscious of
my legs in new blue trousers. But how 
do you know they're your legs? What's
your name? I thought, making a sad joke 
with myself. It was absurd, but it
relieved my nervousness. For it was as 
though I were looking at my own legs
for the first time -- independent 
objects that could of their own 
volition lead
me to safety or danger. I stared at the 
dusty floor. Then it was as though I
were returning after a long suspension 
of consciousness, as though I stood
simultaneously at opposite ends of a 
tunnel. I seemed to view myself from
the distance of the campus while yet 
sitting there on a bench in the old
arena; dressed in a new blue suit; 
sitting across the room from a group of
intense men who talked among themselves 
in hushed, edgy voices; while yet
in the distance I could hear the 
clatter of chairs, more voices, a 
cough. I
seemed aware of it all from a point 
deep within me, yet there was a
disturbing vagueness about what I saw, 
a disturbing unformed quality, as
when you see yourself in a photo 
exposed during adolescence: the 
expression
empty, the grin without character, the 
ears too large, the pimples, "courage
bumps," too many and too well-defined. 
This was a new phase, I realized, a
new beginning, and I would have to take 
that part of myself that looked on
with remote eyes and keep it always at 
the distance of the campus, the
hospital machine, the battle royal -- 
all now far behind. Perhaps the part of
me that observed listlessly but saw 
all, missing nothing, was still the
malicious, arguing part; the dissenting 
voice, my grandfather part; the cynical,
disbelieving part -- the traitor self 
that always threatened internal discord.
Whatever it was, I knew that I'd have 
to keep it pressed down. I had to. For
if I were successful tonight, I'd be on 
the road to something big. No more

flying apart at the seams, no more 
remembering forgotten pains . . . No, I
thought, shifting my body, they're the 
same legs on which I've come so far
from home. And yet they were somehow 
new. The new suit imparted a
newness to me. It was the clothes and 
the new name and the circumstances.
It was a newness too subtle to put into 
thought, but there it was. I was
becoming someone else.
I sensed vaguely and with a flash of 
panic that the moment I walked
out upon the platform and opened my 
mouth I'd be someone else. Not just a
nobody with a manufactured name which 
might have belonged to anyone, or
to no one. But another personality. Few 
people knew me now, but after
tonight . . . How was it? Perhaps 
simply to be known, to be looked upon by
so many people, to be the focal point 
of so many concentrating eyes, perhaps
this was enough to make one different; 
enough to transform one into
something else, someone else; just as 
by becoming an increasingly larger boy
one became one day a man; a man with a 
deep voice -- although my voice
had been deep since I was twelve. But 
what if someone from the campus
wandered into the audience? Or someone 
from Mary's -- even Mary herself?
"No, it wouldn't change it," I heard 
myself say softly, "that's all past." My
name was different; I was under orders. 
Even if I met Mary on the street, I'd
have to pass her by unrecognized. A 
depressing thought -- and I got up
abruptly and went out of the dressing 
room and into the alley.
Without my overcoat it was cold. A 
feeble light burned above the
entrance, sparkling the snow. I crossed 
the alley to the dark side, stopping
near a fence that smelled of carbolic 
acid, which, as I looked back across the
alley, caused me to remember a great 
abandoned hole that had been the site
of a sports arena that had burned 
before my birth. All that was left, a 
cliff
drop of some forty feet below the 
heat-buckled walk, was the shell of
concrete with weirdly bent and rusted 
rods that had been its basement. The
hole was used for dumping, and after a 
rain it stank with stagnant water.
And now in my mind I stood upon the 
walk looking out across the hole past
a Hooverville shanty of packing cases 
and bent tin signs, to a railroad yard
that lay beyond. Dark depthless water 
lay without motion in the hole, and
past the Hooverville a switch engine 
idled upon the shining rails, and as a
plume of white steam curled slowly from 
its funnel I saw a man come out of
the shanty and start up the path which 
led to the walk above. Stooped and

dark and sprouting rags from his shoes, 
hat and sleeves, he shuffled slowly
toward me, bringing a threatening cloud 
of carbolic acid. It was a syphilitic
who lived alone in the shanty between 
the hole and the railroad yard, coming
up to the street only to beg money for 
food and disinfectant with which to
soak his rags. Then in my mind I saw 
him stretching out a hand from which
the fingers had been eaten away and I 
ran -- back to the dark, and the cold
and the present.
I shivered, looking toward the street, 
where up the alley through the
tunneling

dark,

three

mounted

policemen

loomed

beneath

the

circular,

snow-sparkling beam of the street lamp, 
grasping their horses by their bridles,
the heads of both men and animals bent 
close, as though plotting; the leather
of saddles and leggings shining. Three 
white men and three black horses.
Then a car passed and they showed in 
full relief, their shadows flying like
dreams across the sparkle of snow and 
darkness. And, as I turned to leave,
one of the horses violently tossed its 
head and I saw the gauntleted fist
yanked down. Then there was a wild 
neigh and the horse plunged off in the
dark, the crisp, frantic clanking of 
metal and the stomping of hooves 
followed
me to the door. Perhaps this was 
something for Brother Jack to know.
But inside they were still in a huddle, 
and I went back and sat on
the bench.
I watched them, feeling very young and 
inexperienced and yet
strangely old, with an oldness that 
watched and waited quietly within me.
Outside, the audience had begun to 
drone; a distant, churning sound that
brought back some of the terror of the 
eviction. My mind flowed. There was
a child standing in rompers outside a 
chicken-wire fence, looking in upon a
huge black-and-white dog, log-chained 
to an apple tree. It was Master, the
bulldog; and I was the child who was 
afraid to touch him, although, panting
with heat, he seemed to grin back at me 
like a fat good-natured man, the
saliva roping silvery from his jowls. 
And as the voices of the crowd churned
and mounted and became an impatient 
splatter of hand claps, I thought of
Master's low hoarse growl. He had 
barked the same note when angry or
when being brought his dinner, when 
lazily snapping flies, or when tearing 
an
intruder to shreds. I liked, but didn't 
trust old Master; I wanted to please,
but did not trust the crowd. Then I 
looked at Brother Jack and grinned: That
was it; in some ways, he was like a toy 
bull terrier.

But now the roar and clapping of hands 
became a song and I saw
Brother Jack break off and bounce to 
the door. "Okay, Brothers," he said,
"that's our signal."
We went in a bunch, out of the dressing 
room and down a dim
passage aroar with the distant sound. 
Then it was brighter and I could see a
spotlight blazing the smoky haze. We 
moved silently, Brother Jack following
two very black Negroes and two white 
men who led the procession, and now
the roar of the crowd seemed to rise 
above us, flaring louder. I noticed the
others falling into columns of four, 
and I was alone in the rear, like the 
pivot
of a drill team. Ahead, a slanting 
shaft of brightness marked the entrance 
to
one of the levels of the arena, and now 
as we passed it the crowd let out a
roar. Then swiftly we were in the dark 
again, and climbing, the roar seeming
to sink below us and we were moved into 
a bright blue light and down a
ramp; to each side of which, stretching 
away in a curve, I could see rows of
blurred faces -- then suddenly I was 
blinded and felt myself crash into the
man ahead of me. "It always happens the 
first time," he shouted, stopping to
let me get my balance, his voice small 
in the roar. "It's the spotlight!"
It had picked us up now, and, beaming 
just ahead, led us into the
arena and encircled us full in its 
beam, the crowd thundering. The song 
burst
forth like a rocket to the marching 
tempo of clapping hands:
John Brown's body lies a-mold'ring in 
the grave
John Brown's body lies a-mold'ring in 
the grave
John Brown's body lies a-mold'ring in 
the grave
-- His soul is marching on!
Imagine that, I thought, they make the 
old song sound new. At first
I was as remote as though I stood in 
the highest balcony looking on. Then I
walked flush into the vibrations of the 
voices and felt an electric tingling
along my spine. We marched toward a 
flag-draped platform set near the front
of the arena, moving through an aisle 
left between rows of people in folding
chairs, then onto the platform past a 
number of women who stood when we
came on. With a nod Brother Jack 
indicated our chairs and we faced the
applause standing.
Below and above us was the audience, 
row after row of faces, the

arena a bowl-shaped aggregation of 
humanity. Then I saw the policemen and
was disturbed. What if they recognized 
me? They were all along the wall. I
touched the arm of the man ahead, 
seeing him turn, his mouth halting in a
verse of the song.
"Why all the police?" I said, leaning 
forward on the back of his
chair.
"Cops? Don't worry. Tonight they're 
ordered to protect us. This
meeting is of great political 
consequence!" he said, turning away.
Who ordered them to protect us? I 
thought -- But now the song was
ending and the building rang with 
applause, yells, until the chant burst 
from
the rear and spread:
No more dispossessing of the 
dispossessed!
No more dispossessing of the 
dispossessed!
The

audience

seemed

to

have

become

one,

its

breathing

and

articulation synchronized. I looked at 
Brother Jack. He stood up front beside
a microphone, his feet planted solidly 
on the dirty canvas-covered platform,
looking from side to side; his posture 
dignified and benign, like a bemused
father listening to the performance of 
his adoring children. I saw his hand go
up in a salute, and the audience 
thundered. And I seemed to move in 
close,
like the lens of a camera, focusing 
into the scene and feeling the heat and
excitement and the pounding of voice 
and applause against my diaphragm,
my eyes flying from face to face, 
swiftly, fleetingly, searching for 
someone I
could recognize, for someone from the 
old life, and seeing the faces become
vaguer and vaguer the farther they 
receded from the platform.
The speeches began. First an invocation 
by a Negro preacher; then a
woman spoke of what was happening to 
the children. Then came speeches on
various aspects of the economic and 
political situation. I listened 
carefully,
trying to snatch a phrase here, a word 
there, from the arsenal of hard,
precise terms. It was becoming a 
high-keyed evening. Songs flared between
speeches, chants exploded as 
spontaneously as shouts at a southern 
revival.
And I was somehow attuned to it all, 
could feel it physically. Sitting with 
my
feet on the soiled canvas I felt as 
though I had wandered into the 
percussion
section of a symphony orchestra. It 
worked on me so thoroughly that I soon

gave up trying to memorize phrases and 
simply allowed the excitement to
carry me along.
Someone pulled on my coat sleeve -- my 
turn had come. I went
toward the microphone where Brother 
Jack himself waited, entering the spot
of light that surrounded me like a 
seamless cage of stainless steel. I 
halted.
The light was so strong that I could no 
longer see the audience, the bowl of
human faces. It was as though a 
semi-transparent curtain had dropped
between us, but through which they 
could see me -- for they were applauding
-- without themselves being seen. I 
felt the hard, mechanical isolation of 
the
hospital machine and I didn't like it. 
I stood, barely hearing Brother Jack's
introduction. Then he was through and 
there was an encouraging burst of
applause. And I thought, They remember, 
some of them were there.
The

microphone

was

strange

and

unnerving.

I

approached

it

incorrectly, my voice sounding raspy 
and full of air, and after a few words I
halted, embarrassed. I was getting off 
to a bad start, something had to be
done. I leaned toward the vague 
audience closest to the platform and 
said,
"Sorry, folks. Up to now they've kept 
me so far away from these shiny
electric gadgets I haven't learned the 
technique . . . And to tell you the 
truth,
it looks to me like it might bite! Just 
look at it, it looks like the steel 
skull
of a man! Do you think he died of 
dispossession?"
It worked and while they laughed 
someone came and made an
adjustment. "Don't stand too close," he 
advised.
"How's that?" I said, hearing my voice 
boom deep and vibrant over
the arena. "Is that better?"
There was a ripple of applause.
"You see, all I needed was a chance. 
You've granted it, now it's up
to me!"
The applause grew stronger and from 
down front a man's far-carrying
voice called out, "We with you, 
Brother. You pitch 'em we catch 'em!"
That was all I needed, I'd made a 
contact, and it was as though his
voice was that of them all. I was wound 
up, nervous. I might have been
anyone, might have been trying to speak 
in a foreign language. For I couldn't
remember the correct words and phrases 
from the pamphlets. I had to fall
back upon tradition and since it was a 
political meeting, I selected one of the
political techniques that I'd heard so 
often at home: The old down-to-earth,

I'm-sick-and-tired-of-the-way-they've-be
en-treating-us approach. I couldn't see
them so I addressed the microphone and 
the co-operative voice before me.
"You know, there are those who think we 
who are gathered here are
dumb," I shouted. "Tell me if I'm 
right."
"That's a strike, Brother," the voice 
called. "You pitched a strike."
"Yes, they think we're dumb. They call 
us the 'common people.' But
I've been sitting here listening and 
looking and trying to understand what's 
so
common about us. I think they're guilty 
of a gross mis-statement of fact -we 
are the uncommon people --"
"Another strike," the voice called in 
the thunder, and I paused
holding up my hand to halt the noise.
"Yes, we're the uncommon people -- and 
I'll tell you why. They call
us dumb and they treat us dumb. And 
what do they do with dumb ones?
Think about it, look around! They've 
got a slogan and a policy. They've got
what Brother Jack would call a 'theory 
and a practice.' It's 'Never give a
sucker an even break!' It's dispossess 
him! Evict him! Use his empty head for
a spittoon and his back for a door mat! 
It's break him! Deprive him of his
wages! It's use his protest as a 
sounding brass to frighten him into 
silence,
it's beat his ideas and his hopes and 
homely aspirations, into a tinkling
cymbal! A small, cracked cymbal to 
tinkle on the Fourth of July! Only 
muffle
it! Don't let it sound too loud! Beat 
it in stoptime, give the dumb bunnies
the soft-shoe dance! The Big Wormy 
Apple, The Chicago Get Away, the Shoo
Fly Don't Bother Me!
"And do you know what makes us so 
uncommon?" I whispered
hoarsely. "We let them do it."
The silence was profound. The smoke 
boiled in the spotlight.
"Another strike," I heard the voice 
call sadly. "Ain't no use to protest
the decision!" And I thought, Is he 
with me or against me?
"Dispossession! Dis-possession is the 
word!" I went on. "They've tried
to dispossess us of our manhood and 
womanhood! Of our childhood and
adolescence -- You heard the sister's 
statistics on our infant mortality rate.
Don't you know you're lucky to be 
uncommonly born? Why, they even tried
to dispossess us of our dislike of 
being dispossessed! And I'll tell you
something else -- if we don't resist, 
pretty soon they'll succeed! These are 
the
days of dispossession, the season of 
homelessness, the time of evictions. 
We'll

be dispossessed of the very brains in 
our heads! And we're so uncommon
that we can't even see it! Perhaps 
we're too polite. Perhaps we don't care 
to
look at unpleasantness. They think 
we're blind -- uncommonly blind. And I
don't wonder. Think about it, they've 
dispossessed us each of one eye from
the day we're born. So now we can only 
see in straight white lines. We're a
nation of one-eyed mice -- Did you ever 
see such a sight in your life? Such
an uncommon sight!"
"An' ain't a farmer's wife in the 
house," the voice called through the
titters of bitter laughter. "It's 
another strike!"
I leaned forward. "You know, if we 
aren't careful, they'll slip up on
our blind sides and -- plop! out goes 
our last good eye and we're blind as
bats! Someone's afraid we'll see 
something. Maybe that's why so many of 
our
fine friends are present tonight -- 
blue steel pistols and blue serge suits 
and
all! -- but I believe one eye is enough 
to lose without resistance and I think
that's your belief. So let's get 
together. Did you ever notice, my dumb
one-eyed brothers, how two totally 
blind men can get together and help one
another along? They stumble, they bump 
into things, but they avoid dangers
too; they get along. Let's get 
together, uncommon people. With both 
our eyes
we may see what makes us so uncommon, 
we'll see who makes us so
uncommon! Up to now we've been like a 
couple of one-eyed men walking
down opposite sides of the street. 
Someone starts throwing bricks and we
start blaming each other and fighting 
among ourselves. But we're mistaken!
Because there's a third party present. 
There's a smooth, oily scoundrel
running down the middle of the wide 
gray street throwing stones -- He's the
one! He's doing the damage! He claims 
he needs the space -- he calls it his
freedom. And he knows he's got us on 
our blind side and he's been popping
away till he's got us silly -- 
uncommonly silly! In fact, In fact, his 
freedom
has got us damn-nigh blind! Hush now, 
don't call no names!" I called,
holding up my palm. "I say to hell with 
this guy! I say come on, cross over!
Let's make an alliance! I'll look out 
for you, and you look out for me! I'm
good at catching and I've got a damn 
good pitching arm!"
"You don't pitch no balls, Brother! Not 
a single one!"
"Let's make a miracle," I shouted. 
"Let's take back our pillaged eyes!
Let's reclaim our sight; let's combine 
and spread our vision. Peep around the
corner, there's a storm coming. Look 
down the avenue, there's only one

enemy. Can't you see his face?"
It was a natural pause and there was 
applause, but as it burst I
realized that the flow of words had 
stopped. What would I do when they
started to listen again? I leaned 
forward, straining to see through the 
barrier
of light. They were mine, out there, 
and I couldn't afford to lose them. Yet 
I
suddenly

felt

naked,

sensing

that

the

words

were

returning

and

that

something was about to be said that I 
shouldn't reveal.
"Look at me!" The words ripped from my 
solar plexus. "I haven't
lived here long. Times are hard, I've 
known despair. I'm from the South, and
since coming here I've known eviction. 
I'd come to distrust the world . . .
But look at me now, something strange 
is happening. I'm here before you. I
must confess . . ."
And suddenly Brother Jack was beside 
me, pretending to adjust the
microphone. "Careful now," he 
whispered. "Don't end your usefulness 
before
you've begun."
"I'm all right," I said, leaning toward 
the mike.
"May I confess?" I shouted. "You are my 
friends. We share a
common disinheritance, and it's said 
that confession is good for the soul.
Have I your permission?"
"Your batting .500, Brother," the voice 
called.
There was a stir behind me. I waited 
until it was quiet and hurried
on.
"Silence is consent," I said, "so I'll 
have it out, I'll confess it!" My
shoulders were squared, my chin thrust 
forward and my eyes focused straight
into the light. "Something strange and 
miraculous and transforming is taking
place in me right now . . . as I stand 
here before you!"
I could feel the words forming 
themselves, slowly falling into place.
The light seemed to boil opalescently, 
like liquid soap shaken gently in a
bottle.
"Let me describe it. It is something 
odd. It's something that I'm sure
I'd never experience anywhere else in 
the world. I feel your eyes upon me. I
hear the pulse of your breathing. And 
now, at this moment, with your black
and white eyes upon me, I feel . . . I 
feel . . ."
I stumbled in a stillness so complete 
that I could hear the gears of
the huge clock mounted somewhere on the 
balcony gnawing upon time.

"What is it, son, what do you feel?" a 
shrill voice cried.
My voice fell to a husky whisper, "I 
feel, I feel suddenly that I have
become more human. Do you understand? 
More human. Not that I have
become a man, for I was born a man. But 
that I am more human. I feel
strong, I feel able to get things done! 
I feel that I can see sharp and clear
and far down the dim corridor of 
history and in it I can hear the 
footsteps
of militant fraternity! No, wait, let 
me confess . . . I feel the urge to 
affirm
my feelings . . . I feel that here, 
after a long and desperate and 
uncommonly
blind journey, I have come home . . . 
Home! With your eyes upon me I feel
that I've found my true family! My true 
people! My true country! I am a new
citizen of the country of your vision, 
a native of your fraternal land. I feel
that here tonight, in this old arena, 
the new is being born and the vital old
revived. In each of you, in me, in us 
all.
"SISTERS! BROTHERS!
"WE ARE THE TRUE PATRIOTS! THE CITIZENS 
OF TOMORROW'S
WORLD!
"WE'LL BE DISPOSSESSED NO MORE!"
The applause struck like a clap of 
thunder. I stood, transfixed, unable
to see, my body quivering with the 
roar. I made an indefinite movement.
What should I do -- wave to them? I 
faced the shouts, cheers, shrill
whistling, my eyes burning from the 
light. I felt a large tear roll down my
face and I wiped it away with 
embarrassment. Others were starting 
down.
Why didn't someone help me get out of 
the spot before I spoiled everything?
But with the tears came an increase of 
applause and I lifted my head,
surprised, my eyes streaming. The sound 
seemed to roar up in waves. They
had begun to stomp the floor and I was 
laughing and bowing my head now
unashamed. It grew in volume, the sound 
of splitting wood came from the
rear. I grew tired, but still they 
cheered until, finally, I gave up and 
started
back toward the chairs. Red spots 
danced before my eyes. Someone took my
hand, and leaned toward my ear.
"You did it, goddamnit! You did it!" 
And I was puzzled by the hot
mixture of hate and admiration bursting 
through his words as I thanked him
and removed my hand from his crushing 
grasp.
"Thanks," I said, "but the others had 
raised them to the right pitch."
I shuddered; he sounded as though he 
would like to throttle me. I

couldn't see and there was much 
confusion and suddenly someone spun me
around, pulling me off balance, and I 
felt myself pressed against warm
feminine softness, holding on.
"Oh, Brother, Brother!" a woman's voice 
cried into my ear, "Little
Brother!" and I felt the hot moist 
pressure of her lips upon my cheek.
Blurred figures bumped about me. I 
stumbled as in a game of
blindman's buff. My hands were shaken, 
my back pounded. My face was
sprayed with the saliva of enthusiasm, 
and I decided that the next time I
stood in the spotlight it would be wise 
to wear dark glasses.
It was a deafening demonstration. We 
left them cheering, knocking
over chairs, stomping the floor. 
Brother Jack guided me off the 
platform. "It's
time we left," he shouted. "Things have 
truly begun to move. All that energy
must be organized!"
He guided me through the shouting 
crowd, hands continuing to touch
me as I stumbled along. Then we entered 
the dark passage and when we
reached the end the spots faded from my 
eyes and I began to see again.
Brother Jack paused at the door.
"Listen to them," he said. "Just 
waiting to be told what to do!" And
I could still hear the applause booming 
behind us. Then several of the others
broke off their conversation and faced 
us, as the applause muffled down
behind the closing door.
"Well, what do you think?" Brother Jack 
said enthusiastically. "How's
that for a starter?"
There was a tense silence. I looked 
from face to face, black and
white, feeling swift panic. They were 
grim.
"Well?" Brother Jack said, his voice 
suddenly hard.
I could hear the creaking of someone's 
shoes.
"Well?" he repeated.
Then the man with the pipe spoke up, a 
swift charge of tension
building with his words.
"It was a most unsatisfactory 
beginning," he said quietly, punctuating
the "unsatisfactory" with a stab of his 
pipe. He was looking straight at me
and I was puzzled. I looked at the 
others. Their faces were noncommittal,
stolid.
"Unsatisfactory!" Brother Jack 
exploded. "And what alleged process of

thought led to that brilliant 
pronouncement?"
"This is no time for cheap sarcasm, 
Brother," the brother with the
pipe said.
"Sarcasm? You made the sarcasm. No, it 
isn't a time for sarcasms
nor for imbecilities. Nor for plain 
damn-fooleries! This is a key moment in
the struggle, things have just begun to 
move -- and suddenly you are
unhappy. You are afraid of success? 
What's wrong? Isn't this just what we've
been working for?"
"Again, ask yourself. You are the great 
leader. Look into your crystal
ball."
Brother Jack swore.
"Brothers!" someone said.
Brother Jack swore and swung to another 
brother. "You," he said to
the husky man. "Have you the courage to 
tell me what's going on here? Have
we become a street-corner gang?"
Silence. Someone shuffled his feet. The 
man with the pipe was
looking now at me.
"Did I do something wrong?" I said.
"The worst you could have done," he 
said coldly.
Stunned, I looked at him wordlessly.
"Never mind," Brother Jack said, 
suddenly calm. "Just what is the
problem, Brother? Let's have it out 
right here. Just what is your 
complaint?"
"Not a complaint, an opinion. If we are 
still allowed to express our
opinions," the brother with the pipe 
said.
"Your opinion, then," Brother Jack said.
"In

my

opinion

the

speech

was

wild,

hysterical,

politically

irresponsible and dangerous," he 
snapped. "And worse than that, it was
incorrect!" He pronounced "incorrect" 
as though the term described the most
heinous crime imaginable, and I stared 
at him open-mouthed, feeling a vague
guilt.
"Soooo," Brother Jack said, looking 
from face to face, "there's been a
caucus and decisions have been made. 
Did you take minutes, Brother
Chairman? Have you recorded your wise 
disputations?"
"There was no caucus and the opinion 
still holds," the brother with
the pipe said.

"No meeting, but just the same there 
has been a caucus and
decisions have been reached even before 
the event is finished."
"But, Brother," someone tried to 
intervene.
"A most brilliant, operation," Brother 
Jack went on, smiling now. "A
consummate example of skilled 
theoretical Nijinskys leaping ahead of 
history.
But come down. Brothers, come down or 
you'll land on your dialectics; the
stage of history hasn't built that far. 
The month after next, perhaps, but not
yet. And what do you think, Brother 
Wrestrum?" he asked, pointing to a big
fellow of the shape and size of 
Supercargo.
"I think the brother's speech was 
backward and reactionary!" he said.
I wanted to answer but could not. No 
wonder his voice had sounded
so mixed when he congratulated me. I 
could only stare into the broad face
with its hate-burning eyes.
"And you," Brother Jack said.
"I liked the speech," the man said, "I 
thought it was quite effective."
"And you?" Brother Jack said to the 
next man.
"I am of the opinion that it was a 
mistake."
"And just why?"
"Because we must strive to reach the 
people through their intelligence
. . ."
"Exactly," the brother with the pipe 
said. "It was the antithesis of the
scientific approach. Ours is a 
reasonable point of view. We are 
champions of
a scientific approach to society, and 
such a speech as we've identified
ourselves with tonight destroys 
everything that has been said before. 
The
audience isn't thinking, it's yelling 
its head off."
"Sure, it's acting like a mob," the big 
black brother said.
Brother Jack laughed. "And this mob," 
he said, "Is it a mob against
us, or is it a mob for us -- how do our 
muscle-bound scientists answer that?"
But before they could answer he 
continued, "Perhaps you're right,
perhaps it is a mob; but if it is, then 
it seems to be a mob that's simply
boiling over to come along with us. And 
I shouldn't have to tell you
theoreticians

that

science

bases

its

judgments

upon

experiment!

You're

jumping to conclusions before the 
experiment has run its course. In fact,
what's happening here tonight 
represents only one step in the 
experiment.
The initial step, the release of 
energy. I can understand that it should 
make

you timid -- you're afraid of carrying 
through to the next step -- because it's
up to you to organize that energy. 
Well, it's going to be organized and 
not by
a bunch of timid sideline theoreticians 
arguing in a vacuum, but by getting
out and leading the people!"
He was fighting mad, looking from face 
to face, his red head
bristling, but no one answered his 
challenge.
"It's disgusting," he said, pointing to 
me. "Our new brother has
succeeded by instinct where for two 
years your 'science' has failed, and now
all you can offer is destructive 
criticism."
"I beg to differ," the brother with the 
pipe said. "To point out the
dangerous nature of his speech isn't 
destructive criticism. Far from it. Like
the rest of us, the new brother must 
learn to speak scientifically. He must 
be
trained!"
"So at last it occurs to you," Brother 
Jack said, pulling down the
corners of his mouth. "Training. All is 
not lost. There's hope that our wild
but effective speaker may be tamed. The 
scientists perceive a possibility! Very
well,

it

has

been

arranged;

perhaps

not

scientifically

but

arranged

nevertheless. For the next few months 
our new brother is to undergo a period
of intense study and indoctrination 
under the guidance of Brother Hambro.
That's right," he said, as I started to 
speak. "I meant to tell you later."
"But that's a long time," I said. "How 
am I going to live?"
"Your salary will continue," he said. 
"Meanwhile, you'll be guilty of
no further unscientific speeches to 
upset our brothers' scientific 
tranquillity. In
fact, you are to stay completely out of 
Harlem. Perhaps then we'll see if you
brothers are as swift at organizing as 
you are at criticizing. It's your move,
Brothers."
"I think Brother Jack is correct," a 
short, bald man said. "And I
don't think

that we, of

all people, should be afraid of

the people's

enthusiasm. What we've got to do is to 
guide it into channels where it will
do the most good."
The rest were silent, the brother with 
the pipe looking at me
unbendingly.
"Come," Brother Jack said. "Let's get 
out of here. If we keep our
eyes on the real goal our chances are 
better than ever before. And let's
remember that science isn't a game of 
chess, although chess may be played

scientifically. The other thing to 
remember is that if we are to organize 
the
masses we must first organize 
ourselves. Thanks to our new brother, 
things
have changed; we mustn't fail to make 
use of our opportunity. From now on
it's up to you."
"We shall see," the brother with the 
pipe said. "And as for the new
brother, a few talks with Brother 
Hambro wouldn't harm anyone."
Hambro, I thought, going out, who the 
hell is he? I suppose I'm
lucky they didn't fire me. So now I've 
got to go to school again.
Out in the night the group was breaking 
up and Brother Jack drew
me aside. "Don't worry," he said. 
"You'll find Brother Hambro 
interesting, and
a period of training was inevitable. 
Your speech tonight was a test which you
passed with flying colors, so now 
you'll be prepared for some real work.
Here's the address; see Brother Hambro 
the first thing in the morning. He's
already been notified."
When I reached home, tiredness seemed 
to explode within me. My
nerves remained tense even after I had 
had a hot shower and crawled into
bed. In my disappointment, I wanted 
only to sleep, but my mind kept
wandering back to the rally. It had 
actually happened. I had been lucky and
had said the right things at the right 
time and they had liked me. Or perhaps
I had said the wrong things in the 
right places -- whatever, they had 
liked it
regardless of the brothers, and from 
now on my life would be different. It
was different already. For now I 
realized that I meant everything that I 
had
said to the audience, even though I 
hadn't known that I was going to say
those things. I had intended only to 
make a good appearance, to say enough
to keep the Brotherhood interested in 
me. What had come out was completely
uncalculated, as though another self 
within me had taken over and held forth.
And lucky that it had, or I might have 
been fired.
Even my technique had been different; 
no one who had known me at
college would have recognized the 
speech. But that was as it should have
been, for I was someone new -- even 
though I had spoken in a very
old-fashioned way. I had been 
transformed, and now, lying restlessly 
in bed
in the dark, I felt a kind of affection 
for the blurred audience whose faces I
had never clearly seen. They had been 
with me from the first word. They had
wanted me to succeed, and fortunately I 
had spoken for them and they had
recognized my words. I belonged to 
them. I sat up, grasping my knees in the

dark as the thought struck home. 
Perhaps this was what was meant by being
"dedicated and set aside." Very well, 
if so, I accepted it. My possibilities 
were
suddenly broadened. As a Brotherhood 
spokesman I would represent not only
my own group but one that was much 
larger. The audience was mixed, their
claims broader than race. I would do 
whatever was necessary to serve them
well. If they could take a chance with 
me, then I'd do the very best that I
could. How else could I save myself 
from disintegration?
I sat there in the dark trying to 
recall the sequence of the speech.
Already it seemed the expression of 
someone else. Yet I knew that it was
mine and mine alone, and if it was 
recorded by a stenographer, I would have
a look at it tomorrow.
Words, phrases skipped through my mind; 
I saw the blue haze again.
What had I meant by saying that I had 
become "more human"? Was it a
phrase that I had picked up from some 
preceding speaker, or a slip of the
tongue? For a moment I thought of my 
grandfather and quickly dismissed
him. What had an old slave to do with 
humanity? Perhaps it was something
that Woodridge had said in the 
literature class back at college. I 
could see
him vividly, half-drunk on words and 
full of contempt and exaltation, pacing
before the blackboard chalked with 
quotations from Joyce and Yeats and Sean
O'Casey; thin, nervous, neat, pacing as 
though he walked a high wire of
meaning upon which no one of us would 
ever dare venture. I could hear
him: "Stephen's problem, like ours, was 
not actually one of creating the
uncreated conscience of his race, but 
of creating the uncreated features of 
his
face. Our task is that of making 
ourselves individuals. The conscience 
of a
race is the gift of its individuals who 
see, evaluate, record . . . We create 
the
race by creating ourselves and then to 
our great astonishment we will have
created something far more important: 
We will have created a culture. Why
waste time creating a conscience for 
something that doesn't exist? For, you
see, blood and skin do not think!"
But no, it wasn't Woodridge. "More 
human" . . . Did I mean that I
had become less of what I was, less a 
Negro, or that I was less a being
apart; less an exile from down home, 
the South? . . . But all this is 
negative.
To become less -- in order to become 
more? Perhaps that was it, but in what
way more human? Even Woodridge hadn't 
spoken of such things. It was a
mystery once more, as at the eviction I 
had uttered words that had possessed

me.
I thought of Bledsoe and Norton and 
what they had done. By kicking
me into the dark they'd made me see the 
possibility of achieving something
greater and more important than I'd 
ever dreamed. Here was a way that
didn't lead through the back door, a 
way not limited by black and white, but
a way which, if one lived long enough 
and worked hard enough, could lead
to the highest possible rewards. Here 
was a way to have a part in making
the big decisions, of seeing through 
the mystery of how the country, the
world, really operated. For the first 
time, lying there in the dark, I could
glimpse the possibility of being more 
than a member of a race. It was no
dream, the possibility existed. I had 
only to work and learn and survive in
order to go to the top. Sure I'd study 
with Hambro, I'd learn what he had to
teach and a lot more. Let tomorrow 
come. The sooner I was through with
this Hambro, the sooner I could get 
started with my work.

Chapter 17
Four months later when Brother Jack 
called the apartment at
midnight to tell me to be prepared to 
take a ride I became quite excited.
Fortunately, I was awake and dressed, 
and when he drove up a few minutes
later I was waiting expectantly at the 
curb. Maybe, I thought, as I saw him
hunched behind the wheel in his 
topcoat, this is what I've been waiting 
for.
"How have you been, Brother?" I said, 
getting in.
"A little tired," he said. "Not enough 
sleep, too many problems."
Then, as he got the car under way, he 
became silent, and I decided
not to ask any questions. That was one 
thing I had learned thoroughly. There
must be something doing at the 
Chthonian, I thought, watching him 
staring
at the road as though lost in thought. 
Maybe the brothers are waiting to put
me through my paces. If so, fine; I've 
been waiting for an examination . . .
But instead of going to the Chthonian I 
looked out to discover that
he had brought me to Harlem and was 
parking the car.

"We'll have a drink," he said, getting 
out and heading for where the
neon-lighted sign of a bull's head 
announced the El Toro Bar.
I was disappointed. I wanted no drink; 
I wanted to take the next
step that lay between me and an 
assignment. I followed him inside with a
surge of irritation.
The barroom was warm and quiet. The 
usual rows of bottles with
exotic names were lined on the shelves, 
and in the rear, where four men
argued in Spanish over glasses of beer, 
a juke box, lit up green and red,
played "Media Luz." And as we waited 
for the bartender, I tried to figure the
purpose of the trip.
I had seen very little of Brother Jack 
after beginning my studies with
Brother Hambro. My life had been too 
tightly organized. But I should have
known that if anything was going to 
happen, Brother Hambro would have let
me know. Instead, I was to meet him in 
the morning as usual. That Hambro,
I thought, is he a fanatic teacher! A 
tall, friendly man, a lawyer and the
Brotherhood's chief theoretician, he 
had proved to be a hard taskmaster.
Between daily discussions with him and 
a rigid schedule of reading, I had
been working harder than I'd ever found 
necessary at college. Even my nights
were organized; every evening found me 
at some rally or meeting in one of
the many districts (though this was my 
first trip to Harlem since my speech)
where I'd sit on the platform with the 
speakers, making notes to be discussed
with him the next day. Every occasion 
became a study situation, even the
parties that sometimes followed the 
meetings. During these I had to make
mental notes on the ideological 
attitudes revealed in the guests' 
conversations.
But I had soon learned the method in 
it: Not only had I been learning the
many aspects of the Brotherhood's 
policy and its approach to various 
social
groupings, but the city-wide membership 
had grown familiar with me. My
part in the eviction was kept very much 
alive, and although I was under
orders to make no speeches, I had grown 
accustomed to being introduced as
a kind of hero.
Yet it had been mainly a time for 
listening and, being a talker, I had
grown impatient. Now I knew most of the 
Brotherhood arguments so well -those I 
doubted as well as those I believed -- 
that I could repeat them in my
sleep, but nothing had been said about 
my assignment. Thus I had hoped the
midnight call meant some kind of action 
was to begin . . .

Beside me, Brother Jack was still lost 
in thought. He seemed in no
hurry to go elsewhere or to talk, and 
as the slow-motion bartender mixed our
drinks I puzzled vainly as to why he 
had brought me here. Before me, in the
panel where a mirror is usually placed, 
I could see a scene from a bullfight,
the bull charging close to the man and 
the man swinging the red cape in
sculptured folds so close to his body 
that man and bull seemed to blend in
one swirl of calm, pure motion. Pure 
grace, I thought, looking above the bar
to where, larger than life, the pink 
and white image of a girl smiled down
from a summery beer ad on which a 
calendar said April One. Then, as our
drinks were placed before us, Brother 
Jack came alive, his mood changing as
though in the instant he had settled 
whatever had been bothering him and
felt suddenly free.
"Here, come back," he said, nudging me 
playfully. "She's only a
cardboard image of a cold steel 
civilization."
I laughed, glad to hear him joking. 
"And that?" I said, pointing to
the bullfight scene.
"Sheer barbarism," he said, watching 
the bartender and lowering his
voice to a whisper. "But tell me, how 
have you found your work with Brother
Hambro?"
"Oh, fine," I said. "He's strict, but 
if I'd had teachers like him in
college, I'd know a few things. He's 
taught me a lot, but whether enough to
satisfy the brothers who disliked my 
arena speech, I don't know. Shall we
converse scientifically?"
He laughed, one of his eyes glowing 
brighter than the other. "Don't
worry about the brothers," he said. 
"You'll do very well. Brother Hambro's
reports on you have been excellent."
"Now, that's nice to hear," I.said, 
aware now of another bullfight
scene further down the bar in which the 
matador was being swept skyward
on the black bull's horns. "I've worked 
pretty hard trying to master the
ideology."
"Master it," Brother Jack said, "but 
don't overdo it. Don't let it
master you. There is nothing to put the 
people to sleep like dry ideology. The
ideal is to strike a medium between 
ideology and inspiration. Say what the
people want to hear, but say it in such 
a way that they'll do what we wish."
He laughed. "Remember too, that theory 
always comes after practice. Act first,

theorize later; that's also a formula, 
a devastatingly effective one!"
He looked at me as though he did not 
see me and I could not tell
whether he was laughing at me or with 
me. I was sure only that he was
laughing.
"Yes," I said, "I'll try to master all 
that is required."
"You can," he said. "And now you don't 
have to worry about the
brothers' criticism. Just throw some 
ideology back at them and they'll leave
you alone -- provided, of course, that 
you have the right backing and produce
the required results. Another drink?"
"Thanks, I've had enough."
"Are you sure?"
"Sure."
"Good. Now to your assignment: Tomorrow 
you are to become chief
spokesman of the Harlem District . . ."
"What!"
"Yes. The committee decided yesterday."
"But I had no idea."
"You'll do all right. Now listen. You 
are to continue what you started
at the eviction. Keep them stirred up. 
Get them active. Get as many to join
as possible. You'll be given guidance 
by some of the older members, but for
the time being you are to see what you 
can do. You will have freedom of
action -- and you will be under strict 
discipline to the committee."
"I see," I said.
"No, you don't quite see," he said, 
"but you will. You must not
underestimate the discipline, Brother. 
It makes you answerable to the entire
organization for what you do. Don't 
underestimate the discipline. It is very
strict, but within its framework you 
are to have full freedom to do your 
work.
And your work is very important. 
Understand?" His eyes seemed to crowd my
face as I nodded yes. "We'd better go 
now so that you can get some sleep,"
he said, draining his glass. "You're a 
soldier now, your health belongs to the
organization."
"I'll be ready," I said.
"I know you will. Until tomorrow then. 
You'll meet with the executive
committee of the Harlem section at nine 
A.M. You know the location of
course?"

"No, Brother, I don't."
"Oh? That's right -- then you'd better 
come up with me for a minute.
I have to see someone there and you can 
take a look at where you'll work.
I'll drop you off on the way down," he 
said.

THE district offices were located in a 
converted church structure, the
main floor of which was occupied by a 
pawn shop, its window crammed with
loot that gleamed dully in the darkened 
street. We took a stair to the third
floor, entering a large room beneath a 
high Gothic ceiling.
"It's down here," Brother Jack said, 
making for the end of the large
room where I saw a row of smaller ones, 
only one of which was lighted. And
now I saw a man appear in the door and 
limp forward.
"Evening, Brother Jack," he said.
"Why, Brother Tarp, I expected to find 
Brother Tobitt."
"I know. He was here but he had to 
leave," the man said. "He left
this envelope for you and said he'd 
call you later on tonight."
"Good, good," Brother Jack said. "Here, 
meet a new brother . . ."
"Pleased to meet you," the brother 
said, smiling. "I heard you speak
at the arena. You really told 'em."
"Thanks," I said.
"So you liked it, did you, Brother 
Tarp?" Brother Jack said.
"The boy's all right with me," the man 
said.
"Well, you're going to see a lot of 
him, he's your new spokesman."
"That's fine," the man said. "Looks 
like we're going to get some
changes made."
"Correct," Brother Jack said. "Now 
let's take a look at his office and
we'll be going."
"Sure, Brother," Tarp said, limping 
before me into one of the dark
rooms and snapping on a light. "This 
here is the one."
I looked into a small office, 
containing a flat-top desk with a
telephone, a typewriter on its table, a 
bookcase with shelves of books and
pamphlets, and a huge map of the world 
inscribed with ancient nautical signs
and a heroic figure of Columbus to one 
side.
"If there's anything you need, just see 
Brother Tarp," Brother Jack

said. "He's here at all times."
"Thanks, I shall," I said. "I'll get 
oriented in the morning."
"Yes, and we'd better go so you can get 
some sleep. Good night,
Brother Tarp. See that everything is 
ready for him in the morning."
"He won't have to worry about a thing, 
Brother. Good night."
"It's because we attract men like 
Brother Tarp there that we shall
triumph," he said as we climbed into 
the car. "He's old physically, but
ideologically he's a vigorous young 
man. He can be depended upon in the
most precarious circumstance."
"He sounds like a good man to have 
around," I said.
"You'll see," he said and lapsed into a 
silence that lasted until we
reached my door.

THE committee was assembled in the hall 
with the high Gothic
ceiling when I arrived, sitting in 
folding chairs around two small tables
pushed together to form a unit.
"Well," Brother Jack said, "you are on 
time. Very good, we favor
precision in our leaders."
"Brother, I shall always try to be on 
time," I said.
"Here he is, Brothers and Sisters," he 
said, "your new spokesman.
Now to begin. Are we all present?"
"All except Brother Tod Clifton," 
someone said.
His red head jerked with surprise. "So?"
"He'll be here," a young brother said. 
"We were working until three
this morning."
"Still, he should be on time -- Very 
well," Brother Jack said, taking
out a watch, "let us begin. I have only 
a little time here, but a little time is
all that is needed. You all know the 
events of the recent period, and the 
role
our new brother has played in them. 
Briefly, you are here to see that it 
isn't
wasted. We must achieve two things: We 
must plan methods of increasing the
effectiveness of our agitation, and we 
must organize the energy that has
already been released. This calls for a 
rapid increase of membership. The
people are fully aroused; if we fail to 
lead them into action, they will become
passive, or they will become cynical. 
Thus it is necessary that we strike

immediately and strike hard!
"For this purpose," he said, nodding 
toward me, "our brother has
been appointed district spokesman. You 
are to give him your loyal support
and regard him as the new instrument of 
the committee's authority . . ."
I heard the slight applause splatter up 
-- only to halt with the
opening of the door, and I looked down 
past the rows of chairs to where a
hatless young man about my own age was 
coming into the hall. He wore a
heavy sweater and slacks, and as the 
others looked up I heard the quick
intake of a woman's pleasurable sigh. 
Then the young man was moving with
an easy Negro stride out of the shadow 
into the light, and I saw that he was
very black and very handsome, and as he 
advanced mid-distance into the
room, that he possessed the chiseled, 
black-marble features sometimes found
on statues in northern museums and 
alive in southern towns in which the
white offspring of house children and 
the black offspring of yard children
bear names, features and character 
traits as identical as the rifling of 
bullets
fired from a common barrel. And now 
close up, leaning tall and relaxed, his
arms outstretched stiffly upon the 
table, I saw the broad, taut span of his
knuckles upon the dark grain of the 
wood, the muscular, sweatered arms, the
curving line of the chest rising to the 
easy pulsing of his throat, to the
square, smooth chin, and saw a small 
X-shaped patch of adhesive upon the
subtly blended, velvet-over-stone, 
granite-over-bone, Afro-Anglo-Saxon 
contour
of his cheek.
He leaned there, looking at us all with 
a remote aloofness in which I
sensed an unstated questioning beneath 
a friendly charm. Sensing a possible
rival, I watched him warily, wondering 
who he was.
"Ah so, Brother Tod Clifton is late," 
Brother Jack said. "Our leader of
the youth is late. Why is this?"
The young man pointed to his cheek and 
smiled. "I had to see the
doctor," he said.
"What is this?" Brother Jack said, 
looking at the cross of adhesive on
the black skin.
"Just a little encounter with the 
nationalists. With Ras the Exhorter's
boys," Brother Clifton said. And I 
heard a gasp from one of the women who
gazed at him with shining, 
compassionate eyes.
Brother Jack gave me a quick look. 
"Brother, you have heard of Ras?

He is the wild man who calls himself a 
black nationalist."
"I don't recall so," I said.
"You'll hear of him soon enough. Sit 
down, Brother Clifton; sit down.
You must be careful. You are valuable 
to the organization, you must not take
chances."
"This was unavoidable," the young man 
said.
"Just the same," Brother Jack said, 
returning to the discussion with a
call for ideas.
"Brother, are we still to fight against 
evictions?" I said.
"It has become a leading issue, thanks 
to you."
"Then why not step up the fight?"
He studied my face. "What do you 
suggest?"
"Well, since it has attracted so much 
attention, why not try to reach
the whole community with the issue?"
"And how would you suggest we go about 
it?"
"I suggest we get the community leaders 
on record in support of us."
"There are certain difficulties in face 
of this," Brother Jack said.
"Most of the leaders are against us."
"But I think he's got something there," 
Brother Clifton said. "What if
we got them to support the issue 
whether they like us or not? The issue 
is a
community issue, it's non-partisan."
"Sure," I said, "that's how it looks to 
me. With all the excitement
over evictions they can't afford to 
come out against us, not without 
appearing
to be against the best interests of the 
community . . ."
"So we have them across a barrel," 
Clifton said.
"That is perceptive enough," Brother 
Jack said.
The others agreed.
"You see," Brother Jack said with a 
grin, "we've always avoided these
leaders, but the moment we start to 
advance on a broad front, sectarianism
becomes a burden to be cast off. Any 
other suggestions?" He looked around.
"Brother," I said, remembering now, 
"when I first came to Harlem
one of the first things that impressed 
me was a man making a speech from a
ladder. He spoke very violently and 
with an accent, but he had an
enthusiastic audience . . . Why can't 
we carry our program to the street in
the same way?"

"So you have met him," he said, 
suddenly grinning. "Well, Ras the
Exhorter has had a monopoly in Harlem. 
But now that we are larger we
might give it a try. What the committee 
wants is results!"
So that was Ras the Exhorter, I thought.
"We'll have trouble with the Extortor 
-- I mean the Exhorter," a big
woman said. "His hoodlums would attack 
and denounce the white meat of a
roasted chicken."
We laughed.
"He goes wild when he sees black people 
and white people together,"
she said to me.
"We'll take care of that," Brother 
Clifton said, touching his cheek.
"Very well, but no violence," Brother 
Jack said. "The Brotherhood is
against violence and terror and 
provocation of any kind -- aggressive, 
that is.
Understand, Brother Clifton?"
"I understand," he said.
"We will not countenance any aggressive 
violence. Understand? Nor
attacks upon officials or others who do 
not attack us. We are against all
forms of violence, do you understand?"
"Yes, Brother," I said.
"Very well, having made this clear I 
leave you now," he said. "See
what you can accomplish. You'll have 
plenty support from other districts and
all the guidance you need. Meanwhile, 
remember that we are all under
discipline."
He left and we divided the labor. I 
suggested that each work in the
area he knew best. Since there was no 
liaison between the Brotherhood and
the community leaders I assigned myself 
the task of creating one. It was
decided that our street meetings begin 
immediately and that Brother Tod
Clifton was to return and go over the 
details with me.
While the discussion continued I 
studied their faces. They seemed
absorbed with the cause and in complete 
agreement, blacks and whites. But
when I tried to place them as to type I 
got nowhere. The big woman who
looked like a southern "sudsbuster" was 
in charge of women's work, and
spoke in abstract, ideological terms. 
The shy-looking man with the liver
splotches on his neck spoke with a bold 
directness and eagerness for action.
And this Brother Tod Clifton, the youth 
leader, looked somehow like a

hipster, a zoot suiter, a sharpie -- 
except his head of Persian lamb's wool 
had
never known a straightener. I could 
place none of them. They seemed familiar
but were just as different as Brother 
Jack and the other whites were from all
the white men I had known. They were 
all transformed, like familiar people
seen in a dream. Well, I thought, I'm 
different too, and they'll see it when
the talk is finished and the action 
begins. I'll just have to be careful 
not to
antagonize anyone. As it is, someone 
might resent my being placed in charge.
But when Brother Tod Clifton came into 
my office to discuss the
street meeting I saw no signs of 
resentment, but a complete absorption 
in the
strategy of the meeting. With great 
care he went about instructing me how to
deal with hecklers, on what to do if we 
were attacked, and upon how to
recognize our own members from the rest 
of the crowd. For all his seeming
zoot-suiter characteristics his speech 
was precise and I had no doubt that he
knew his business.
"How do you think we'll do?" I said 
when he had finished.
"It'll go big, man," he said. "It'll be 
bigger than anything since
Garvey."
"I wish I could be so sure," I said. "I 
never saw Garvey."
"I didn't either," he said, "but I 
understand that in Harlem he was
very big."
"Well, we're not Garvey, and he didn't 
last."
"No, but he must have had something," 
he said with sudden passion.
"He must have had something to move all 
those people! Our people are hell
to move. He must have had plenty!"
I looked at him. His eyes were turned 
inward; then he smiled. "Don't
worry," he said. "We have a scientific 
plan and you set them off. Things are
so bad they'll listen, and when they 
listen they'll go along."
"I hope so," I said.
"They will. You haven't been around the 
movement as I have, for
three years now, and I can feel the 
change. They're ready to move."
"I hope your feelings are right," I 
said.
"They're right, all right," he said. 
"All we have to do is gather them
in."

THE evening was almost of a winter 
coldness, the corner well lighted
and the all-Negro crowd large and 
tightly packed. Up on the ladder now I
was surrounded by a group of Clifton's 
youth division, and I could see,
beyond their backs with upturned 
collars, the faces of the doubtful, the
curious and the convinced in the crowd. 
It was early and I threw my voice
hard down against the traffic sounds, 
feeling the damp coldness of the air
upon my cheeks and hands as my voice 
warmed with my emotion. I had just
begun to feel the pulsing set up 
between myself and the people, hearing 
them
answering in staccato applause and 
agreement when Tod Clifton caught my
eye, pointing. And over the heads of 
the crowd and down past the dark
storefronts and blinking neon signs I 
saw a bristling band of about twenty
men quick-stepping forward. I looked 
down.
"It's trouble, keep talking," Clifton 
said. "Give the boys the signal."
"My Brothers, the time has come for 
action," I shouted. And now I
saw the youth members and some older 
men move around to the back of the
crowd, and up to meet the advancing 
group. Then something sailed up out of
the dark and landed hard against my 
forehead, and I felt the crowd surge in
close, sending the ladder moving 
backwards, and I was like a man 
tottering
above a crowd on stilts, then dropping 
backwards into the street and clear,
hearing the ladder clatter down. They 
were milling in a panic now, and I saw
Clifton beside me. "It's Ras the 
Exhorter," he yelled. "Can you use your
hands?"
"I can use my fists!" I was annoyed.
"Well, all right then. Here's your 
chance. Come on, let's see you
duke!"
He moved forward and seemed to dive 
into the whirling crowd, and
I beside him, seeing them scatter into 
doorways and pound off in the dark.
"There's Ras, over there," Clifton 
cried. And I heard the sound of
breaking glass and the street went 
dark. Someone had knocked out the light,
and through the dimness I saw Clifton 
heading to where a red neon sign
glowed in a dark window as something 
went past my head. Then a man ran
up with a length of pipe and I saw 
Clifton close with him, ducking down and
working in close and grabbing the man's 
wrist and twisting suddenly like a
soldier executing an about-face so that 
now he faced me, the back of the
man's elbow rigid across his shoulder 
and the man rising on tiptoe and

screaming as Clifton straightened 
smoothly and levered down on the arm.
I heard a dry popping sound and saw the 
man sag, and the pipe
rang upon the walk; then someone caught 
me hard in the stomach and
suddenly I knew that I was fighting 
too. I went to my knees and rolled and
pulled erect, facing him. "Get up, 
Uncle Tom," he said, and I clipped him. 
He
had his hands and I had mine and the 
match was even but he was not so
lucky. He wasn't down and he wasn't 
out, but I caught him two good ones
and he decided to fight elsewhere. When 
he turned I tripped him and moved
away.
The fight was moving back into the dark 
where the street lights had
been knocked out clear to the corner, 
and it was quiet except for the
grunting and straining and the sound of 
footfalls and of blows. It was
confusing in the dark and I couldn't 
tell ours from theirs and moved
cautiously, trying to see. Someone up 
the street in the dark yelled, "Break it
up! Break it up!" and I thought, Cops, 
and looked around for Clifton. The
neon sign glowed mysteriously and there 
was a lot of running and cursing,
and now I saw him working skillfully in 
a store lobby before a red CHECKS
CASHED HERE sign and I hurried over, 
hearing objects sailing past my head
and the crash of glass. Clifton's arms 
were moving in short, accurate jabs
against the head and stomach of Ras the 
Exhorter, punching swiftly and
scientifically, careful not to knock 
him into the window or strike the glass
with his fists, working Ras between 
rights and lefts jabbed so fast that he
rocked like a drunken bull, from side 
to side. And as I came up Ras tried to
bull his way out and I saw Clifton 
drive him back and down into a squat, 
his
hands upon the dark floor of the lobby, 
his heels back against the door like a
runner against starting blocks. And 
now, shooting forward, he caught Clifton
coming in, butting him, and I heard the 
burst of breath and Clifton was on
his back and something flashed in Ras's 
hand and he came forward, a short,
heavy figure as wide as the lobby now 
with the knife, moving deliberately. I
spun, looking for the length of pipe, 
diving for it and crawling on hands and
knees and here, here -- and coming up 
to see Ras reach down, getting one
hand into Clifton's collar, the knife 
in the other, looking down at Clifton 
and
panting, bull-angry. I froze, seeing 
him draw back the knife and stop it in
mid-air; draw back and stop, cursing; 
then draw back and stop again, all very
quickly, beginning to cry now and 
talking rapidly at the same time; and me

easing slowly forward.
"Mahn," Ras blurted, "I ought to kill 
you. Godahm, I ought to kill
you and the world be better off. But 
you black, mahn. Why you be black,
mahn? I swear I ought to kill you. No 
mahn strike the Exhorter, godahmit,
no mahn!"
I saw him raise the knife again and now 
as he lowered it unused he
pushed Clifton into the street and 
stood over him, sobbing.
"Why you with these white folks? Why? I 
been watching you a long
time. I say to myself, 'Soon he get 
smart and get tired. He get out of that
t'ing.' Why a good boy like you still 
with them?"
Still moving forward, I saw his face 
gleam with red angry tears as he
stood above Clifton with the still 
innocent knife and the tears red in the 
glow
of the window sign.
"You my brother, mahn. Brothers are the 
same color; how the hell
you call these white men brother? Shit, 
mahn. That's shit! Brothers the same
color. We sons of Mama Africa, you done 
forgot? You black, BLACK! You -Godahm, 
mahn!" he said, swinging the knife for 
emphasis. "You got bahd
hair! You got thick lips! They say you 
stink! They hate you, mahn. You
Afrian. AFRICAN! Why you with them? 
Leave that shit, mahn. They sell you
out. That shit is old-fashioned. They 
enslave us -- you forget that? How can
they mean a black mahn any good? How 
they going to be your brother?"
I had reached him now and brought the 
pipe down hard, seeing the
knife fly off into the' dark as he 
grabbed his wrist, and I raised the pipe
again, suddenly hot with fear and hate, 
as he looked at me out of his narrow
little eyes, standing his ground.
"And you, mahn," the Exhorter said, "a 
reg'lar little black devil! A
godahm sly mongoose! Where you think 
you from, going with the white folks?
I know, godahm; don't I know it! You 
from down South! You from Trinidad!
You from Barbados! Jamaica, South 
Africa, and the white mahn's foot in 
your
ass all the way to the hip. What you 
trying to deny by betraying the black
people? Why you fight against us? You 
young fellows. You young black men
with plenty education; I been hearing 
your rabble rousing. Why you go over
to the enslaver? What kind of education 
is that? What kind of black mahn is
that who betray his own mama?"
"Shut up," Clifton said, leaping to his 
feet. "Shut up!"

"Hell, no," Ras cried, wiping his eyes 
with his fists. "I talk! Bust me
with the pipe but, by God, you listen 
to the Exhorter! Come in with us,
mahn. We build a glorious movement of 
black people. Black People! What
they do, give you money? Who wahnt the 
dahm stuff? Their money bleed
black blood, mahn. It's unclean! Taking 
their money is shit, mahn. Money
without dignity -- That's bahd shit!"
Clifton lunged toward him. I held him, 
shaking my head. "Come on,
the man's crazy," I said, pulling on 
his arm.
Ras struck his thighs with his fists. 
"Me crazy, mahn? You call me
crazy? Look at you two and look at me 
-- is this sanity? Standing here in
three shades of blackness! Three black 
men fighting in the street because of
the

white

enslaver?

Is

that

sanity?

Is

that

consciousness,

scientific

understahnding? Is that the modern 
black mahn of the twentieth century?
Hell, mahn! Is it self-respect -- black 
against black? What they give you to
betray -- their women? You fall for 
that?"
"Let's go," I said, listening and 
remembering and suddenly alive in
the dark with the horror of the battle 
royal, but Clifton looked at Ras with a
tight, fascinated expression, pulling 
away from me.
"Let's go," I repeated. He stood there, 
looking.
"Sure, you go," Ras said, "but not him. 
You contahminated but he
the real black mahn. In Africa this 
mahn be a chief, a black king! Here they
say he rape them godahm women with no 
blood in their veins. I bet this
mahn can't beat them off with baseball 
bat -- shit! What kind of foolishness
is it? Kick him ass from cradle to 
grave then call him brother? Does it 
make
mahthematics? Is it logic? Look at him, 
mahn; open your eyes," he said to
me. "I look like that I rock the 
blahsted world! They know about me in
Japan, India -- all the colored 
countries. Youth! Intelligence! The 
mahn's a
natural prince! Where is your eyes? 
Where your self-respect? Working for
them dahm people? Their days is 
numbered, the time is almost here and 
you
fooling 'round like this was the 
nineteenth century. I don't understahnd 
you.
Am I ignorant? Answer me, mahn!"
"Yes," Clifton burst out. "Hell, yes!"
"You t'ink I'm crazy, is it c'ase I 
speak bahd English? Hell, it ain't
my mama tongue, mahn, I'm African! You 
really t'ink I'm crazy?"
"Yes, yes!"

"You believe that?" said Ras. "What 
they do to you, black mahn?
Give you them stinking women?"
Clifton lunged again, and again I 
grabbed him; and again Ras held
his ground, his head glowing red.
"Women? Godahm, mahn! Is that equality? 
Is that the black mahn's
freedom? A pat on the back and a piece 
of cunt without no passion?
Maggots! They buy you that blahsted 
cheap, mahn? What they do to my
people! Where is your brains? These 
women dregs, mahn! They bilge water!
You know the high-class white mahn 
hates the black mahn, that's simple. So
now he use the dregs and wahnt you 
black young men to do his dirty work.
They betray you and you betray the 
black people. They tricking you, mahn.
Let them fight among themselves. Let 
'em kill off one another. We organize 
-organization is good -- but we 
organize black. BLACK! To hell with 
that son
of a bitch! He take one them strumpets 
and tell the black mahn his freedom
lie between her skinny legs -- while 
that son of a gun, he take all the power
and the capital and don't leave the 
black mahn not'ing. The good white
women he tell the black mahn is a 
rapist and keep them locked up and
ignorant while he makes the black mahn 
a race of bahstards.
"When the black mahn going to tire of 
this childish perfidity? He got
you so you don't trust your black 
intelligence? You young, don't play 
you'self
cheap, mahn. Don't deny you'self! It 
took a billion gallons of black blood to
make you. Recognize you'self inside and 
you wan the kings among men! A
mahn knows he's a mahn when he got 
not'ing, when he's naked -- nobody
have to tell him that. You six foot 
tall, mahn. You young and intelligent. 
You
black and beautiful -- don't let 'em 
tell you different! You wasn't them 
t'ings
you be dead, mahn. Dead! I'd have 
killed you, mahn. Ras the Exhorter 
raised
up his knife and tried to do it, but he 
could not do it. Why don't you do it?
I ask myself. I will do it now, I say; 
but somet'ing tell me, 'No, no! You
might be killing your black king!' And 
I say, yas, yas! So I accept your
humiliating ahction. Ras recognized 
your black possibilities, mahn. Ras 
would
not sahcrifice his black brother to the 
white enslaver. Instead he cry. Ras is a
mahn -- no white mahn have to tell him 
that -- and Ras cry. So why don't
you recognize your black duty, mahn, 
and come jine us?"
His chest was heaving and a note of 
pleading had come into the
harsh voice. He was an exhorter, all 
right, and I was caught in the crude,

insane eloquence of his plea. He stood 
there, awaiting an answer. And
suddenly a big transport plane came low 
over the buildings and I looked up
to see the firing of its engine, and we 
were all three silent, watching.
Suddenly the Exhorter shook his fist 
toward the plane and yelled,
"Hell with him, some day we have them 
too! Hell with him!"
He stood there, shaking his fist as the 
plane rattled the buildings in
its powerful flight. Then it was gone 
and I looked about the unreal street.
They were fighting far up the block in 
the dark now and we were alone. I
looked at the Exhorter. I didn't know 
if I was angry or amazed.
"Look," I said, shaking my head, "let's 
talk sense. From now on we'll
be on the street corners every night 
and we'll be prepared for trouble. We
don't want it, especially with you, but 
we won't run either . . ."
"Goddam, mahn," he said, leaping 
forward, "this is Harlem. This is
my territory, the black mahn's 
territory. You think we let white folks 
come in
and spread their poison? Let 'em come 
in like they come and take over the
numbers racket? Like they have all the 
stores? Talk sense, mahn, if you
talking to Ras, talk sense!"
"This is sense," I said, "and you 
listen as we listened to you. We'll
be out here every night, understand. 
We'll be out here and the next time you
go after one of our brothers with a 
knife -- and I mean white or black 
-well, we won't forget it."
He shook his head, "Nor will I forget 
you either, mahn."
"Don't. I don't want you to; because if 
you forget there'll be trouble.
You're mistaken, don't you see you're 
outnumbered? You need allies to win . .
."
"That there is sense. Black allies. 
Yellow and brown allies!"
"All men who want a brotherly world," I 
said.
"Don't be stupid, mahn. They white, 
they don't have to be allies with
no black people. They get what they 
wahnt, they turn against you. Where's
your black intelligence?"
"Thinking like that will get you lost 
in the backwash of history," I
said. "Start thinking with your mind 
and not your emotions."
He shook his head vehemently, looking 
at Clifton.
"This black mahn talking to me about 
brains and thinking. I ask
both of you, are you awake or sleeping? 
What is your pahst and where are

you going? Never mind, take your 
corrupt ideology and eat out your own 
guts
like a laughing hyena. You are nowhere, 
mahn. Nowhere! Ras is not ignorant,
nor is Ras afraid. No! Ras, he be here 
black and fighting for the liberty of
the black people when the white folks 
have got what they wahnt and done
gone off laughing in your face and you 
stinking and choked up with white
maggots."
He spat angrily into the dark street. 
It flew pink in the red glow.
"That'll be all right with me," I said. 
"Only remember what I said.
Come on, Brother Clifton. This man's 
full of pus, black pus."
We started away, a piece of glass 
crunching under my foot.
"Maybe so," Ras said, "but I ahm no 
fool! I ahm no black educated
fool who t'inks everything between 
black mahn and white mahn can be
settled with some blahsted lies in some 
bloody books written by the white
mahn in the first place. It's three 
hundred years of black blood to build 
this
white mahn's civilization and wahn't be 
wiped out in a minute. Blood calls
for blood! You remember that. And 
remember that I am not like you. Ras
recognizes the true issues and he is 
not afraid to be black. Nor is he a
traitor for white men. Remember that: I 
am no black traitor to the black
people for the white people."
And before I could answer Clifton spun 
in the dark and there was a
crack and I saw Ras go down and Clifton 
breathing hard and Ras lying there
in the street, a thick, black man with 
red tears on his face that caught the
reflection of the CHECKS CASHED HERE 
sign.
And again, as Clifton looked gravely 
down he seemed to ask a silent
question.
"Let's go," I said. "Let's go!"
We started away as the screams of 
sirens sounded, Clifton cursing
quietly to himself.
Then we were out of the dark onto a 
busy street and he turned to
me. There were tears in his eyes.
"That poor, misguided son of a bitch," 
he said.
"He thinks a lot of you, too," I said. 
I was glad to be out of the
dark and away from that exhorting voice.
"The man's crazy," Clifton said. "It'll 
run you crazy if you let it."
"Where'd he get that name?" I said.

"He gave it to himself. I guess he did. 
Ras is a title of respect in the
East. It's a wonder he didn't say 
something about 'Ethiopia stretching 
forth
her wings,' " he said, mimicking Ras. 
"He makes it sound like the hood of a
cobra fluttering . . . I don't know . . 
. I don't know . . ."
"We'll have to watch him now," I said.
"Yes, we'd better," he said. "He won't 
stop fighting . . . And thanks
for getting rid of his knife."
"You didn't have to worry," I said. "He 
wouldn't kill his king."
He turned and looked at me as though he 
thought I might mean it;
then he smiled.
"For a while there I thought I was 
gone," he said.
As we headed for the district office I 
wondered what Brother Jack
would say about the fight.
"We'll have to overpower him with 
organization," I said.
"We'll do that, all right. But it's on 
the inside that Ras is strong,"
Clifton said. "On the inside he's 
dangerous."
"He won't get on the inside," I said. 
"He'd consider himself a traitor."
"No," Clifton said, "he won't get on 
the inside. Did you hear how he
was talking? Did you hear what he was 
saying?"
"I heard him, sure," I said.
"I don't know," he said. "I suppose 
sometimes a man has to plunge
outside history . . ."
"What?"
"Plunge outside, turn his back . . . 
Otherwise he might kill
somebody, go nuts."
I didn't answer. Maybe he's right, I 
thought, and was suddenly very
glad I had found Brotherhood.

THE next morning it rained and I 
reached the district before the
others arrived and stood looking 
through the window of my office, past 
the
jutting wall of a building, and on 
beyond the monotonous pattern of its
bricks and mortar I saw a row of trees 
rising tall and graceful in the rain.
One tree grew close by and I could see 
the rain streaking its bark and its
sticky buds. Trees were rowed the 
length of the long block beyond me, 
rising

tall in dripping wetness above a series 
of cluttered backyards. And it occurred
to me that cleared of its ramshackle 
fences and planted with flowers and
grass, it might form a pleasant park. 
And just then a paper bag sailed from a
window to my left and burst like a 
silent grenade, scattering garbage into 
the
trees and pancaking to earth with a 
soggy, exhausted plop! I started with
disgust, then thought, The sun will 
shine in those backyards some day. A
community clean-up campaign might be 
worthwhile for a slack season, at
that. Everything couldn't possibly be 
as exciting as last night.
Turning back to my desk I sat facing 
the map now as Brother Tarp
appeared.
"Morning, son, I see you already on the 
job," he said.
"Good morning. I have so much to do 
that I thought I'd better get
started early," I said.
"You'll do all right," he said. "But I 
didn't come in here to take up
your time, I want to put something on 
the wall."
"Go right ahead. Can I give you a hand?"
"No, I can make it all right," he said, 
clambering with his lame leg
upon a chair that sat beneath the map 
and hanging a frame from the ceiling
molding, straightening it carefully, 
and getting down to come over beside my
desk.
"Son, you know who that is?"
"Why, yes," I said, "it's Frederick 
Douglass."
"Yessir, that's just who it is. You 
know much about him?"
"Not much. My grandfather used to tell 
me about him though."
"That's enough. He was a great man. You 
just take a look at him
once in a while. You have everything 
you need -- paper and stuff like that?"
"Yes, I have, Brother Tarp. And thanks 
for the portrait of Douglass."
"Don't thank me, son," he said from the 
door. "He belongs to all of
us."
I sat now facing the portrait of 
Frederick Douglass, feeling a sudden
piety, remembering and refusing to hear 
the echoes of my grandfather's voice.
Then I picked up the telephone and 
began calling the community leaders.
They

fell

in

line

like

prisoners:

preachers,

politicians,

various

professionals, proving Clifton correct. 
The eviction fight was such a dramatic
issue that most of the leaders feared 
that their followers would have rallied 
to

us without them. I slighted no one, no 
matter how unimportant; bigshots,
doctors, real-estate men and 
store-front preachers. And it went so 
fast and
smoothly that it seemed not to happen 
to me but to someone who actually
bore my new name. I almost laughed into 
the phone when I heard the
director of Men's House address me with 
profound respect. My new name
was getting around. It's very strange, 
I thought, but things are so unreal for
them normally that they believe that to 
call a thing by name is to make it
so. And yet I am what they think I am . 
. .

OUR work went so well that a few 
Sundays later we threw a parade
that clinched our hold on the 
community. We worked feverishly. And 
now the
clashing and conflict of my last days 
at Mary's seemed to have moved out
into the struggles of the community, 
leaving me inwardly calm and controlled.
Even the hustle and bustle of picketing 
and speechmaking seemed to
stimulate me for the better; my wildest 
ideas paid off.
Upon hearing that one of the unemployed 
brothers was an ex-drill
master from Wichita, Kansas, I 
organized a drill team of six-footers 
whose
duty it was to march through the 
streets striking up sparks with their
hobnailed shoes. On the day of the 
parade they drew crowds faster than a
dogfight on a country road. The 
People's Hot Foot Squad, we called them,
and when they drilled fancy formations 
down Seventh Avenue in the
springtime dusk they set the streets 
ablaze. The community laughed and
cheered and the police were dumfounded. 
But the sheer corn of it got them
and the Hot Foot Squad went shuffling 
along. Then came the flags and
banners and the cards bearing slogans; 
and the squad of drum majorettes, the
best-looking girls we could find, who 
pranced and twirled and just plain
girled in the enthusiastic interest of 
Brotherhood. We pulled fifteen thousand
Harlemites into the street behind our 
slogans and marched down Broadway to
City Hall. Indeed, we were the talk of 
the town.
With this success I was pushed forward 
at a dizzy pace. My name
spread like smoke in an airless room. I 
was kept moving all over the place.
Speeches here, there, everywhere, 
uptown and down. I wrote newspaper
articles, led parades and relief 
delegations, and so on. And the 
Brotherhood
was going out of its way to make my 
name prominent. Articles, telegrams

and many mailings went out over my 
signature -- some of which I'd written,
but most not. I was publicized, 
identified with the organization both 
by word
and image in the press. On the way to 
work one late spring morning I
counted fifty greetings from people I 
didn't know, becoming aware that there
were two of me: the old self that slept 
a few hours a night and dreamed
sometimes of my grandfather and Bledsoe 
and Brockway and Mary, the self
that flew without wings and plunged 
from great heights; and the new public
self that spoke for the Brotherhood and 
was becoming so much more
important than the other that I seemed 
to run a foot race against myself.
Still, I liked my work during those 
days of certainty. I kept my eyes
wide and ears alert. The Brotherhood 
was a world within a world and I was
determined to discover all its secrets 
and to advance as far as I could. I saw
no limits, it was the one organization 
in the whole country in which I could
reach the very top and I meant to get 
there. Even if it meant climbing a
mountain of words. For now I had begun 
to believe, despite all the talk of
science around me, that there was a 
magic in spoken words. Sometimes I sat
watching the watery play of light upon 
Douglass' portrait, thinking how
magical it was that he had talked his 
way from slavery to a government
ministry, and so swiftly. Perhaps, I 
thought, something of the kind is
happening to me. Douglass came north to 
escape and find work in the
shipyards; a big fellow in a sailor's 
suit who, like me, had taken another
name. What had his true name been? 
Whatever it was, it was as Douglass
that he became himself, defined 
himself. And not as a boatwright as he'd
expected, but as an orator. Perhaps the 
sense of magic lay in the unexpected
transformations. "You start Saul, and 
end up Paul," my grandfather had often
said. "When you're a youngun, you Saul, 
but let life whup your head a bit
and you starts to trying to be Paul -- 
though you still Sauls around on the
side."
No, you could never tell where you were 
going, that was a sure
thing. The only sure thing. Nor could 
you tell how you'd get there -- though
when you arrived it was somehow right. 
For hadn't I started out with a
speech, and hadn't it been a speech 
that won my scholarship to college,
where I had expected speechmaking to 
win me a place with Bledsoe and
launch me finally as a national leader? 
Well, I had made a speech, and it
had made me a leader, only not the kind 
I had expected. So that was the

way it was. And no complaints, I 
thought, looking at the map; you started
looking for red men and you found them 
-- even though of a different tribe
and in a bright new world. The world 
was strange if you stopped to think
about it; still it was a world that 
could be controlled by science, and the
Brotherhood had both science and 
history under control.
Thus for one lone stretch of time I 
lived with the intensity displayed
by those chronic numbers players who 
see clues to their fortune in the most
minute and insignificant phenomena: in 
clouds, on passing trucks and subway
cars, in dreams, comic strips, the 
shape of dog-luck fouled on the 
pavements.
I was dominated by the all-embracing 
idea of Brotherhood. The organization
had given the world a new shape, and me 
a vital role. We recognized no
loose ends, everything could be 
controlled by our science. Life was all 
pattern
and discipline; and the beauty of 
discipline is when it works. And it was
working very well.

Chapter 18
Only my Bledsoe-trustee inspired 
compulsion to read all papers that
touched my hands prevented me from 
throwing the envelope aside. It was
unstamped and appeared to be the least 
important item in the morning's
mail:
Brother,
This is advice from a friend who has 
been watching you closely. Do
not go too fast. Keep working for the 
people but remember that you are one
of us and do not forget if you get too 
big they will cut you down. You are
from the South and you know that this 
is a white man's world. So take a
friendly advice and go easy so that you 
can keep on helping the colored
people. They do not want you to go too 
fast and will cut you down if you
do. Be smart . . .

I shot to my feet, the paper rattling 
poisonously in my hands. What
did it mean? Who'd send such a thing?
"Brother Tarp!" I called, reading again 
the wavery lines of a
handwriting that was somehow familiar. 
"Brother Tarp!"
"What is it, son?"
And looking up, I received another 
shock. Framed there in the gray,
early morning light of the door, my 
grandfather seemed to look from his
eyes. I gave a quick gasp, then there 
was a silence in which I could hear his
wheezing breath as he eyed me 
unperturbed.
"What's wrong?" he said, limping into 
the room.
I reached for the envelope. "Where did 
this come from?" I said.
"What is it?" he said, taking it calmly 
from my hands.
"It's unstamped."
"Oh, yes -- I saw it myself," he said. 
"I reckon somebody put it in
the box late last night. I took it out 
with the regular mail. Is it something
that wasn't for you?"
"No," I said, avoiding his eyes. "But 
-- it isn't dated. I was wondering
when it arrived -- Why are you staring 
at me?"
"Because looks to me like you seen a 
ghost. You feel sick?"
"It's nothing," I said. "Just a slight 
upset."
There was an awkward silence. He stood 
there and I forced myself to
look at his eyes again, finding my 
grandfather gone, leaving only the
searching calm. I said, "Sit down a 
second, Brother Tarp. Since you're here
I'd like to ask you a question."
"Sure," he said, dropping into a chair. 
"Go 'head."
"Brother Tarp, you get around and know 
the members -- how do
they really feel about me?"
He cocked his head. "Why, sure -- they 
think you're going to make a
real leader --"
"But?"
"Ain't no buts, that's what they think 
and I don't mind telling you."
"But what about the others?"
"What others?"
"The ones who don't think so much of 
me?"
"Them's the ones I haven't heard about, 
son."

"But I must have some enemies," I said.
"Sure, I guess everybody has 'em, but I 
never heard of anybody here
in the Brotherhood not liking you. As 
far as folks up here is concerned they
think you're it. You heard any 
different?"
"No, but I was wondering. I've been 
going along taking them so
much for granted that I thought I'd 
better check so that I can keep their
support."
"Well, you don't have to worry. So far, 
nearly everything you had
anything to do with has turned out to 
be what the folks like, even things
some of 'em resisted. Take that there," 
he said, pointing to the wall near my
desk.
It was a symbolic poster of a group of 
heroic figures: An American
Indian couple, representing the 
dispossessed past; a blond brother (in
overalls) and a leading Irish sister, 
representing the dispossessed present; 
and
Brother Tod Clifton and a young white 
couple (it had been felt unwise simply
to show Clifton and the girl) 
surrounded by a group of children of 
mixed
races, representing the future, a color 
photograph of bright skin texture and
smooth contrast.
"So?" I said, staring at the legend:
"After the Struggle: The Rainbow of 
America's Future"
"Well, when you first suggested it, 
some of the members was against
you."
"That's certainly true."
"Sho, and they raised the devil about 
the youth members going into
the subways and sticking 'em up in 
place of them constipation ads and 
things
-- but do you know what they doing now?"
"I guess they're holding it against me 
because some of the kids were
arrested," I said.
"Holding it against you? Hell, they 
going around bragging about it.
But what I was about to say is they 
taking them rainbow pictures and
tacking 'em to their walls 'long with 
'God Bless Our Home' and the Lord's
Prayer. They're crazy about it. And 
same way with the Hot-Footers and all
that. You don't have to worry, son. 
They might resist some of your ideas, 
but

when the deal goes down, they with you 
right on down to the ground. The
only enemies you likely to have is 
somebody on the outside who's jealous to
see you spring up all of a sudden and 
start to doing some of the things what
should of been done years ago. And what 
do you care when some folks start
knocking you? It's a sign you getting 
some place."
"I'd like to believe so, Brother Tarp," 
I said. "As long as I have the
people with me I'll believe in what I'm 
doing."
"That's right," he said. "When things 
get rough it kind of helps to
know you got support --" His voice 
broke off and he seemed to stare down
at me, although he faced me at eye 
level acrosis the desk.
"What is it, Brother Tarp?"
"You from down South, ain't you, son?"
"Yes," I said.
He turned in his chair, sliding one 
hand into his pocket as he rested
his chin upon the other. "I don't 
really have the words to say what just 
come
into my head, son. You see, I was down 
there for a long time before I come
up here, and when I did come up they 
was after me. What I mean is, I had
to escape, I had to come a-running."
"I guess I did too, in a way," I said.
"You mean they were after you too?"
"Not really, Brother Tarp, I just feel 
that way."
"Well this ain't exactly the same 
thing," he said. "You notice this
limp I got?"
"Yes."
"Well, I wasn't always lame, and I'm 
not really now 'cause the
doctors can't find anything wrong with 
that leg. They say it's sound as a
piece of steel. What I mean is I got 
this limp from dragging a chain."
I couldn't see it in his face or hear 
it in his speech, yet I knew he
was neither lying nor trying to shock 
me. I shook my head.
"Sure," he said. "Nobody knows that 
about me, they just think I got
rheumatism. But it was that chain and 
after nineteen years I haven't been
able to stop dragging my leg."
"Nineteen years!"
"Nineteen years, six months and two 
days. And what I did wasn't
much; that is, it wasn't much when I 
did it. But after all that time it

changed into something else and it 
seemed to be as bad as they said it was.
All that time made it bad. I paid for 
it with everything I had but my life. I
lost my wife and my boys and my piece 
of land. So what started out as an
argument between a couple of men turned 
out to be a crime worth nineteen
years of my life."
"What on earth did you do, Brother 
Tarp?"
"I said no to a man who wanted to take 
something from me; that's
what it cost me for saying no and even 
now the debt ain't fully paid and will
never be paid in their terms."
A pain throbbed in my throat and I felt 
a kind of numb despair.
Nineteen years! And here he was talking 
quietly to me and this no doubt the
first time he'd tried to tell anyone 
about it. But why me, I thought, why 
pick
me?
"I said no," he said. "I said hell, no! 
And I kept saying no until I
broke the chain and left."
"But how?"
"They let me get close to the dogs once 
in a while, that's how. I
made friends with them dogs and I 
waited. Down there you really learn how
to wait. I waited nineteen years and 
then one morning when the river was
flooding I left. They thought I was one 
of them who got drowned when the
levee broke, but I done broke the chain 
and gone. I was standing in the mud
holding a long-handled shovel and I 
asked myself, Tarp, can you make it?
And inside me I said yes; all that 
water and mud and rain said yes, and I
took off."
Suddenly he gave a laugh so gay it 
startled me.
"I'm tellin' it better'n I ever thought 
I could," he said, fishing in his
pocket and removing something that 
looked like an oilskin tobacco pouch,
from which he removed an object wrapped 
in a handkerchief.
"I've been looking for freedom ever 
since, son. And sometimes I've
done all right. Up to these here hard 
times I did very well, considering that
I'm a man whose health is not too good. 
But even when times were best for
me I remembered. Because I didn't want 
to forget those nineteen years I just
kind of held on to this as a keepsake 
and a reminder."
He was unwrapping the object now and I 
watched his old man's
hands.

"I'd like to pass it on to you, son. 
There," he said, handing it to me.
"Funny thing to give somebody, but I 
think it's got a heap of signifying
wrapped up in it and it might help you 
remember what we're really fighting
against. I don't think of it in terms 
of but two words, yes and no; but it
signifies a heap more . . ."
I saw him place his hand on the desk. 
"Brother," he said, calling me
"Brother" for the first time, "I want 
you to take it. I guess it's a kind of 
luck
piece. Anyway, it's the one I filed to 
get away."
I took it in my hand, a thick, dark, 
oily piece of filed steel that had
been twisted open and forced partly 
back into place, on which I saw marks
that might have been made by the blade 
of a hatchet. It was such a link as I
had seen on Bledsoe's desk, only while 
that one had been smooth, Tarp's
bore the marks of haste and violence, 
looking as though it had been attacked
and conquered before it stubbornly 
yielded.
I looked at him and shook my head as he 
watched me inscrutably.
Finding no words to ask him more about 
it, I slipped the link over my
knuckles and struck it sharply against 
the desk.
Brother Tarp chuckled. "Now there's a 
way I never thought of using
it," he said. "It's pretty good. It's 
pretty good."
"But why do you give it to me, Brother 
Tarp?"
"Because I have to, I guess. Now don't 
go trying to get me to say
what I can't. You're the talker, not 
me," he said, getting up and limping
toward the door. "It was lucky to me 
and I think it might be lucky to you.
You just keep it with you and look at 
it once in a while. Course, if you get
tired of it, why, give it back."
"Oh, no," I called after him, "I want 
it and I think I understand.
Thanks for giving it to me."
I looked at the dark band of metal 
against my fist and dropped it
upon the anonymous letter. I neither 
wanted it nor knew what to do with it;
although there was no question of 
keeping it if for no other reason than 
that
I felt that Brother Tarp's gesture in 
offering it was of some deeply felt
significance which I was compelled to 
respect. Something, perhaps, like a man
passing on to his son his own father's 
watch, which the son accepted not
because he wanted the old-fashioned 
time-piece for itself, but because of 
the
overtones of unstated seriousness and 
solemnity of the paternal gesture which

at once joined him with his ancestors, 
marked a high point of his present,
and promised a concreteness to his 
nebulous and chaotic future. And now I
remembered that if I had returned home 
instead of coming north my father
would have given me my grandfather's 
old-fashioned Hamilton, with its long,
burr-headed winding stem. Well, so my 
brother would get it and I'd never
wanted it anyway. What were they doing 
now, I brooded, suddenly sick for
home.
I could feel the air from the window 
hot against my neck now as
through the smell of morning coffee I 
heard a throaty voice singing with a
mixture of laughter and solemnity:
Don't come early in the morning
Neither in the heat of the day
But come in the sweet cool of the
Evening and wash my sins away . . .
A whole series of memories started to 
well up, but I threw them off. There
was no time for memory, for all its 
images were of times passed.
There had been only a few minutes from 
the time that I'd called in
Brother Tarp about the letter and his 
leaving, but it seemed as though I'd
plunged down a well of years. I looked 
calmly now at the writing which, for
a moment, had shaken my total structure 
of certainty, and was glad that
Brother Tarp had been there to be 
called rather than Clifton or some of 
the
others before whom I would have been 
ashamed of my panic. Instead he'd
left me soberly confident. Perhaps from 
the shock of seeming to see my
grandfather looking through Tarp's 
eyes, perhaps through the calmness of 
his
voice alone, or perhaps through his 
story and his link of chain, he had
restored my perspective.
He's right, I thought; whoever sent the 
message is trying to confuse
me; some enemy is trying to halt our 
progress by destroying my faith through
touching upon my old southern distrust, 
our fear of white betrayal. It was as
though he had learned of my experience 
with Bledsoe's letters and was trying
to use that knowledge to destroy not 
only me but the whole Brotherhood. Yet
that was impossible; no one knew that 
story who knew me now. It was
simply an obscene coincidence. If only 
I could get my hands upon his stupid

throat. Here in the Brotherhood was the 
one place in the country where we
were free and given the greatest 
encouragement to use our abilities, and 
he
was trying to destroy it! No, it wasn't 
me he was worrying about becoming
too big, it was the Brotherhood. And 
becoming big was exactly what the
Brotherhood wanted. Hadn't I just 
received orders to submit ideas for
organizing more people? And "a white 
man's world" was just what the
Brotherhood

was

against.

We

were

dedicated

to

building

a

world

of

Brotherhood.
But who had sent it -- Ras the 
Exhorter? No, it wasn't like him. He
was more direct and absolutely against 
any collaboration between blacks and
whites. It was someone else, someone 
more insidious than Ras. But who, I
wondered, forcing it below my 
consciousness as I turned to the tasks 
at hand.
The morning began with people asking my 
advice on how to secure
relief; members coming in for 
instructions for small committee 
meetings being
held in corners of the large hall; and 
I had just dismissed a woman seeking
to free her husband, who had been 
jailed for beating her, when Brother
Wrestrum entered the room. I returned 
his greeting and watched him ease
into a chair, his eyes sweeping over my 
desk-with uneasiness. He seemed to
possess some kind of authority in the 
Brotherhood, but his exact function was
unclear. He was, I felt, something of a 
meddler.
And hardly had he settled himself when 
he stared at my desk,
saying, "What you got there, Brother?" 
and pointed toward a pile of my
papers.
I leaned slowly back in my chair, 
looking him in the eye. "That's my
work," I said coldly, determined to 
stop any interference from the start.
"But I mean that," he said, pointing, 
his eyes beginning to blaze,
"that there."
"It's work," I said, "all my work."
"Is that too?" he said, pointing to 
Brother Tarp's leg link.
"That's just a personal present, 
Brother," I said. "What could I do for
you?"
"That ain't what I asked you, Brother. 
What is it?"
I picked up the link and held it toward 
him, the metal oily and
strangely skinlike now with the 
slanting sun entering the window. 
"Would you
care to examine it, Brother? One of our 
members wore it nineteen years on

the chain gang."
"Hell, no!" He recoiled. "I mean, no, 
thank you. In fact, Brother, I
don't think we ought to have such 
things around!"
"You think so," I said. "And just why?"
"Because I don't think we ought to 
dramatize our differences."
"I'm not dramatizing anything, it's my 
personal property that happens
to be lying on my desk."
"But people can see it!"
"That's true," I said. "But I think 
it's a good reminder of what our
movement is fighting against."
"No, suh!" he said, shaking his head, 
"no, suh! That's the worse kind
of thing for Brotherhood -- because we 
want to make folks think of the
things we have in common. That's what 
makes for Brotherhood. We have to
change this way we have of always 
talking about how different we are. In 
the
Brotherhood we are all brothers."
I was amused. He was obviously 
disturbed by something deeper than
a need to forget differences. Fear was 
in his eyes. "I never thought of it in
just that way, Brother," I said, 
dangling the iron between my finger and
thumb.
"But you want to think about it," he 
said. "We have to discipline
ourselves. Things that don't make for 
Brotherhood have to be rooted out. We
have enemies, you know. I watch 
everything I do and say so as to be sure
that I don't upset the Brotherhood -- 
'cause this is a wonderful movement,
Brother, and we have to keep it that 
way. We have to watch ourselves,
Brother. You know what I mean? Too 
often we're liable to forget that this 
is
something that's a privilege to belong 
to. We're liable to say things that 
don't
do nothing but make for more 
misunderstanding."
What's driving him, I thought, what's 
all this to do with me? Could
he have sent me the note? Dropping the 
iron I fished the anonymous note
from beneath the pile and held it by a 
corner, so that the slanting sun shone
through the page and outlined the 
scrawling letters. I watched him 
intently.
He was leaning upon the desk now, 
looking at the page but with no
recognition

in

his

eyes.

I

dropped

the

page

upon

the

chain,

more

disappointed than relieved.
"Between you and me, Brother," he said, 
"there are those amongst us

who don't really believe in 
Brotherhood."
"Oh?"
"You damn right they don't! They're 
just in it to use it for their own
ends. Some call you Brother to your 
face and the minute you turn your back,
you're a black son of a bitch! You got 
to watch 'em."
"I haven't encountered any of that, 
Brother," I said.
"You will. There's lots of poison 
around. Some don't want to shake
your hand and some don't like the idea 
of seeing too much of you; but
goddam it, in the Brotherhood they 
gotta!"
I looked at him. It had never occurred 
to me that the Brotherhood
could force anyone to shake my hand, 
and that he found satisfaction that it
could was both shocking and distasteful.
Suddenly he laughed. "Yes, dammit, they 
gotta! Me, I don't let 'em
get away with nothing. If they going to 
be brothers let 'em be brothers! Oh,
but I'm fair," he said, his face 
suddenly self-righteous. "I'm fair. I 
ask myself
every day, 'What are you doing against 
Brotherhood?' and when I find it, I
root it out, I burn it out like a man 
cauterizing a mad-dog bite. This
business of being a brother is a 
full-time job. You have to be pure in 
heart,
and you have to be disciplined in body 
and mind. Brother, you understand
what I mean?"
"Yes, I think I do," I said. "Some 
folks feel that way about their
religion."
"Religion?" He blinked his eyes. "Folks 
like me and you is full of
distrust," he said. "We been corrupted 
'til it's hard for some of us to believe
in Brotherhood. And some even want 
revenge! That's what I'm talking about.
We have to root it out! We have to 
learn to trust our other brothers. After
all, didn't they start the Brotherhood? 
Didn't they come and stretch out their
hand to us black men and say, 'We want 
y'all for our brothers?' Didn't they
do it? Didn't they, now? Didn't they 
set out to organize us, and help fight
our battle and all like that? Sho they 
did, and we have to remember it
twenty-four hours a day. Brotherhood. 
That's the word we got to keep right
in front of our eyes every second. Now 
this brings me to why I come to see
you, Brother."
He sat back, his huge hands grasping 
his knees. "I got a plan I want
to talk over with you."

"What is it, Brother?" I said.
"Well, it's like this. I think we ought 
to have some way of showing
what we are. We ought to have some 
banners and things like that. Specially
for us black brothers."
"I see," I said, becoming interested. 
"But why do you think this is
important?"
" 'Cause it helps the Brotherhood, 
that's why. First, if you remember,
when you watch our people when there's 
a parade or a funeral, or a dance or
anything like that, they always have 
some kind of flags and banners even if
they don't mean anything. It kind of 
makes the occasion seem more
important like. It makes people stop 
look and listen. 'What's coming off 
here?'
But you know and I know that they ain't 
none of 'em got no true flag -except 
maybe Ras the Exhorter, and he claims 
he's Ethiopian or African. But
none of us got no true flag 'cause that 
flag don't really belong to us. They
want a true flag, one that's as much 
theirs as anybody else's. You know what
I mean?"
"Yes, I think I do," I said, 
remembering that there was always that
sense in me of being apart when the 
flag went by. It had been a reminder,
until I'd found the Brotherhood, that 
my star was not yet there . . .
"Sure, you know," Brother Wrestrum 
said. "Everybody wants a flag.
We need a flag that stands for 
Brotherhood, and we need a sign we can
wear."
"A sign?"
"You know, a pin or a button."
"You mean an emblem?"
"That's it! Something we can wear, a 
pin or something like that. So
that when a Brother meets a Brother 
they can know it. That way that thing
what happened to Brother Tod Clifton 
wouldn't have happened . . ."
"What wouldn't have happened?"
He sat back. "Don't you know about it?"
"I don't know what you mean."
"It's something that's best forgot 
about," he said, leaning close, his
big hands gripped and stretched before 
him. "But you see, there was a rally
and some hoodlums tried to break up the 
meeting, and in the fighting
Brother Tod Clifton got holt to one of 
the white brothers by mistake and was

beating him, thought he was one of the 
hoodlums, he said. Things like that is
bad, Brother, very bad. But with some 
of these emblems, things like that
wouldn't happen."
"So that actually happened," I said.
"Sure did. That Brother Clifton goes 
wild when he gits mad . . . But
what do you think of my idea?"
"I think it should be brought to the 
attention of the committee," I
said guardedly, as the phone rang. 
"Excuse me a moment, Brother," I said.
It was the editor of a new picture 
magazine requesting an interview
of "one of our most successful young 
men."
"That's very flattering," I said, "but 
I'm afraid I'm too busy for an
interview. I suggest, however, that you 
interview our youth leader, Brother
Tod Clifton; you'll find him a much 
more interesting subject."
"No, no!" Wrestrum said, shaking his 
head violently as the editor
said, "But we want you. You've --"
"And

you

know,"

I

interrupted,

"our

work

is

considered

very

controversial, certainly by some."
"That's exactly why we want you. You've 
become identified with that
controversy and it's our job to bring 
such subjects to the eyes of our
readers."
"But so has Brother Clifton," I said.
"No, sir; you're the man and you owe it 
to our youth to allow us to
tell them your story," he said, as I 
watched Brother Wrestrum leaning
forward. "We feel that they should be 
encouraged to keep fighting toward
success. After all, you're one of the 
latest to fight his way to the top. We
need all the heroes we can get."
"But, please," I laughed over the 
phone, "I'm no hero and I'm far
from the top; I'm a cog in a machine. 
We here in the Brotherhood work as a
unit," I said, seeing Brother Wrestrum 
nod his head in agreement.
"But you can't get around the fact that 
you're the first of our people
to attract attention to it, can you 
now?"
"Brother Clifton was active at least 
three years before me. Besides, it
isn't that simple. Individuals don't 
count for much; it's what the group 
wants,
what the group does. Everyone here 
submerges his personal ambitions for the
common achievement."

"Good! That's very good. People want to 
hear that. Our people need
to have someone say that to them. Why 
don't you let me send out an
interviewer? I'll have her there in 
twenty minutes."
"You're very insistent, but I'm very 
busy," I said.
And if Brother Wrestrum hadn't been 
wig-wagging, trying to tell me
what to say I would have refused. 
Instead, I consented. Perhaps, I 
thought, a
little friendly publicity wouldn't 
hurt. Such a magazine would reach many
timid souls living far from the sound 
of our voices. I had only to remember
to say little about my past.
"I'm sorry for this interruption, 
Brother," I said, putting down the
phone and looking into his curious 
eyes. "I'll bring your idea to the 
attention
of the committee as quickly as 
possible."
I stood to discourage further talk and 
he got up, fairly bursting to
continue.
"Well, I've got to see some other 
brothers myself," he said, "I'll be
seeing you soon."
"Anytime," I said, avoiding his hand by 
picking up some papers.
Going out, he turned with his hand on 
the door frame, frowning.
"And, Brother, don't forget what I said 
about that thing you got on your
desk. Things like that don't do nothin' 
but cause confusion. They ought to be
kept out of sight."
I was glad to see him go. The idea of 
his trying to tell me what to
say in a conversation only part of 
which he could have heard! And it was
obvious that he disliked Clifton. Well, 
I disliked him. And all that foolishness
and fear over the leg chain. Tarp had 
worn it for nineteen years and could
laugh, but this big -Then I forgot 
Brother Wrestrum until about two weeks 
later at our
downtown headquarters, where a meeting 
had been called to discuss strategy.

EVERYONE had arrived before me. Long 
benches were arranged at
one side of the room, which was hot and 
filled with smoke. Usually such
meetings sounded like a prizefight or a 
smoker, but now everyone was silent.
The white brothers looked uncomfortable 
and some of the Harlem brothers
belligerent. Nor did they leave me time 
to think about it. No sooner had I

apologized for my lateness than Brother 
Jack struck the table with his gavel,
addressing his first remarks to me.
"Brother, there seems to be a serious 
misunderstanding among some
of the brothers concerning your work 
and recent conduct," he said.
I stared at him blankly, my mind 
groping for connections. "I'm sorry,
Brother Jack," I said, "but I don't 
understand. You mean there's something
wrong with my work?"
"So it seems," he said, his face 
completely neutral. "Certain charges
have just been made . . ."
"Charges? Have I failed to carry out 
some directive?"
"About that there seems to be some 
doubt. But we'd better let
Brother Wrestrum speak of this," he 
said.
"Brother Wrestrum!"
I was shocked. He hadn't been around 
since our talk, and I looked
across the table into his evasive face, 
seeing him stand with a slouch, a rolled
paper protruding from his pocket.
"Yes, Brothers," he said, "I brought 
charges, much as I hated to have
to do it. But I been watching the way 
things have been going and I've
decided that if they don't stop soon, 
this brother is going to make a fool out
of the Brotherhood!"
There were some sounds of protest.
"Yes, I said it and I mean it! This 
here brother constitutes one of
the greatest dangers ever confronted by 
our movement."
I looked at Brother Jack; his eyes were 
sparkling. I seemed to see
traces of a smile as he scribbled 
something on a pad. I was becoming very
hot.
"Be more specific, Brother," Brother 
Garnett, a white brother, said.
"These are serious charges and we all 
know that the brother's work has been
splendid. Be specific."
"Sho, I'll be specific," Wrestrum 
boomed, suddenly whipping the
paper from his pocket, unrolling it and 
throwing it on the table. "This here's
what I mean!"
I took a step forward; it was a 
portrait of me looking out from a
magazine page.
"Where did that come from?" I said.

"That's it," he boomed. "Make out like 
you never seen it."
"But I haven't," I said. "I really 
haven't."
"Don't lie to these white brothers. 
Don't lie!"
"I'm not lying. I never saw it before 
in my life. But suppose I had,
what's wrong with it?"
"You know what's wrong!" Wrestrum said.
"Look, I don't know anything. What's on 
your mind? You have us all
here, so if you have anything to say, 
please get it over with."
"Brothers, this man is a -- a -- 
opportunist! All you got to do is read
this article to see. I charge this man 
with using the Brotherhood movement
to advance his own selfish interests."
"Article?" Then I remembered the 
interview which I had forgotten. I
met the eyes of the others as they 
looked from me to Wrestrum.
"And what does it say about us?" 
Brother Jack said, pointing to the
magazine.
"Say?" Wrestrum said. "It doesn't say 
anything. It's all about him.
What he thinks, what he does; what he's 
going to do. Not a word about the
rest of us who's been building the 
movement before he was ever heard of.
Look at it, if you think I'm lying. 
Look at it!"
Brother Jack turned to me. "Is this 
true?"
"I haven't read it," I said. "I had 
forgotten that I was interviewed."
"But you remember it now?" Brother Jack 
said.
"Yes, I do now. And he happened to be 
in the office when the
appointment was made."
They were silent.
"Hell, Brother Jack," Wrestrum said, 
"it's right here in black and
white. He's trying to give people the 
idea that he's the whole Brotherhood
movement."
"I'm doing nothing of the sort. I tried 
to get the editor to interview
Brother Tod Clifton, you know that. 
Since you know so little about what I'm
doing, why not tell the brothers what 
you're up to."
"I'm exposing a double-dealer, that's 
what I'm doing. I'm exposing
you. Brothers, this man is a pure dee 
opportunist!"
"All right," I said, "expose me if you 
can, but stop the slander."
"I'll expose you, all right," he said, 
sticking out his chin. "I'm going

to. He's doing everything I said, 
Brothers. And I'll tell you something 
else -he's trying to sew things up so 
that the members won't move unless he 
tells
them to. Look at a few weeks ago when 
he was off in Philly. We tried to get
a rally going and what happens? Only 
about two hundred people turned out.
He's trying to train them so they won't 
listen to no one but him."
"But, Brother, didn't we decide that 
the appeal had been improperly
phrased?" a brother interrupted.
"Yeah, I know, but that wasn't it . . ."
"But the committee analyzed the appeal 
and --"
"I know, Brothers, and I don't aim to 
dispute the committee. But,
Brothers, it just seems that way 'cause 
you don't know this man. He works in
the dark, he's got some kind of plot . 
. ."
"What kind of plot?" one of the 
brothers said, leaning across the
table.
"Just a plot," Wrestrum said. "He aims 
to control the movement
uptown. He wants to be a dictator!"
The room was silent except for the 
humming of fans. They looked at
him with a new concern.
"These are very serious charges, 
Brother," two brothers said in
unison.
"Serious? I know they're serious. 
That's how come I brought them.
This opportunist thinks that because 
he's got a little more education he's
better than anybody else. He's what 
Brother Jack calls a petty -- petty
individualist!"
He struck the conference table with his 
fist, his eyes showing small
and round in his taut face. I wanted to 
punch that face. It no longer seemed
real, but a mask behind which the real 
face was probably laughing, both at
me and at the others. For he couldn't 
believe what he had said. It just wasn't
possible. He was the plotter and from 
the serious looks on the committee's
faces he was getting away with it. Now 
several brothers started to speak at
once, and Brother Jack knocked for 
order.
"Brothers, please!" Brother Jack said. 
"One at a time. What do you
know about this article?" he said to me.
"Not very much," I said. "The editor of 
the magazine called to say he
was sending a reporter up for an 
interview. The reporter asked a few

questions and took a few pictures with 
a little camera. That's all I know."
"Did you give the reporter a prepared 
handout?"
"I gave her nothing except a few pieces 
of our official literature. I
told her neither what to ask me nor 
what to write. I naturally tried to
co-operate. If an article about me 
would help make friends for the movement
I felt it was my duty."
"Brothers, this thing was arranged," 
Wrestrum said. "I tell you this
opportunist had that reporter sent up 
there. He had her sent up and he told
her what to write."
"That's a contemptible lie," I said. 
"You were present and you know I
tried to get them to interview Brother 
Clifton!"
"Who's a lie?"
"You're a liar and a fat-mouthed 
scoundrel. You're a liar and no
brother of mine."
"Now he's calling me names. Brothers, 
you heard him."
"Let's not lose our tempers," Brother 
Jack said calmly. "Brother
Wrestrum, you've made serious charges. 
Can you prove them?"
"I can prove them. All you have to do 
is read the magazine and
prove them for yourself;"
"It will be read. And what else?"
"All you have to do is listen to folks 
in Harlem. All they talk about
is him. Never nothing about what the 
rest of us do. I tell you, Brothers, 
this
man constitutes a danger to the people 
of Harlem. He ought to be thrown
out!"
"That is for the committee to decide," 
Brother Jack said. Then to me,
"And what have you to say in your 
defense, Brother?"
"In my defense?" I said, "Nothing. I 
haven't anything to defend. I've
tried to do my work and if the brothers 
don't know that, then it's too late to
tell them. I don't know what's behind 
this, but I haven't gotten around to
controlling magazine writers. And I 
didn't realize that I was coming to 
stand
trial either."
"This was not intended as a trial," 
Brother Jack said. "If you're ever
put on trial, and I hope you'll never 
be, you'll know it. Meantime, since this
is an emergency the committee asks that 
you leave the room while we read
and discuss the questioned interview."

I left the room and went into a vacant 
office, boiling with anger and
disgust. Wrestrum had snatched me back 
to the South in the midst of one of
the top Brotherhood committees and I 
felt naked. I could have throttled him
-- forcing me to take part in a 
childish dispute before the others. Yet 
I had
to fight him as I could, in terms he 
understood, even though we sounded like
characters in a razor-slinging 
vaudeville skit. Perhaps I should 
mention the
anonymous note, except that someone 
might take it to mean that I didn't
have the full support of my district. 
If Clifton were here, he'd know how to
handle this clown. Were they taking him 
seriously just because he was black?
What was wrong with them anyway, 
couldn't they see that they were dealing
with a clown? But I would have gone to 
pieces had they laughed or even
smiled, I thought, for they couldn't 
laugh at him without laughing at me as
well . . . Yet if they had laughed, it 
would have been less unreal -- Where
the hell am I?
"You can come in now," a brother called 
to me; and I went out to
hear their decision.
"Well," Brother Jack said, "we've all 
read the article, Brother, and
we're happy to report that we found it 
harmless enough. True, it would have
been better had more wordage been given 
to other members of the Harlem
district. But we found no evidence that 
you had anything to do with that.
Brother Wrestrum was mistaken."
His bland manner and the knowledge that 
they had wasted time to
see the truth released the anger within 
me.
"I'd say that he was criminally 
mistaken," I said.
"Not criminal, over-zealous," he said.
"To me it seems both criminal and 
over-zealous," I said.
"No, Brother, not criminal."
"But he attacked my reputation . . ."
Brother Jack smiled. "Only because he 
was sincere, Brother. He was
thinking of the good of the 
Brotherhood."
"But why slander me? I don't follow 
you, Brother Jack. I'm no
enemy, as he well knows. I'm a brother 
too," I said, seeing his smile.
"The Brotherhood has many enemies, and 
we must not be too harsh
with brotherly mistakes."
Then I saw the foolish, abashed 
expression on Wrestrum's face and

relaxed.
"Very well, Brother Jack," I said. "I 
suppose I should be glad you
found me innocent --"
"Concerning the magazine article," he 
said, stabbing the air with his
finger.
Something tensed in the back of my 
head; I got to my feet.
"Concerning the article! You mean to 
say that you believe that other
pipe-dream? Is everyone reading Dick 
Tracy these days?"
"This is no matter of Dick Tracy," he 
snapped. "The movement has
many enemies."
"So now I have become an enemy," I 
said. "What's happened to
everybody? You act as though none of 
you has any contact with me at all."
Jack looked at the table. "Are you 
interested in our decision,
Brother?"
"Oh, yes," I said. "Yes, I am. I'm 
interested in all manner of odd
behavior. Who wouldn't be, when one 
wild man can make a roomful of what
I'd come to regard as some of the best 
minds in the country take him
seriously. Certainly, I'm interested. 
Otherwise I'd act like a sensible man 
and
run out of here!"
There were sounds of protest and 
Brother Jack, his face red, rapped
for order.
"Perhaps I should address a few words 
to the brother," Brother
MacAfee said.
"Go ahead," Brother Jack said thickly.
"Brother, we understand how you feel," 
Brother MacAfee said, "but
you must understand that the movement 
has many enemies. This is very true,
and we are forced to think of the 
organization at the expense of our 
personal
feelings. The Brotherhood is bigger 
than all of us. None of us as 
individuals
count when its safety is questioned. 
And be assured that none of us have
anything but goodwill toward you 
personally. Your work has been splendid.
This is simply a matter of the safety 
of the organization, and it is our
responsibility to make a thorough 
investigation of all such charges."
I felt suddenly empty; there was a 
logic in what he said which I felt
compelled to accept. They were wrong, 
but they had the obligation to discover
their mistake. Let them go ahead, 
they'd find that none of the charges 
were

true and I'd be vindicated. What was 
all this obsession with enemies anyway?
I looked into their smoke-washed faces; 
not since the beginning had I faced
such serious doubts. Up to now I had 
felt a wholeness about my work and
direction such as I'd never known; not 
even in my mistaken college days.
Brotherhood was something to which men 
could give themselves completely;
that was its strength and my strength, 
and it was this sense of wholeness
that guaranteed that it would change 
the course of history. This I had
believed with all my being, but now, 
though still inwardly affirming that
belief, I felt a blighting hurt which 
prevented me from trying further to
defend

myself.

I

stood

there

silently,

waiting

their

decision.

Someone

drummed his fingers against the table 
top. I heard the dry-leaf rustle of
onionskin papers.
"Be assured that you can depend upon 
the fairness and wisdom of
the committee," Brother Tobitt's voice 
drifted from the end of the table, but
there was smoke between us and I could 
barely see his face.
"The committee has decided," Brother 
Jack began crisply, "that until
all charges have been cleared, you are 
to have the choice of becoming
inactive in Harlem, or accepting an 
assignment downtown. In the latter case
you are to wind up your present 
assignment immediately."
I felt weak in my legs. "You mean I am 
to give up my work?"
"Unless you choose to serve the 
movement elsewhere."
"But can't you see --" I said, looking 
from face to face and seeing
the blank finality in their eyes.
"Your assignment, should you decide to 
remain active," Brother Jack
said, reaching for his gavel, "is to 
lecture downtown on the Woman
Question."
Suddenly I felt as though I had been 
spun like a top.
"The what!"
"The Woman Question. My pamphlet, 'On 
the Woman Question in
the United States,' will be your guide. 
And now, Brothers," he said, his eyes
sweeping around the table, "the meeting 
is adjourned."
I stood there, hearing the rapping of 
his gavel echoing in my ears,
thinking

the

woman

question

and

searching

their

faces

for

signs

of

amusement, listening to their voices as 
they filed out into the hall for the
slightest sound of suppressed laughter, 
stood there fighting the sense that I

had just been made the butt of an 
outrageous joke and all the more so 
since
their faces revealed no awareness.
My mind fought desperately for 
acceptance. Nothing would change
matters. They would shift me and 
investigate and I, still believing, 
still
bending to discipline, would have to 
accept their decision. Now was certainly
no time for inactivity; not just when I 
was beginning to approach some of
the aspects of the organization about 
which I knew nothing (of higher
committees and the leaders who never 
appeared, of the sympathizers and
allies in groups that seemed far 
removed from our concerns), not at a 
time
when all the secrets of power and 
authority still shrouded from me in
mystery appeared on the way toward 
revelation. No, despite my anger and
disgust, my ambitions were too great to 
surrender so easily. And why should
I restrict myself, segregate myself? I 
was a spokesman -- why shouldn't I
speak about women, or any other 
subject? Nothing lay outside the scheme 
of
our ideology, there was a policy on 
everything, and my main concern was to
work my way ahead in the movement.
I left the building still feeling as 
though I had been violently spun
but with optimism growing. Being 
removed from Harlem was a shock but one
which would hurt them as much as me, 
for I had learned that the clue to
what Harlem wanted was what I wanted; 
and my value to the Brotherhood
was no different from the value to me 
of my most useful contact: it
depended

upon

my

complete

frankness

and

honesty

in

stating

the

community's hopes and hates, fears and 
desires. One spoke to the committee
as well as to the community. No doubt 
it would work much the same
downtown. The new assignment was a 
challenge and an opportunity for
testing how much of what happened in 
Harlem was due to my own efforts
and how much to the sheer eagerness of 
the people themselves. And, after
all, I told myself, the assignment was 
also proof of the committee's goodwill.
For by selecting me to speak with its 
authority on a subject which elsewhere
in our society I'd have found taboo, 
weren't they reaffirming their belief 
both
in me and in the principles of 
Brotherhood, proving that they drew no 
lines
even when it came to women? They had to 
investigate the charges against
me, but the assignment was their 
unsentimental affirmation that their 
belief
in me was unbroken. I shivered in the 
hot street. I hadn't allowed the idea to
take concrete form in my mind, but for 
a moment I had almost allowed an

old, southern backwardness which I had 
thought dead to wreck my career.
Leaving Harlem was not without its 
regrets, however, and I couldn't
bring myself to say good-bye to anyone, 
not even to Brother Tarp or Clifton
-- not to mention the others upon whom 
I depended for information
concerning the lowest groups in the 
community. I simply slipped my papers
into my brief case and left as though 
going downtown for a meeting.

I went to my first lecture with a sense 
of excitement. The theme was
a sure-fire guarantee of audience 
interest and the rest was up to me. If 
only
I were a foot taller and a hundred 
pounds heavier, I could simply stand
before them with a sign across my 
chest, stating i KNOW ALL ABOUT
THEM, and they'd be as awed as though I 
were the original boogey man -somehow 
reformed and domesticated. I'd no more 
have to speak than Paul
Robeson had to act; they'd simply 
thrill at the sight of me.
And it went well enough; they made it a 
success through their own
enthusiasm, and the barrage of 
questions afterwards left no doubts in 
my
mind. It was only after the meeting was 
breaking up that there came the
developments which even my volatile 
suspicions hadn't allowed me to foresee.
I was exchanging greetings with the 
audience when she appeared, the kind of
woman who glows as though consciously 
acting a symbolic role of life and
feminine fertility. Her problem, she 
said, had to do with certain aspects of
our ideology.
"It's rather involved, really," she 
said with concern, "and while I
shouldn't care to take up your time, I 
have a feeling that you --"
"Oh, not at all," I said, guiding her 
away from the others to stand
near a partly uncoiled firehose hanging 
beside the entrance, "not at all."
"But, Brother," she said, "it's really 
so late and you must be tired.
My problem could wait until some other 
time . . ."
"I'm not that tired," I said. "And if 
there's something bothering you,

it's my duty to do what I can to clear 
it up."
"But it's quite late," she said. 
"Perhaps some evening when you're not
busy you'll drop in to see us. Then we 
could talk at greater length. Unless, of
course. . ."
"Unless?"
"Unless," she smiled, "I can induce you 
to stop by this evening. I
might add that I serve a fair cup of 
coffee."
"Then I'm at your service," I said, 
pushing open the door.
Her apartment was located in one of the 
better sections of the city,
and I must have revealed my surprise 
upon entering the spacious living room.
"You can see, Brother" -- the glow she 
gave the word was disturbing
-- "it is really the spiritual values 
of Brotherhood that interest me. Through
no effort of my own, I have economic 
security and leisure, but what is that,
really, when so much is wrong with the 
world? I mean when there is no
spiritual or emotional security, and no 
justice?"
She was slipping out of her coat now, 
looking earnestly into my face,
and I thought, Is she a Salvationist, a 
Puritan-with-reverse-English? 
-remembering Brother Jack's private 
description of wealthy members who, he
said, sought political salvation by 
contributing financially to the 
Brotherhood.
She was going a little fast for me and 
I looked at her gravely.
"I can see that you've thought deeply 
about this thing," I said.
"I've tried," she said, "and it's most 
perplexing -- But make yourself
comfortable while I put away my things."
She was a small, delicately plump woman 
with raven hair in which a
thin streak of white had begun almost 
imperceptibly to show, and when she
reappeared in the rich red of a hostess 
gown she was so striking that I had
to avert my somewhat startled eyes.
"What a beautiful room you have here," 
I said, looking across the
rich cherry glow of furniture to see a 
life-sized painting of a nude, a pink
Renoir. Other canvases were hung here 
and there, and the spacious walls
seemed to flash alive with warm, pure 
color. What does one say to all this? I
thought, looking at an abstract fish of 
polished brass mounted on a piece of
ebony.
"I'm glad you find it pleasant, 
Brother," she said. "We like it
ourselves, though I must say that 
Hubert finds so little time to enjoy 
it. He's

much too busy."
"Hubert?" I said.
"My husband. Unfortunately he had to 
leave. He would have loved
to've met you, but then he's always 
dashing off. Business, you know."
"I suppose it's unavoidable," I said 
with sudden discomfort.
"Yes, it is," she said. "But we're 
going to discuss Brotherhood and
ideology, aren't we?"
And there was something about her voice 
and her smile that gave me
a sense of both comfort and excitement. 
It was not merely the background of
wealth and gracious living, to which I 
was alien, but simply the being there
with her and the sensed possibility of 
a heightened communication; as though
the discordantly invisible and the 
conspicuously enigmatic were reaching a
delicately balanced harmony. She's rich 
but human, I thought, watching the
smooth play of her relaxed hands.
"There are so many aspects to the 
movement," I said. "Just where
shall we start? Perhaps it's something 
that I'm unable to handle."
"Oh, it's nothing that profound," she 
said. "I'm sure you'll straighten
out my little ideological twists and 
turns. But sit here on the sofa, 
Brother;
it's more comfortable."
I sat, seeing her go toward a door, the 
train of her gown trailing
sensuously over the oriental carpet. 
Then she turned and smiled.
"Perhaps you'd prefer wine or milk 
instead of coffee?"
"Wine, thank you," I said, finding the 
idea of milk strangely
repulsive. This isn't at all what I 
expected, I thought. She returned with a
tray holding two glasses and a 
decanter, placing them before us on a 
low
cocktail table, and I could hear the 
wine trickle musically into the glasses,
one of which she placed in front of me.
"Here's to the movement," she said, 
raising her glass with smiling
eyes.
"To the movement," I said.
"And to Brotherhood."
"And to Brotherhood."
"This is very nice," I said, seeing her 
nearly closed eyes, her chin
tilting upward, toward me, "but just 
what phase of our ideology should we
discuss?"

"All of it," she said. "I wish to 
embrace the whole of it. Life is so
terribly empty and disorganized without 
it. I sincerely believe that only
Brotherhood offers any hope of making 
life worth living again -- Oh, I know
that it's too vast a philosophy to 
grasp immediately, as it were; still, 
it's so
vital and alive that one gets the 
feeling that one should at least make 
the try.
Don't you agree?"
"Well, yes," I said. "It's the most 
meaningful thing that I know."
"Oh, I'm so pleased to have you agree 
with me. I suppose that's why
I always thrill to hear you speak, 
somehow you convey the great throbbing
vitality of the movement. It's really 
amazing. You give me such a feeling of
security -- although," she interrupted 
herself with a mysterious smile, "I must
confess that you also make me afraid."
"Afraid? You can't mean that," I said.
"Really," she repeated, as I laughed. 
"It's so powerful, so -- so
primitive!"
I felt some of the air escape from the 
room, leaving it unnaturally
quiet. "You don't mean primitive?" I 
said.
"Yes, primitive; no one has told you, 
Brother, that at times you have
tom-toms beating in your voice?"
"My God," I laughed, "I thought that 
was the beat of profound
ideas."
"Of course, you're correct," she said. 
"I don't mean really primitive. I
suppose I mean forceful, powerful. It 
takes hold of one's emotions as well as
one's intellect. Call it what you will, 
it has so much naked power that it goes
straight through one. I tremble just to 
think of such vitality."
I looked at her, so close now that I 
could see a single jet-black
strand of out-of-place hair. "Yes," I 
said, "the emotion is there; but it's
actually our scientific approach that 
releases it. As Brother Jack says, we're
nothing if not organizers. And the 
emotion isn't merely released, it's 
guided,
channelized -- that is the real source 
of our effectiveness. After all, this 
very
good wine can please emotion, but I 
doubt seriously that it can organize
anything."
She leaned gracefully forward, her arm 
along the back of the sofa,
saying, "Yes, and you do both in your 
speeches. One just has to respond,
even when one isn't too clear as to 
your meaning. Only I do know what

you're saying and that's even more 
inspiring."
"Actually, you know, I'm as much 
affected by the audience as it is by
me. Its response helps me do my best."
"And there's another important aspect," 
she said; "one which concerns
me greatly. It provides women the full 
opportunity for self-expression, which
is so very important, Brother. It's as 
though every day were Leap Year -which 
is as it should be. Women should be 
absolutely as free as men."
And if I were really free, I thought, 
lifting my glass, I'd get the hell
out of here.
"I thought you were exceptionally good 
tonight -- it's time the woman
had a champion in the movement. Until 
tonight I'd always heard you on
minority problems."
"This is a new assignment," I said. 
"But from now on one of our
main concerns is to be the Woman 
Question."
"That's wonderful and it's about time. 
Something has to give women
an opportunity to come to close grips 
with life. Please go on, tell me your
ideas," she said, pressing forward, her 
hand light upon my arm.
And I went on talking, relieved to 
talk, carried away by my own
enthusiasm and by the warmth of the 
wine. And it was only when I turned
to ask a question of her that I 
realized that she was leaning only a 
nose-tip
away, her eyes upon my face.
"Go on, please go on," I heard. "You 
make it sound so clear -please."
I saw the rapid, moth-wing fluttering 
of her lids become the softness
of her lips as we were drawn together. 
There was not an idea or concept in
it but sheer warmth; then the bell was 
ringing and I shook it off and got to
my feet, hearing it ring again as she 
arose with me, the red robe falling in
heavy folds upon the carpet, and she 
saying, "You make it all so wonderfully
alive," as the bell sounded again. And 
I was trying to move, to get out of the
apartment, looking for my hat and 
filling with anger, thinking, Is she 
crazy?
Doesn't she hear? as she stood before 
me in bewilderment, as though I were
acting irrationally. And now taking my 
arm with sudden energy, saying, "This
way, in here," almost pulling me along 
as the bell rang again, through a door
down a short hall, a satiny bedroom, in 
which she stood appraising me with
a smile, saying, "This is mine," as I 
looked at her in outrageous disbelief.

"Yours, yours? But what about that 
bell?"
"Never mind," she cooed, looking into 
my eyes.
"But be reasonable," I said, pushing 
her aside. "What about that
door?"
"Oh, of course, you mean the telephone, 
don't you, darling?"
"But your old man -- your husband?"
"In Chicago --"
"But he might not --"
"No, no, darling, he won't --"
"But he might!"
"But, Brother, darling, I talked with 
him, I know."
"You what? What kind of game is this?"
"Oh, you poor darling! It isn't a game, 
really you have no cause to
worry, we're free. He's in Chicago, 
seeking his lost youth, no doubt," she 
said,
bursting into laughter of 
self-surprise. "He's not at all 
interested in uplifting
things -- freedom and necessity, 
woman's rights and all that. You know, 
the
sickness of our class -- Brother, 
darling."
I took a step across the room; there 
was another door to my left
through which I saw the gleam of 
chromium and tile.
"Brotherhood, darling," she said, 
gripping my biceps with her little
hands.

"Teach

me,

talk

to

me.

Teach

me

the

beautiful

ideology

of

Brotherhood." And I wanted both to 
smash her and to stay with her and
knew that I should do neither. Was she 
trying to ruin me, or was this a trap
set by some secret enemy of the 
movement waiting outside the door with
cameras and wrecking bars?
"You should answer the phone," I said 
with forced calm, trying to
release my hands without touching her, 
for if I touched her -"And you'll 
continue?" she said.
I nodded, seeing her turn without a 
word and go toward a vanity
with a large oval mirror, taking up an 
ivory telephone. And in the mirrored
instant I saw myself standing between 
her eager form and a huge white bed,
myself caught in a guilty stance, my 
face taut, tie dangling; and behind the
bed another mirror which now like a 
surge of the sea tossed our images back
and forth, back and forth, furiously 
multiplying the time and the place and
the circumstance. My vision seemed to 
pulse alternately clear and vague,

driven by a furious bellows, as her 
lips said soundlessly, I'm sorry, and 
then
impatiently into the telephone, "Yes, 
this is she," and then to me again,
smiling as she covered the mouthpiece 
with her hand, "It's only my sister;
it'll only take a second." And my mind 
whirled with forgotten stories of male
servants summoned to wash the 
mistress's back; chauffeurs sharing the
masters' wives; Pullman porters invited 
into the drawing room of rich wives
headed for Reno -- thinking, But this 
is the movement, the Brotherhood. And
now I saw her smile, saying, "Yes, 
Gwen, dear. Yes," as one free hand went
up as though to smooth her hair and in 
one swift motion the red robe swept
aside like a veil, and I went 
breathless, at the petite and 
generously curved
nude, framed delicate and firm in the 
glass. It was like a dream interval and
in an instant it swung back and I saw 
only her mysteriously smiling eyes
above the rich red robe.
I was heading for the door, torn 
between anger and a fierce
excitement, hearing the phone click 
down as I started past and feeling her
swirl against me and I was lost, for 
the conflict between the ideological and
the biological, duty and desire, had 
become too subtly confused. I went to
her, thinking, Let them break down the 
door, whosoever will, let them come.

I DIDN'T know whether I was awake or 
dreaming. It was dead quiet,
yet I was certain that there had been a 
noise and that it had come from
across the room as she beside me made a 
soft sighing sound. It was strange.
My mind revolved. I was chased out of a 
chinkapin woods by a bull. I ran
up a hill; the whole hill heaved. I 
heard the sound and looked up to see the
man looking straight at me from where 
he stood in the dim light of the hall,
looking in with neither interest nor 
surprise. His face expressionless, his 
eyes
staring. There was the sound of even 
breathing. Then I heard her stir beside
me.
"Oh, hello, dear," she said, her voice 
sounding far away. "Back so
soon?"
"Yes," he said. "Wake me early, I have 
a lot to do."
"I'll remember, dear," she said 
sleepily. "Have a good night's rest . .
."
"Night, and you too," he said with a 
short dry laugh.

The door closed. I lay there in the 
dark for a while, breathing
rapidly. It was strange. I reached out 
and touched her. There was no answer.
I leaned over her, feeling her breath 
breezing warm and pure against my face.
I wanted to linger there, experiencing 
the sensation of something precious
perilously attained too late and now to 
be lost forever -- a poignancy. But it
was as though she'd never been awake 
and if she should awaken now, she'd
scream, shriek. I slid hurriedly from 
the bed, keeping my eye on that part of
the darkness from where the light had 
come as I tried to find my clothes. I
blundered around, finding a chair, an 
empty chair. Where were my clothes?
What a fool! Why had I gotten myself 
into such a situation? I felt my way
naked through darkness, found the chair 
with my clothes, dressed hurriedly
and slipped out, halting only at the 
door to look back through the dim light
from the hall. She slept without sigh 
or smile, a beautiful dreamer, one ivory
arm flung above her jet-black head. My 
heart pounded as I closed the door
and went down the hall, expecting the 
man, men, crowds -- to halt me. Then
I was taking the stairs.
The building was quiet. In the lobby 
the doorman dozed, his starched
bib buckling beneath his chin with his 
breathing, his white head bare. I
reached the street limp with 
perspiration, still unsure whether I 
had seen the
man or had dreamed him. Could I have 
seen him without his seeing me? Or
again, had he seen me and been silent 
out of sophistication, decadence,
over-civilization? I hurried down the 
street, my anxiety growing with each
step. Why hadn't he said something, 
recognized me, cursed me? Attacked me?
Or at least been outraged with her? And 
what if it were a test to discover
how I would react to such pressure? It 
was, after all, a point upon which our
enemies would attack us violently. I 
walked in a sweat of agony. Why did
they have to mix their women into 
everything? Between us and everything we
wanted to change in the world they 
placed a woman: socially, politically,
economically. Why, goddamit, why did 
they insist upon confusing the class
struggle with the ass struggle, 
debasing both us and them -- all human
motives?
All the next day I was in a state of 
exhaustion, waiting tensely for
the plan to be revealed. Now I was 
certain that the man had been in the
doorway, a man with a brief case who 
had looked in and given no definite
sign that he had seen me. A man who had 
spoken like an indifferent

husband, but who yet seemed to recall 
to me some important member of the
Brotherhood -- someone so familiar that 
my failure to identify him was
driving me almost to distraction. My 
work lay untouched before me. Each
ring of the telephone filled me with 
dread. I toyed with Tarp's leg chain.
If they don't call by four o'clock, I'm 
saved, I told myself. But still
no sign, not even a call to a meeting. 
Finally I rang her number, hearing her
voice, delighted, gay and discreet; but 
no mention of the night or the man.
And hearing her so composed and gay I 
was too embarrassed to bring it up.
Perhaps this was the sophisticated and 
civilized way? Perhaps he was there
and they had an understanding, a woman 
with full rights.
Would I return for further discussion, 
she wanted to know.
"Yes, of course," I said.
"Oh, Brother," she said.
I hung up with a mixture of relief and 
anxiety, unable to shrug off
the notion that I had been tested and 
had failed. I went through the next
week puzzling over it, and even more 
confused because I knew nothing
definite of where I stood. I tried to 
detect any changes in my relations with
Brother Jack and the others, but they 
gave no sign. And even if they had, I
wouldn't have known its definite 
meaning, for it might have had to do 
with
the charges. I was caught between guilt 
and innocence, so that now they
seemed one and the same. My nerves were 
in a state of constant tension, my
face took on a stiff, non-committal 
expression, beginning to look like 
Brother
Jack's and the other leaders'. Then I 
relaxed a bit; work had to be done and
I would play the waiting game. And 
despite my guilt and uncertainty I
learned to forget that I was a lone 
guilty black Brother and to go striding
confidently into a roomful of whites. 
It was chin up, a not too wide-stretched
smile, the out-thrust hand for the firm 
warm hand shake. And with it just
the proper mixture of arrogance and 
down-to-earth humility to satisfy all. I
threw myself into the lectures, 
defending, asserting the rights of 
women; and
though the girls continued to buzz 
around, I was careful to keep the
biological and ideological carefully 
apart -- which wasn't always easy, for 
it
was as though many of the sisters were 
agreed among themselves (and
assumed that I accepted it) that the 
ideological was merely a superfluous 
veil
for the real concerns of life.
I found that most downtown audiences 
seemed to expect some

unnamed something whenever I appeared. 
I could sense it the moment I
stood before them, and it had nothing 
to do with anything I might say. For I
had merely to appear before them, and 
from the moment they turned their
eyes upon me they seemed to undergo a 
strange unburdening -- not of
laughter, nor of tears, nor of any 
stable, unmixed emotion. I didn't get 
it.
And my guilt was aroused. Once in the 
middle of a passage I looked into the
sea of faces and thought, Do they know? 
Is that it? -- and almost ruined my
lecture. But of one thing I was 
certain, it was not the same attitude 
they held
for certain other black brothers who 
entertained them with stories so often
that they laughed even before these 
fellows opened their mouths. No, it was
something else. A form of expectancy, a 
mood of waiting, a hoping for
something like justification; as though 
they expected me to be more than just
another speaker, or an entertainer. 
Something seemed to occur that was
hidden from my own consciousness. I 
acted out a pantomime more eloquent
than my most expressive words. I was a 
partner to it but could no more
fathom it than I could the mystery of 
the man in the doorway. Perhaps, I
told myself, it's in your voice, after 
all. In your voice and in their desire 
to
see in you a living proof of their 
belief in Brotherhood, and to ease my 
mind
I stopped thinking about it.
Then one night when I had fallen asleep 
while making notes for a
new series of lectures, the phone 
summoned me to an emergency meeting at
headquarters, and I left the house with 
feelings of dread. This is it, I 
thought,
either the charges or the woman. To be 
tripped up by a woman! What would
I say to them, that she was 
irresistible and I human? What had that 
to do
with responsibility, with building 
Brotherhood?
It was all I could do to make myself 
go, and I arrived late. The
room was sweltering; three small fans 
stirred the heavy air, and the brothers
sat in their shirtsleeves around a 
scarred table upon which a pitcher of 
iced
water glistened with beads of moisture.
"Brothers, I'm sorry I'm late," I 
apologized. "There were some
important last-minute details 
concerning tomorrow's lecture that kept 
me."
"Then you might have saved yourself the 
trouble and the committee
this lost time," Brother Jack said.
"I don't understand you," I said, 
suddenly feverish.
"He means that you are no longer to 
concern yourself with the

Woman Question. That's ended," Brother 
Tobitt said; and I braced myself for
the attack, but before I could respond 
Brother Jack fired a startling question
at me.
"What has become of Brother Tod 
Clifton?"
"Brother Clifton -- why, I haven't seen 
him in weeks. I've been too
busy downtown here. What's happened?"
"He has disappeared," Brother Jack 
said, "disappeared! So don't waste
time with superfluous questions. You 
weren't sent for for that."
"But how long has this been known?"
Brother Jack struck the table. "All we 
know is that he's gone. Let's
get on with our business. You, Brother, 
are to return to Harlem immediately.
We're facing a crisis there, since 
Brother Tod Clifton has not only 
disappeared
but failed in his assignment. On the 
other hand, Ras the Exhorter and his
gang of racist gangsters are taking 
advantage of this and are increasing 
their
agitation. You are to get back there 
and take measures to regain our strength
in the community. You'll be given the 
forces you need and you'll report to us
for a strategy meeting about which 
you'll be notified tomorrow. And 
please,"
he emphasized with his gavel, "be on 
time!"
I was so relieved that none of my own 
problems were discussed that
I

didn't

linger

to

ask

if

the

police

had

been

consulted

about

the

disappearance. Something was wrong with 
the whole deal, for Clifton was too
responsible and had too much to gain 
simply to have disappeared. Did it
have any connection with Ras the 
Exhorter? But that seemed unlikely; 
Harlem
was one of our strongest districts, and 
just a month ago when I was shifted
Ras would have been laughed off the 
street had he tried to attack us. If 
only
I hadn't been so careful not to offend 
the committee I would have kept in
closer contact with Clifton and the 
whole Harlem membership. Now it was as
though I had been suddenly awakened 
from a deep sleep.

Chapter 20

I had been away long enough for the 
streets to seem strange. The
uptown rhythms were slower and yet were 
somehow faster; a different tension
was in the hot night air. I made my way 
through the summer crowds, not to
the district but to Barrelhouse's Jolly 
Dollar, a dark hole of a bar and grill
on upper Eighth Avenue, where one of my 
best contacts, Brother Maceo,
could usually be found about this time, 
having his evening's beer.
Looking through the window, I could see 
men in working clothes and
a few rummy women leaning at the bar, 
and down the aisle between the bar
and counter were a couple of men in 
black and blue checked sport shirts
eating barbecue. A cluster of men and 
women hovered near the juke box at
the rear. But when I went in Brother 
Maceo wasn't among them and I
pushed to the bar, deciding to wait 
over a beer.
"Good evening, Brothers," I said, 
finding myself beside two men
whom I had seen around before; only to 
have them look at me oddly, the
eyebrows of the tall one raising at a 
drunken angle as he looked at the other.
"Shit," the tall man said.
"You said it, man; he a relative of 
yourn?"
"Shit, he goddam sho ain't no kin of 
mine!"
I turned and looked at them, the room 
suddenly cloudy.
"He must be drunk," the second man 
said. "Maybe he thinks he's kin
to you."
"Then his whiskey's telling him a damn 
lie. I wouldn't be his kin
even if I was -- Hey, Barrelhouse!"
I moved away, down the bar, looking at 
them out of a feeling of
suspense. They didn't sound drunk and I 
had said nothing to offend, and I
was certain that they knew who I was. 
What was it? The Brotherhood
greeting was as familiar as "Give me 
some skin" or "Peace, it's wonderful."
I saw Barrelhouse rolling down from the 
other end of the bar, his
white apron indented by the tension of 
its cord so that he looked like that
kind of metal beer barrel which has a 
groove around its middle; and seeing
me now, he began to smile.
"Well, I'll be damned if it ain't the 
good brother," he said, stretching
out his hand. "Brother, where you been 
keeping yourself?"
"I've been working downtown," I said, 
feeling a surge of gratitude.
"Fine, fine!" Barrelhouse said.

"Business good?"
"I'd rather not discuss it, Brother. 
Business is bad. Very bad."
"I'm sorry to hear it. You'd better 
give me a beer," I said, "after
you've served these gentlemen." I 
watched them in the mirror.
"Sure thing," Barrelhouse said, 
reaching for a glass and drawing a
beer. "What you putting down, ole man?" 
he said to the tall man.
"Look here, Barrel, we wanted to ask 
you one question," the tall one
said. "We just wanted to know if you 
could tell us just whose brother this
here cat's supposed to be? He come in 
here just now calling everybody
brother."
"He's my brother," Barrel said, holding 
the foaming glass between his
long fingers. "Anything wrong with 
that?"
"Look, fellow," I said down the bar, 
"that's our way of speaking. I
meant no harm in calling you brother. 
I'm sorry you misunderstood me."
"Brother, here's your beer," 
Barrelhouse said.
"So he's your brother, eh, Barrel?"
Barrel's eyes narrowed as he pressed 
his huge chest across the bar,
looking suddenly sad. "You enjoying 
yourself, MacAdams?" he said gloomily.
"You like your beer?"
"Sho," MacAdams said.
"It cold enough?"
"Sho, but Barrel --"
"You like the groovy music on the 
juke?" Barrelhouse said.
"Hell, yes, but --"
"And you like our good, clean, sociable 
atmosphere?"
"Sho, but that ain't what I'm talking 
about," the man said.
"Yeah,

but

that's

what

I'm

talking

about,"

Barrelhouse

said

mournfully. "And if you like it, like 
it, and don't start trying to bug my 
other
customers. This here man's done more 
for the community than you'll ever
do."
"What community?" MacAdams said, 
cutting his eyes around toward
me. "I hear he got the white fever and 
left . . ."
"You liable to hear anything," 
Barrelhouse said. "There's some paper
back there in the gents' room. You 
ought to wipe out your ears."
"Never mind my ears."

"Aw come" on, Mac," his friend said. 
"Forgit it. Ain't the man done
apologized?"
"I said never mind my ears," MacAdams 
said. "You just tell your
brother he ought to be careful 'bout 
who he claims as kinfolks. Some of us
don't think so much of his kind of 
politics."
I looked from one to the other. I 
considered myself beyond the stage
of street-fighting, and one of the 
worst things I could do upon returning 
to
the community was to engage in a brawl. 
I looked at MacAdams and was
glad when the other man pushed him down 
the bar.
"That MacAdams thinks he's right," 
Barrelhouse said. "He's the kind
caint nobody please. Be frank though, 
there's lots feel like that now."
I

shook

my

head

in bafflement. I'd

never met

that

kind

of

antagonism before. "What's happened to 
Brother Maceo?" I said.
"I don't know, Brother. He don't come 
in so regular these days.
Things are kinda changing up here. 
Ain't much money floating around."
"Times are hard everywhere. But what's 
been going on up here,
Barrel?" I said.
"Oh, you know how it is, Brother; 
things are tight and lots of folks
who got jobs through you people have 
lost them. You know how it goes."
"You mean people in our organization?"
"Quite a few of them are. Fellows like 
Brother Maceo."
"But why? They were doing all right."
"Sure they was -- as long as you people 
was fighting for 'em. But the
minute y'all stopped, they started 
throwing folks out on the street."
I looked at him, big and sincere before 
me. It was unbelievable that
the Brotherhood had stopped its work, 
and yet he wasn't lying. "Give me
another beer," I said. Then someone 
called him from the back, and he drew
the beer and left.
I drank it slowly, hoping Brother Maceo 
would appear before I had
finished. When he didn't I waved to 
Barrelhouse and left for the district.
Perhaps Brother Tarp could explain; or 
at least tell me something about
Clifton.
I walked through the dark block over to 
Seventh and started down;
things were beginning to look serious. 
Along the way I saw not a single sign
of Brotherhood activity. In a hot side 
street I came upon a couple striking

matches along the curb, kneeling as 
though looking for a lost coin, the
matches flaring dimly in their faces. 
Then I found myself in a strangely
familiar block and broke out in a 
sweat: I had walked almost to Mary's 
door,
and turned now and hurried away.
Barrelhouse had prepared me for the 
darkened windows of the
district, but not, when I let myself 
in, to call in vain through the dark to
Brother Tarp. I went to the room where 
he slept, but he was not there; then
I went through the dark hall to my old 
office and threw myself into my desk
chair, exhausted. Everything seemed to 
be slipping away from me and I could
find no quick absorbing action that 
would get it under control. I tried to
think of whom among the district 
committee I might call for information
concerning Clifton, but here again I 
was balked. For if I selected one who
believed that I had requested to be 
transferred because I hated my own
people it would only complicate 
matters. No doubt there would be some
who'd resent my return, so it was best 
to confront them all at once without
giving any one of them the opportunity 
to organize any sentiment against me.
It was best that I talk with Brother 
Tarp, whom I trusted. When he came in
he could give me an idea of the state 
of affairs, and perhaps tell me what
had actually happened to Clifton.
But Brother Tarp didn't arrive. I went 
out and got a container of
coffee and returned to spend the night 
poring over the district's records.
When he hadn't returned by three A.M. I 
went to his room and took a look
around. It was empty, even the bed was 
gone. I'm all alone, I thought. A lot
has occurred about which I wasn't told; 
something that had not only stifled
the members' interest but which, 
according to the records, had sent them
away in droves. Barrelhouse had said 
that the organization had quit fighting,
and that was the only explanation I 
could find for Brother Tarp's leaving.
Unless, of course, he'd had 
disagreements with Clifton or some of 
the other
leaders. And now returning to my desk I 
noticed his gift of Douglass' portrait
was gone. I felt in my pocket for the 
leg chain, at least I hadn't forgotten 
to
take that along. I pushed the records 
aside; they told me nothing of why
things were as they were. Picking up 
the telephone I called Clifton's number,
hearing it ring on and on. Finally I 
gave it up and went to sleep in my
chair. Everything had to wait until the 
strategy meeting. Returning to the
district was like returning to a city 
of the dead.

Somewhat to my surprise there were a 
good number of members in
the hall when I awoke, and having no 
directives from the committee on how
to proceed I organized them into teams 
to search for Brother Clifton. Not one
could give me any definite information. 
Brother Clifton had appeared at the
district as usual up to the time of his 
disappearance. There had been no
quarrels with committee members, and he 
was as popular as ever. Nor had
there been any clashes with Ras the 
Exhorter -- although in the past week he
had been increasingly active. As for 
the loss of membership and influence, it
was a result of a new program which had 
called for the shelving of our old
techniques of agitation. There had 
been, to my surprise, a switch in 
emphasis
from local issues to those more 
national and international in scope, 
and it
was felt that for the moment the 
interests of Harlem were not of first
importance. I didn't know what to make 
of it, since there had been no such
change of program downtown. Clifton was 
forgotten, everything which I was
to do now seemed to depend upon getting 
an explanation from the
committee, and I waited with growing 
agitation to be called to the strategy
meeting.
Such meetings were usually held around 
one o'clock and we were
notified well ahead. But by 
eleven-thirty I had received no word 
and I
became worried. By twelve an uneasy 
sense of isolation took hold of me.
Something was cooking, but what, how, 
why? Finally I phoned headquarters,
but could reach none of the leaders. 
What is this, I wondered; then I called
the leaders of other districts with the 
same results. And now I was certain
that the meeting was being held. But 
why without me? Had they investigated
Wrestrum's

charges

and

decided

they

were

true?

It

seemed

that

the

membership had fallen off after I had 
gone downtown. Or was it the woman?
Whatever it was, now was not the time 
to leave me out of a meeting; things
were too urgent in the district. I 
hurried down to headquarters.
When I arrived the meeting was in 
session, just as I expected, and
word had been left that it was not to 
be disturbed by anyone. It was obvious
that they hadn't forgotten to notify 
me. I left the building in a rage. Very
well, I thought, when they do decide to 
call me they'll have to find me. I
should never have been shifted in the 
first place, and now that I was sent
back to clean up the mess they should 
aid me as quickly as possible. I would
do no more running downtown, nor would 
I accept any program that they

sent up without consulting the Harlem 
committee. Then I decided, of all
things, to shop for a pair of new 
shoes, and walked over to Fifth Avenue.
It was hot, the walks still filled with 
noontime crowds moving with
reluctance back to their jobs. I moved 
along close to the curb to avoid the
bumping and agitated changes of pace, 
the chattering women in summer
dresses, finally entering the 
leather-smelling, air-cooled interior 
of the shoe
store with a sense of relief.
My feet felt light in the new summer 
shoes as I went back into the
blazing heat, and I recalled the old 
boyhood pleasure of discarding winter
shoes for sneakers and the neighborhood 
foot races that always followed, that
light-footed, speedy, floating 
sensation. Well, I thought, you've run 
your last
foot race and you'd better get back to 
the district in case you're called. I
hurried now, my feet feeling trim and 
light as I moved through the oncoming
rush of sunbeaten faces. To avoid the 
crowd on Forty-second Street I turned
off at Forty-third and it was here that 
things began to boil.
A small fruit wagon with an array of 
bright peaches and pears stood
near the curb, and the vendor, a florid 
man with bulbous nose and bright
black

Italian

eyes,

looked

at

me

knowingly

from

beneath

his

huge

white-and-orange umbrella then over 
toward a crowd that had formed
alongside the building across the 
street. What's wrong with him? I 
thought.
Then I was across the street and 
passing the group standing with their 
backs
to me. A clipped, insinuating voice 
spieled words whose meaning I couldn't
catch and I was about to pass on when I 
saw the boy. He was a slender
brown fellow whom I recognized 
immediately as a close friend of 
Clifton's,
and who now was looking intently across 
the tops of cars to where down the
block near the post office on the other 
side a tall policeman was approaching.
Perhaps he'll know something, I 
thought, as he looked around to see me 
and
stopped in confusion.
"Hello, there," I began, and when he 
turned toward the crowd and
whistled I didn't know whether he was 
telling me to do the same or
signalling to someone else. I swung 
around, seeing him step to where a large
carton sat beside the building and 
sling its canvas straps to his shoulder 
as
once more he looked toward the 
policeman, ignoring me. Puzzled, I moved
into the crowd and pressed to the front 
where at my feet I saw a square
piece of cardboard upon which something 
was moving with furious action. It

was some kind of toy and I glanced at 
the crowd's fascinated eyes and down
again, seeing it clearly this time. I'd 
seen nothing like it before. A grinning
doll of orange-and-black tissue paper 
with thin flat cardboard disks forming
its head and feet and which some 
mysterious mechanism was causing to
move up and down in a loose-jointed, 
shoulder-shaking, infuriatingly sensuous
motion, a dance that was completely 
detached from the black, mask-like face.
It's no jumping-jack, but what, I 
thought, seeing the doll throwing 
itself about
with the fierce defiance of someone 
performing a degrading act in public,
dancing as though it received a 
perverse pleasure from its motions. And
beneath the chuckles of the crowd I 
could hear the swishing of its ruffled
paper, while the same 
out-of-the-corner-of-the-mouth voice 
continued to spiel:
Shake it up! Shake it up!
He's Sambo, the dancing doll, ladies 
and gentlemen.
Shake him, stretch him by the neck and 
set him down,
-- He'll do the rest. Yes!
He'll make you laugh, he'll make you 
sigh, si-igh.
He'll make you want to dance, and dance 
-Here you are, ladies and gentlemen, 
Sambo,
The dancing doll.
Buy one for your baby. Take him to your 
girl friend and she'll love
you, loove you!
He'll keep you entertained. He'll make 
you weep sweet -Tears from laughing.
Shake him, shake him, you cannot break 
him
For he's Sambo, the dancing, Sambo, the 
prancing,
Sambo, the entrancing, Sambo Boogie 
Woogie paper doll.
And all for twenty-five cents, the 
quarter part of a dollar . . .
Ladies and gentlemen, he'll bring you 
joy, step up and meet him,
Sambo the -I knew I should get back to 
the district but I was held by the
inanimate, boneless bouncing of the 
grinning doll and struggled between the
desire to join in the laughter and to 
leap upon it with both feet, when it

suddenly collapsed and I saw the tip of 
the spieler's toe press upon the
circular cardboard that formed the feet 
and a broad black hand come down,
its fingers deftly lifting the doll's 
head and stretching it upward, twice its
length, then releasing it to dance 
again. And suddenly the voice didn't go
with the hand. It was as though I had 
waded out into a shallow pool only to
have the bottom drop out and the water 
close over my head. I looked up.
"Not you . . ." I began. But his eyes 
looked past me deliberately
unseeing. I was paralyzed, looking at 
him, knowing I wasn't dreaming,
hearing:
What makes him happy, what makes him 
dance,
This Sambo, this jambo, this 
high-stepping joy boy?
He's more than a toy, ladies and 
gentlemen, he's Sambo, the dancing
doll, the twentieth-century miracle.
Look at that rumba, that suzy-q, he's 
Sambo-Boogie,
Sambo-Woogie, you don't have to feed 
him, he sleeps collapsed, he'll
kill your depression
And your dispossession, he lives upon 
the sunshine of your lordly
smile
And only twenty-five cents, the 
brotherly two bits of a dollar because
he wants me to eat.
It gives him pleasure to see me eat.
You simply take him and shake him . . . 
and he does the rest.
Thank you, lady . . .
It was Clifton, riding easily back and 
forth on his knees, flexing his
legs without shifting his feet, his 
right shoulder raised at an angle and 
his
arm pointing stiffly at the bouncing 
doll as he spieled from the corner of 
his
mouth.
The whistle came again, and I saw him 
glance quickly toward his
lookout, the boy with the carton.
"Who else wants little Sambo before we 
take it on the lambo? Speak
up, ladies and gentlemen, who wants 
little . . . ?"
And again the whistle. "Who wants 
Sambo, the dancing, prancing?
Hurry, hurry, ladies and gentlemen. 
There's no license for little Sambo, the

joy spreader. You can't tax joy, so 
speak up, ladies and gentlemen . . ."
For a second our eyes met and he gave 
me a contemptuous smile,
then he spieled again. I felt betrayed. 
I looked at the doll and felt my throat
constrict. The rage welled behind the 
phlegm as I rocked back on my heels
and crouched forward. There was a flash 
of whiteness and a splatter like
heavy rain striking a newspaper and I 
saw the doll go over backwards, wilting
into a dripping rag of frilled tissue, 
the hateful head upturned on its
outstretched neck still grinning toward 
the sky. The crowd turned on me
indignantly. The whistle came again. I 
saw a short pot-bellied man look
down, then up at me with amazement and 
explode with laughter, pointing
from me to the doll, rocking. People 
backed away from me. I saw Clifton step
close to the building where beside the 
fellow with the carton I now saw a
whole chorus-line of dolls flouncing 
themselves with a perverse increase of
energy and the crowd laughing 
hysterically.
"You, you!" I began, only to see him 
pick up two of the dolls and
step forward. But now the lookout came 
close. "He's coming," he said,
nodding toward the approaching 
policeman as he swept up the dolls, 
dropping
them into the carton and starting away.
"Follow little Sambo around the corner, 
ladies and gentlemen," Clifton
called. "There's a great show coming up 
. . ."
It happened so fast that in a second 
only I and an old lady in a
blue polka-dot dress were left. She 
looked at me then back to the walk,
smiling. I saw one of the dolls. I 
looked. She was still smiling and I 
raised
my foot to crush it, hearing her cry, 
"Oh, no!" The policeman was just
opposite and I reached down instead, 
picking it up and walking off in the
same motion. I examined it, strangely 
weightless in my hand, half expecting
to feel it pulse with life. It was a 
still frill of paper. I dropped it in 
the
pocket where I carried Brother Tarp's 
chain link and started after the
vanished crowd. But I couldn't face 
Clifton again. I didn't want to see 
him. I
might forget myself and attack him. I 
went in the other direction, toward
Sixth Avenue, past the policeman. What 
a way to find him, I thought. What
had happened to Clifton? It was all so 
wrong, so unexpected. How on earth
could he drop from Brotherhood to this 
in so short a time? And why if he
had to fall back did he try to carry 
the whole structure with him? What
would non-members who knew him say? It 
was as though he had chosen --

how had he put it the night he fought 
with Ras? -- to fall outside of history.
I stopped in the middle of the walk 
with the thought. "To plunge," he had
said. But he knew that only in the 
Brotherhood could we make ourselves
known, could we avoid being empty Sambo 
dolls. Such an obscene flouncing
of everything human! My God! And I had 
been worrying about being left out
of a meeting! I'd overlook it a 
thousand times; no matter why I wasn't 
called.
I'd forget it and hold on desperately 
to Brotherhood with all my strength. For
to break away would be to plunge . . . 
To plunge! And those dolls, where
had they found them? Why had he picked 
that way to earn a quarter? Why
not sell apples or song sheets, or 
shine shoes?
I wandered past the subway and 
continued around the corner to
Forty-second Street, my mind grappling 
for meaning. And when I came
around the corner onto the crowded walk 
into the sun, they were already
lining the curb and shading their faces 
with their hands. I saw the traffic
moving with the lights, and across the 
street a few pedestrians were looking
back toward the center of the block 
where the trees of Bryant Park rose
above two men. I saw a flight of 
pigeons whirl out of the trees and it 
all
happened in the swift interval of their 
circling, very abruptly and in the noise
of the traffic -- yet seeming to unfold 
in my mind like a slow-motion movie
run off with the sound track dead.
At first I thought it was a cop and a 
shoeshine boy; then there was
a break in the traffic and across the 
sun-glaring bands of trolley rails I
recognized Clifton. His partner had 
disappeared now and Clifton had the box
slung to his left shoulder with the cop 
moving slowly behind and to one side
of him. They were coming my way, 
passing a newsstand, and I saw the rails
in the asphalt and a fire plug at the 
curb and the flying birds, and thought,
You'll have to follow and pay his fine 
. . . just as the cop pushed him, 
jolting
him forward and Clifton trying to keep 
the box from swinging against his leg
and saying something over his shoulder 
and going forward as one of the
pigeons swung down into the street and 
up again, leaving a feather floating
white in the dazzling backlight of the 
sun, and I could see the cop push
Clifton again, stepping solidly forward 
in his black shirt, his arm shooting out
stiffly, sending him in a head-snapping 
forward stumble until he caught
himself, saying something over his 
shoulder again, the two moving in a kind
of march that I'd seen many times, but 
never with anyone like Clifton. And I

could see the cop bark a command and 
lunge forward, thrusting out his arm
and missing, thrown off balance as 
suddenly Clifton spun on his toes like a
dancer and swung his right arm over and 
around in a short, jolting arc, his
torso carrying forward and to the left 
in a motion that sent the box strap
free as his right foot traveled forward 
and his left arm followed through in a
floating uppercut that sent the cop's 
cap sailing into the street and his feet
flying, to drop him hard, rocking from 
left to right on the walk as Clifton
kicked the box thudding aside and 
crouched, his left foot forward, his 
hands
high, waiting. And between the flashing 
of cars I could see the cop propping
himself on his elbows like a drunk 
trying to get his head up, shaking it 
and
thrusting it forward -- And somewhere 
between the dull roar of traffic and
the subway vibrating underground I 
heard rapid explosions and saw each
pigeon diving wildly as though 
blackjacked by the sound, and the cop 
sitting
up straight now, and rising to his 
knees looking steadily at Clifton, and 
the
pigeons plummeting swiftly into the 
trees, and Clifton still facing the cop 
and
suddenly crumpling.
He fell forward on his knees, like a 
man saying his prayers just as a
heavy-set man in a hat with a 
turned-down brim stepped from around the
newsstand and yelled a protest. I 
couldn't move. The sun seemed to scream
an inch above my head. Someone shouted. 
A few men were starting into the
street. The cop was standing now and 
looking down at Clifton as though
surprised, the gun in his hand. I took 
a few steps forward, walking blindly
now, unthinking, yet my mind 
registering it all vividly. Across and 
starting up
on the curb, and seeing Clifton up 
closer now, lying in the same position, 
on
his side, a huge wetness growing on his 
shirt, and I couldn't set my foot
down. Cars sailed close behind me, but 
1 couldn't take the step that would
raise me up to the walk. I stood there, 
one leg in the street and the other
raised above the curb, hearing whistles 
screeching and looked toward the
library to see two cops coming on in a 
lunging, big-bellied run. I looked back
to Clifton, the cop was waving me away 
with his gun, sounding like a boy
with a changing voice.
"Get back on the other side," he said. 
He was the cop that I'd
passed on Forty-third a few minutes 
before. My mouth was dry.
"He's a friend of mine, I want to help 
. . ." I said, finally stepping
upon the curb.

"He don't need no help, Junior. Get 
across that street!"
The cop's hair hung on the sides of his 
face, his uniform was dirty,
and I watched him without emotion, 
hesitated, hearing the sound of 
footfalls
approaching. Everything seemed slowed 
down. A pool formed slowly on the
walk. My eyes blurred. I raised my 
head. The cop looked at me curiously.
Above in the park I could hear the 
furious flapping of wings; on my neck,
the pressure of eyes. I turned. A 
round-headed, apple-cheeked boy with a
thickly freckled nose and Slavic eyes 
leaned over the fence of the park above,
and now as he saw me turn, he shrilled 
something to someone behind him,
his face lighting up with ecstasy . . . 
What does it mean, I wondered, turning
back to that to which I did not wish to 
turn.
There were three cops now, one watching 
the crowd and the others
looking at Clifton. The first cop had 
his cap on again.
"Look, Junior," he said very clearly, 
"I had enough trouble for today
-- you going to get on across that 
street?"
I opened my mouth but nothing would 
come. Kneeling, one of the
cops was examining Clifton and making 
notes on a pad.
"I'm his friend," I said, and the one 
making notes looked up.
"He's a cooked pigeon, Mac," he said. 
"You ain't got any friend any
more."
I looked at him.
"Hey, Mickey," the boy above us called, 
"the guy's out cold!"
I looked down. "That's right," the 
kneeling cop said. "What's your
name?"
I told him. I answered his questions 
about Clifton as best I could
until the wagon came. For once it came 
quickly. I watched numbly as they
moved him inside, placing the box of 
dolls in with him. Across the street the
crowd still churned. Then the wagon was 
gone and I started back toward the
subway.
"Say, mister," the boy's voice shrilled 
down. "Your friend sure knows
how to use his dukes. Biff, bang! One, 
two, and the cop's on his ass!"
I bowed my head to this final tribute, 
and now walking away in the
sun I tried to erase the scene from my 
mind.

I WANDERED down the subway stairs 
seeing nothing, my mind
plunging. The subway was cool and I 
leaned against a pillar, hearing the 
roar
of trains passing across on the other 
side, feeling the rushing roar of air.
Why should a man deliberately plunge 
outside of history and peddle an
obscenity, my mind went on 
abstractedly. Why should he choose to 
disarm
himself, give up his voice and leave 
the only organization offering him a
chance to "define" himself? The 
platform vibrated and I looked down. 
Bits of
paper whirled up in the passage of air, 
settling quickly as a train moved past.
Why had he turned away? Why had he 
chosen to step off the platform and
fall beneath the train? Why did he 
choose to plunge into nothingness, into
the void of faceless faces, of 
soundless voices, lying outside 
history? I tried to
step away and look at it from a 
distance of words read in books,
half-remembered. For history records 
the patterns of men's lives, they say:
Who slept with whom and with what 
results; who fought and who won and
who lived to lie about it afterwards. 
All things, it is said, are duly 
recorded -all things of importance, 
that is. But not quite, for actually it 
is only the
known, the seen, the heard and only 
those events that the recorder regards 
as
important that are put down, those lies 
his keepers keep their power by. But
the cop would

be Clifton's historian, his

judge, his

witness, and his

executioner, and I was the only brother 
in the watching crowd. And I, the
only witness for the defense, knew 
neither the extent of his guilt nor the
nature of his crime. Where were the 
historians today? And how would they
put it down?
I stood there with the trains plunging 
in and out, throwing blue
sparks. What did they ever think of us 
transitory ones? Ones such as I had
been before I found Brotherhood -- 
birds of passage who were too obscure
for learned classification, too silent 
for the most sensitive recorders of 
sound;
of natures too ambiguous for the most 
ambiguous words, and too distant
from the centers of historical decision 
to sign or even to applaud the signers
of historical documents? We who write 
no novels, histories or other books.
What about us, I thought, seeing 
Clifton again in my mind and going to 
sit
upon a bench as a cool gust of air 
rolled up the tunnel.
A body of people came down the 
platform, some of them Negroes.
Yes, I thought, what about those of us 
who shoot up from the South into the
busy city like wild jacks-in-the-box 
broken loose from our springs -- so

sudden that our gait becomes like that 
of deep-sea divers suffering from the
bends? What about those fellows waiting 
still and silent there on the
platform, so still and silent that they 
clash with the crowd in their very
immobility; standing noisy in their 
very silence; harsh as a cry of terror 
in
their quietness? What about those three 
boys, coming now along the platform,
tall and slender, walking stiffly with 
swinging shoulders in their 
well-pressed,
too-hot-for-summer suits, their collars 
high and tight about their necks, their
identical hats of black cheap felt set 
upon the crowns of their heads with a
severe formality above their hard 
conked hair? It was as though I'd never
seen their like before: Walking slowly, 
their shoulders swaying, their legs
swinging from their hips in trousers 
that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting
snug about their ankles; their coats 
long and hip-tight with shoulders far 
too
broad to be those of natural western 
men. These fellows whose bodies seemed
-- what had one of my teachers said of 
me? -- "You're like one of these
African sculptures, distorted in the 
interest of a design." Well, what design
and whose?
I stared as they seemed to move like 
dancers in some kind of funeral
ceremony, swaying, going forward, their 
black faces secret, moving slowly
down the subway platform, the heavy 
heel-plated shoes making a rhythmical
tapping as they moved. Everyone must 
have seen them, or heard their muted
laughter, or smelled the heavy pomade 
on their hair -- or perhaps failed to
see them at all. For they were men 
outside of historical time, they were
untouched, they didn't believe in 
Brotherhood, no doubt had never heard of
it; or perhaps like Clifton would 
mysteriously have rejected its 
mysteries; men
of transition whose faces were immobile.
I got up and went behind them. Women 
shoppers with bundles and
impatient men in straw hats and 
seersucker suits stood along the 
platform as
they passed. And suddenly I found 
myself thinking, Do they come to bury 
the
others or to be entombed, to give life 
or to receive it? Do the others see
them, think about them, even those 
standing close enough to speak? And if
they spoke back, would the impatient 
businessmen in conventional suits and
tired housewives with their plunder, 
understand? What would they say? For
the boys speak a jived-up transitional 
language full of country glamour, think
transitional thoughts, though perhaps 
they dream the same old ancient
dreams. They were men out of time -- 
unless they found Brotherhood. Men

out of time, who would soon be gone and 
forgotten . . . But who knew (and
now I began to tremble so violently I 
had to lean against a refuse can) -who 
knew but that they were the saviors, 
the true leaders, the bearers of
something precious? The stewards of 
something uncomfortable, burdensome,
which they hated because, living 
outside the realm of history, there was 
no
one to applaud their value and they 
themselves failed to understand it. What
if Brother Jack were wrong? What if 
history was a gambler, instead of a 
force
in a laboratory experiment, and the 
boys his ace in the hole? What if 
history
was not a reasonable citizen, but a 
madman full of paranoid guile and these
boys his agents, his big surprise! His 
own revenge? For they were outside, in
the dark with Sambo, the dancing paper 
doll; taking it on the lambo with my
fallen brother, Tod Clifton (Tod, Tod) 
running and dodging the forces of
history instead of making a dominating 
stand.
A train came. I followed them inside. 
There were many seats and the
three sat together. I stood, holding 
onto the center pole, looking down the
length of the car. On one side I saw a 
white nun in black telling her beads,
and standing before the door across the 
aisle there was another dressed
completely in white, the exact 
duplicate of the other except that she 
was
black and her black feet bare. Neither 
of the nuns was looking at the other
but at their crucifixes, and suddenly I 
laughed and a verse I'd heard long ago
at the Golden Day paraphrased itself in 
my mind:
Bread and Wine,
Bread and Wine,
Your cross ain't nearly so
Heavy as mine . . .
And the nuns rode on with lowered heads.
I looked at the boys. They sat as 
formally as they walked. From time
to time one of them would look at his 
reflection in the window and give his
hat brim a snap, the others watching 
him silently, communicating ironically
with their eyes, then looking straight 
ahead. I staggered with the lunging of
the train, feeling the overhead fans 
driving the hot air down upon me. What
was I in relation to the boys, I 
wondered. Perhaps an accident, like 
Douglass.
Perhaps each hundred years or so men 
like them, like me, appeared in

society, drifting through; and yet by 
all historical logic we, I, should have
disappeared around the first part of 
the nineteenth century, rationalized 
out of
existence. Perhaps, like them, I was a 
throwback, a small distant meteorite
that died several hundred years ago and 
now lived only by virtue of the light
that speeds through space at too great 
a pace to realize that its source has
become a piece of lead . . . This was 
silly, such thoughts. I looked at the
boys; one tapped another on the knee, 
and I saw him remove three rolled
magazines from an inner pocket, passing 
two around and keeping one for
himself. The others took theirs 
silently and began to read in complete
absorption. One held his magazine high 
before his face and for an instant I
saw a vivid scene: The shining rails, 
the fire hydrant, the fallen policeman,
the diving birds and in the mid-ground, 
Clifton, crumpling. Then I saw the
cover of a comic book and thought, 
Clifton would have known them better
than I. He knew them all the time. I 
studied them closely until they left the
train, their shoulders rocking, their 
heavy heel plates clicking remote, 
cryptic
messages in the brief silence of the 
train's stop.
I came out of the subway, weak, moving 
through the heat as though
I carried a heavy stone, the weight of 
a mountain on my shoulders. My new
shoes hurt my feet. Now, moving through 
the crowds along 125th Street, I
was painfully aware of other men 
dressed like the boys, and of girls in 
dark
exotic-colored stockings, their 
costumes surreal variations of downtown 
styles.
They'd been there all along, but 
somehow I'd missed them. I'd missed them
even when my work had been most 
successful. They were outside the groove
of history, and it was my job to get 
them in, all of them. I looked into the
design of their faces, hardly a one 
that was unlike someone I'd known down
South. Forgotten names sang through my 
head like forgotten scenes in
dreams. I moved with the crowd, the 
sweat pouring off me, listening to the
grinding roar of traffic, the growing 
sound of a record shop loudspeaker
blaring a languid blues. I stopped. Was 
this all that would be recorded? Was
this the only true history of the 
times, a mood blared by trumpets,
trombones, saxophones and drums, a song 
with turgid, inadequate words? My
mind flowed. It was as though in this 
short block I was forced to walk past
everyone I'd ever known and no one 
would smile or call my name. No one
fixed me in his eyes. I walked in 
feverish isolation. Near the corner now 
a
couple of boys darted out of the Five 
and Ten with handfuls of candy bars,

dropping them along the walks as they 
ran with a man right behind. They
came toward me, pumping past, and I 
killed an impulse to trip the man and
was confused all the more when an old 
woman standing further along threw
out her leg and swung a heavy bag. The 
man went down, sliding across the
walk as she shook her head in triumph. 
A pressure of guilt came over me. I
stood on the edge of the walk watching 
the crowd threatening to attack the
man until a policeman appeared and 
dispersed them. And although I knew no
one man could do much about it, I felt 
responsible. All our work had been
very little, no great change had been 
made. And it was all my fault. I'd been
so fascinated by the motion that I'd 
forgotten to measure what it was
bringing forth. I'd been asleep, 
dreaming.

Chapter 21
When I got back to the district a small 
group of youth members
stopped their joking to welcome me, but 
I couldn't break the news. I went
through to the office with only a nod, 
shutting the door upon their voices
and sat staring out through the trees. 
The once fresh green of the trees was
dark and drying now and somewhere down 
below a clothesline peddler
clanged his bell and called. Then, as I 
fought against it, the scene came back
-- not of the death, but of the dolls. 
Why had I lost my head and spat upon
the doll, I wondered. What had Clifton 
felt when he saw me? He must have
hated me behind his spiel, yet he'd 
ignored me. Yes, and been amused by my
political stupidity. I had blown up and 
acted personally instead of denouncing
the significance of the dolls, him, the 
obscene idea, and

seizing the

opportunity to educate the crowd. We 
lost no opportunity to educate, and I
had failed. All I'd done was to make 
them laugh all the louder . . . I had
aided and abetted social backwardness . 
. . The scene changed -- he lay in
the sun and this time I saw a trail of 
smoke left by a sky-writing plane
lingering in the sky, a large woman in 
a kelly-green dress stood near me
saying, "Oh, Oh!" . . .

I turned and faced the map, removing 
the doll from my pocket and
tossing it upon the desk. My stomach 
surged. To die for such a thing! I
picked it up with an unclean feeling, 
looked at the frilled paper. The joined
cardboard feet hung down, pulling the 
paper legs in elastic folds, a
construction of tissue, cardboard and 
glue. And yet I felt a hatred as for
something alive. What had made it seem 
to dance? Its cardboard hands were
doubled into fists, the fingers 
outlined in orange paint, and I noticed 
that it
had two faces, one on either side of 
the disk of cardboard, and both 
grinning.
Clifton's voice came to me as he 
spieled his directions for making it 
dance,
and I held it by the feet and stretched 
its neck, seeing it crumple and slide
forward. I tried again, turning its 
other face around. It gave a tired 
bounce,
shook itself and fell in a heap.
"Go on, entertain me," I said, giving 
it a stretch. "You entertained
the crowd." I turned it around. One 
face grinned as broadly as the other. It
had grinned back at Clifton as it 
grinned forward at the crowd, and their
entertainment had been his death. It 
had still grinned when I played the tool
and spat upon it, and it was still 
grinning when Clifton ignored me. Then I
saw a fine black thread and pulled it 
from the trilled paper. There was a
loop tied in the end. I slipped it over 
my finger and stood stretching it taut.
And this time it danced. Clifton had 
been making it dance all the time and
the black thread had been invisible.
Why didn't you hit him? I asked myself; 
try to break his jaw? Why
didn't you hurt him and save him? You 
might have started a fight and both
of you would have been arrested with no 
shooting . . . But why had he
resisted the cop anyway? He'd been 
arrested before; he knew how far to go
with a cop. What had the cop said to 
make him angry enough to lose his
head? And suddenly it occurred to me 
that he might have been angry before
he resisted, before he'd even seen the 
cop. My breath became short; I felt
myself go weak. What if he believed I'd 
sold out? It was a sickening thought.
I sat holding myself as though I might 
break. For a moment I weighed the
idea, but it was too big for me. I 
could only accept responsibility for the
living, not for the dead. My mind 
backed away from the notion. The 
incident
was political. I looked at the doll, 
thinking, The political equivalent of 
such
entertainment is death. But that's too 
broad a definition. Its economic
meaning? That the lite of a man is 
worth the sale of a two-bit paper doll 
. .

. But that didn't kill the idea that my 
anger helped speed him on to death.
And still my mind fought against it. 
For what had I to do with the crisis 
that
had broken his integrity? What had I to 
do with his selling the dolls in the
first place? And finally I had to give 
that up too. I was no detective, and,
politically, individuals were without 
meaning. The shooting was all that was
left of him now, Clifton had chosen to 
plunge out of history and, except for
the picture it made in my mind's eye, 
only the plunge was recorded, and that
was the only important thing.
I sat rigid, as though waiting to hear 
the explosions again, fighting
against the weight that seemed to pull 
me down. I heard the clothesline
peddler's bell . . . What would I tell 
the committee when the newspaper
accounts were out? To hell with them. 
How would I explain the dolls? But
why should I say anything? What could 
we do to fight back. That was my
worry. The bell tolled again in the 
yard below. I looked at the doll. I 
could
think of no justification for Clifton's 
having sold the dolls, but there was
justification enough for giving him a 
public funeral, and I seized upon the
idea now as though it would save my 
life. Even though I wanted to turn
away from it as I'd wanted to turn from 
Clifton's crumpled body on the walk.
But the odds against us were too great 
for such weakness. We had to use
every politically effective weapon 
against them; Clifton understood that. 
He
had to be buried and I knew of no 
relatives; someone had to see that he 
was
placed in the ground. Yes, the dolls 
were obscene and his act a betrayal. But
he was only a salesman, not the 
inventor, and it was necessary that we 
make
it known that the meaning of his death 
was greater than the incident or the
object that caused it. Both as a means 
of avenging him and of preventing
other such deaths . . . yes, and of 
attracting lost members back into the
ranks. It would be ruthless, but a 
ruthlessness in the interest of 
Brotherhood,
for we had only our minds and bodies, 
as against the other side's vast power.
We had to make the most of what we had. 
For they had the power to use a
paper doll, first to destroy his 
integrity and then as an excuse for 
killing him.
All right, so we'll use his funeral to 
put his integrity together again . . . 
For
that's all that he had had or wanted. 
And now I could see the doll only
vaguely and drops of moisture were 
thudding down upon its absorbent paper
. . .
I was bent over, staring, when the 
knock came at the door and I

jumped as at a shot, sweeping the doll 
into my pocket, and hastily wiping my
eyes.
"Come in," I said.
The door opened slowly. A group of 
youth members crowded forward,
their faces a question. The girls were 
crying.
"Is it true?" they said.
"That he is dead? Yes," I said, looking 
among them. "Yes."
"But why . . . ?"
"It was a case of provocation and 
murder!" I said, my emotions
beginning to turn to anger.
They stood there, their faces 
questioning me.
"He's dead," a girl said, her voice 
without conviction. "Dead."
"But what do they mean about his 
selling dolls?" a tall youth said.
"I don't know," I said. "I only know 
that he was shot down.
Unarmed. I know how you feel, I saw him 
fall."
"Take me home," a girl screamed. "Take 
me home!"
I stepped forward and caught her, a 
little brown thing in bobby
socks, holding her against me. "No, we 
can't go home," I said, "none of us.
We've got to fight. I'd like to get out 
into the air and forget it, if I ever
could. What we want is not tears but 
anger. We must remember now that we
are fighters, and in such incidents we 
must see the meaning of our struggle.
We must strike back. I want each of you 
to round up all the members you
can. We've got to make our reply."
One of the girls was still crying 
piteously when they went out, but
they were moving quickly.
"Come on, Shirley," they said, taking 
the girl from my shoulder.
I tried to get in touch with 
headquarters, but again I was unable to
reach anyone. I called the Chthonian 
but there was no answer. So I called a
committee of the district's leading 
members and we moved slowly ahead on
our own. I tried to find the youth who 
was with Clifton, but he had
disappeared. Members were set on the 
streets with cans to solicit funds for
his burial. A committee of three old 
women went to the morgue to claim his
body.

We

distributed

black-bordered

leaflets,

denouncing

the

police

commissioner. Preachers were notified 
to have their congregations send letters
of protest to the mayor. The story 
spread. A photograph of Clifton was sent

to the Negro papers and published. 
People were stirred and angry. Street
meetings were organized. And, released 
(by the action) from my indecision, I
threw everything I had into organizing 
the funeral, though moving in a kind
of numb suspension. I didn't go to bed 
for two days and nights, but caught
catnaps at my desk. I ate very little.

THE funeral was arranged to attract the 
largest number. Instead of
holding it in a church or chapel, we 
selected Mount Morris Park, and an
appeal went out for all former members 
to join the funeral march.
It took place on a Saturday, in the 
heat of the afternoon. There was
a thin overcast of clouds, and hundreds 
of people formed for the procession.
I went around giving orders and 
encouragement in a feverish daze, and 
yet
seeming to observe it all from off to 
one side. Brothers and sisters turned up
whom I hadn't seen since my return. And 
members from downtown and
outlying districts. I watched them with 
surprise as they gathered and
wondered at the depths of their sorrow 
as the lines began to form.
There

were

half-draped

flags

and

black

banners.

There

were

black-bordered signs that read:
BROTHER TOD CLIFTON
OUR HOPE SHOT DOWN
There was a hired drum corps with 
crape-draped drums. There was a
band of thirty pieces. There were no 
cars and very few flowers.
It was a slow procession and the band 
played sad, romantic, military
marches. And when the band was silent 
the drum corps beat the time on
drums with muffled heads. It was hot 
and explosive, and delivery men
avoided the district and the police 
details were increased in number. And up
and down the streets people looked out 
of their apartment windows and men
and boys stood on the roofs in the 
thin-veiled sun. I marched at the head
with the old community leaders. It was 
a slow march and as I looked back
from time to time I could see young 
zoot-suiters, hep cats, and men in
overalls and pool-hall gamblers 
stepping into the procession. Men came 
out of
barber shops with lathered faces, their 
neckcloths hanging, to watch and

comment in hushed voices. And I 
wondered, Are they all Clifton's 
friends, or
is it just for the spectacle, the 
slow-paced music? A hot wind blew from
behind me, bringing the sick sweetish 
odor, like the smell of some female
dogs in season.
I looked back. The sun shone down on a 
mass of unbared heads,
and above flags and banners and shining 
horns I could see the cheap gray
coffin moving high upon the shoulders 
of Clifton's tallest companions, who
from time to time shifted it smoothly 
on to others. They bore him high and
they bore him proudly and there was an 
angry sadness in their eyes. The
coffin floated like a heavily loaded 
ship in a channel, winding its way 
slowly
above the bowed and submerged heads. I 
could hear the steady rolling of the
drums with muffled snares, and all 
other sounds were suspended in silence.
Behind, the tramp of feet; ahead, the 
crowds lining the curbs for blocks.
There were tears and muffled sobs and 
many hard, red eyes. We moved
ahead.
We wound through the poorest streets at 
first, a black image of
sorrow, then turned into Seventh Avenue 
and down and over to Lenox. Then
I hurried with the leading brothers to 
the park in a cab. A brother in the
Park Department had opened the lookout 
tower, and a crude platform of
planks and ranked saw horses had been 
erected beneath the black iron bell,
and when the procession started into 
the park we were standing high above,
waiting. At our signal he struck the 
bell, and I could feel my eardrums
throbbing with the old, hollow, 
gut-vibrant Doom-Dong-Doom.
Looking down, I could see them winding 
upward in a mass to the
muffled sound of the drums. Children 
stopped their playing on the grass to
stare, and nurses at the nearby 
hospital came out on the roof to watch, 
their
white uniforms glowing in the now 
unveiled sun like lilies. And crowds
approached the park from all 
directions. The muffled drums now 
beating, now
steadily rolling, spread a dead silence 
upon the air, a prayer tor the unknown
soldier. And looking down I felt a 
lostness. Why were they here? Why had
they found us? Because they knew 
Clifton? Or for the occasion his death 
gave
them to express their protestations, a 
time and place to come together, to
stand touching and sweating and 
breathing and looking in a common
direction? Was either explanation 
adequate in itself? Did it signify love 
or
politicalized hate? And could politics 
ever be an expression of love?

Over the park the silence spread from 
the slow muffled rolling of the
drums, the crunching of footsteps on 
the walks. Then somewhere in the
procession an old, plaintive, masculine 
voice arose in a song, wavering,
stumbling in the silence at first 
alone, until in the band a euphonium 
horn
fumbled for the key and took up the 
air, one catching and rising above the
other and the other pursuing, two black 
pigeons rising above a skull-white
barn to tumble and rise through still, 
blue air. And for a few bars the pure
sweet tone of the horn and the old 
man's husky baritone sang a duet in the
hot heavy silence. "There's Many a 
Thousand Gone." And standing high up
over the park something fought in my 
throat. It was a song from the past,
the past of the campus and the still 
earlier past of home. And now some of
the older ones in the mass were joining 
in. I hadn't thought of it as a march
before, but now they were marching to 
its slow-paced rhythm, up the hill. I
looked for the euphonium player and saw 
a slender black man with his face
turned toward the sun, singing through 
the upturned bells of the horn. And
several yards behind, marching beside 
the young men floating the coffin
upward, I looked into the face of the 
old man who had aroused the song and
felt a twinge of envy. It was a worn, 
old, yellow face and his eyes were
closed and I could see a knife welt 
around his upturned neck as his throat
threw out the song. He sang with his 
whole body, phrasing each verse as
naturally as he walked, his voice 
rising above all the others, blending 
with
that of the lucid horn. I watched him 
now, wet-eyed, the sun hot upon my
head, and I felt a wonder at the 
singing mass. It was as though the song 
had
been there all the time and he knew it 
and aroused it; and I knew that I
had known it too and had failed to 
release it out of a vague, nameless 
shame
or fear. But he had known and aroused 
it. Even white brothers and sisters
were joining in. I looked into that 
face, trying to plumb its secret, but 
it told
me nothing. I looked at the coffin and 
the marchers, listening to them, and
yet realizing that I was listening to 
something within myself, and for a 
second
I heard the shattering stroke of my 
heart. Something deep had shaken the
crowd, and the old man and the man with 
the horn had done it. They had
touched upon something deeper than 
protest, or religion; though now images
of all the church meetings of my life 
welled up within me with much
suppressed and forgotten anger. But 
that was past, and too many of those
now reaching the top of the mountain 
and spreading massed together had

never shared it, and some had been born 
in other lands. And yet all were
touched; the song had aroused us all. 
It was not the words, for they were all
the same old slave-borne words; it was 
as though he'd changed the emotion
beneath the words while yet the old 
longing, resigned, transcendent emotion
still sounded above, now deepened by 
that something for which the theory of
Brotherhood had given me no name. I 
stood there trying to contain it as they
brought Tod Clifton's coffin into the 
tower and slowly up the spiral stairs.
They set it down upon the platform and 
I looked at the shape of the cheap
gray coffin and all I could remember 
was the sound of his name.
The song had ended. Now the top of the 
little mountain bristled with
banners, horns and uplifted faces. I 
could look straight down Fifth Avenue to
125th Street, where policemen were 
lined behind an array ot hot-dog wagons
and Good Humor carts; and among the 
carts I saw a peanut vendor standing
beneath a street lamp upon which 
pigeons were gathered, and now I saw him
stretch out his arms with his palms 
turned upward, and suddenly he was
covered, head, shoulders and outflung 
arms, with fluttering, feasting birds.
Someone nudged me and I started. It was 
time for final words. But I
had no words and I'd never been to a 
Brotherhood funeral and had no idea
of a ritual. But they were waiting. I 
stood there alone; there was no
microphone to support me, only the 
coffin before me upon the backs of its
wobbly carpenter's horses.
I looked down into their sun-swept 
faces, digging for the words, and
feeling a futility about it all and an 
anger. For this they gathered by
thousands. What were they waiting to 
hear? Why had they come? For what
reason that was different from that 
which had made the red-cheeked boy
thrill at Clifton's falling to the 
earth? What did they want and what could
they do? Why hadn't they come when they 
could have stopped it all?
"What are you waiting for me to tell 
you?" I shouted suddenly, my
voice strangely crisp on the windless 
air. "What good will it do? What if I
say that this isn't a funeral, that 
it's a holiday celebration, that if you 
stick
around the band will end up playing 
'Damit-the-Hell the Fun's All Over'? Or
do you expect to see some magic, the 
dead rise up and walk again? Go
home, he's as dead as he'll ever die. 
That's the end in the beginning and
there's no encore. There'll be no 
miracles and there's no one here to 
preach a
sermon. Go home, forget him. He's 
inside this box, newly dead. Go home and

don't think about him. He's dead and 
you've got all you can do to think
about you." I paused. They were 
whispering and looking upward.
"I've told you to go home," I shouted, 
"but you keep standing there.
Don't you know it's hot out here in the 
sun? So what if you wait for what
little I can tell you? Can I say in 
twenty minutes what was building
twenty-one years and ended in twenty 
seconds? What are you waiting for,
when all I can tell you is his name? 
And when I tell you, what will you
know that you didn't know already, 
except perhaps, his name?"
They were listening intently, and as 
though looking not at me, but at
the pattern of my voice upon the air.
"All right, you do the listening in the 
sun and I'll try to tell you in
the sun. Then you go home and forget 
it. Forget it. His name was Clifton
and they shot him down. His name was 
Clifton and he was tall and some
folks thought him handsome. And though 
he didn't belilve it, I think he was.
His name was Clifton and his face was 
black and his hair was thick with
tight-rolled curls -- or call them naps 
or kinks. He's dead, uninterested, and,
except to a few young girls, it doesn't 
matter . . . Have you got it? Can you
see him? Think of your brother or your 
cousin John. His lips were thick with
an upward curve at the corners. He 
often smiled. He had good eyes and a
pair of fast hands, and he had a heart. 
He thought about things and he felt
deeply. I won't call him noble because 
what's such a word to do with one of
us? His name was Clifton, Tod Clifton, 
and, like any man, he was born of
woman to live awhile and fall and die. 
So that's his tale to the minute. His
name was Clifton and for a while he 
lived among us and aroused a few
hopes in the young manhood of man, and 
we who knew him loved him and
he died. So why are you waiting? You've 
heard it all. Why wait for more,
when all I can do is repeat it?"
They stood; they listened. They gave no 
sign.
"Very well, so I'll tell you. His name 
was Clifton and he was young
and he was a leader and when he fell 
there was a hole in the heel of his
sock and when he stretched forward he 
seemed not as tall as when he stood.
So he died; and we who loved him are 
gathered here to mourn him. It's as
simple as that and as short as that. 
His name was Clifton and he was black
and they shot him. Isn't that enough to 
tell? Isn't it all you need to know?
Isn't that enough to appease your 
thirst for drama and send you home to

sleep it off? Go take a drink and 
forget it. Or read it in The Daily 
News. His
name was Clifton and they shot him, and 
I was there to see him fall. So I
know it as I know it.
"Here are the facts. He was standing 
and he fell. He fell and he
kneeled. He kneeled and he bled. He 
bled and he died. He tell in a heap like
any man and his blood spilled out like 
any blood; red as any blood, wet as
any blood and reflecting the sky and 
the buildings and birds and trees, or
your face if you'd looked into its 
dulling mirror -- and it dried in the 
sun as
blood dries. That's all. They spilled 
his blood and he bled. They cut him
down and he died; the blood flowed on 
the walk in a pool, gleamed a while,
and, after awhile, became dull then 
dusty, then dried. That's the story and
that's how it ended. It's an old story 
and there's been too much blood to
excite you. Besides, it's only 
important when it fills the veins of a 
living man.
Aren't you tired of such stories? 
Aren't you sick of the blood? Then why
listen, why don't you go? It's hot out 
here. There's the odor of embalming
fluid. The beer is cold in the taverns, 
the saxophones will be mellow at the
Savoy; plenty good-laughing-lies will 
be told in the barber shops and beauty
parlors; and there'll be sermons in two 
hundred churches in the cool of the
evening, and plenty of laughs at the 
movies. Go listen to 'Amos and Andy'
and forget it. Here you have only the 
same old story. There's not even a
young wife up here in red to mourn him. 
There's nothing here to pity, no
one to break down and shout. Nothing to 
give you that good old frightened
feeling. The story's too short and too 
simple. His name was Clifton, Tod
Clifton, he was unarmed and his death 
was as senseless as his life was futile.
He had struggled for Brotherhood on a 
hundred street corners and he
thought it would make him more human, 
but he died like any dog in a road.
"All right, all right," I called out, 
feeling desperate. It wasn't the way
I wanted it to go, it wasn't political. 
Brother Jack probably wouldn't approve
of it at all, but I had to keep going 
as I could go.
"Listen to me standing up on this 
so-called mountain!" I shouted.
"Let me tell it as it truly was! His 
name was Tod Clifton and he was full of
illusions. He thought he was a man when 
he was only Tod Clifton. He was
shot for a simple mistake of judgment 
and he bled and his blood dried and
shortly the crowd trampled out the 
stains. It was a normal mistake of which
many are guilty: He thought he was a 
man and that men were not meant to

be pushed around. But it was hot 
downtown and he forgot his history, he
forgot the time and the place. He lost 
his hold on reality. There was a cop
and a waiting audience but he was Tod 
Clifton and cops are everywhere. The
cop? What about him? He was a cop. A 
good citizen. But this cop had an
itching finger and an eager ear for a 
word that rhymed with 'trigger,' and
when Clifton fell he had found it. The 
Police Special spoke its lines and the
rhyme was completed. Just look around 
you. Look at what he made, look
inside you and feel his awful power. It 
was perfectly natural. The blood ran
like blood in a comic-book killing, on 
a comic-book street in a comic-book
town on a comic-book day in a 
comic-book world.
"Tod Clifton's one with the ages. But 
what's that to do with you in
this heat under this veiled sun? Now 
he's part of history, and he has 
received
his true freedom. Didn't they scribble 
his name on a standardized pad? His
Race: colored! Religion: unknown, 
probably born Baptist. Place of birth: 
U.S.
Some southern town. Next of kin: 
unknown. Address: unknown. Occupation:
unemployed. Cause of death (be 
specific): resisting reality in the 
form of a
.38 caliber revolver in the hands of 
the arresting officer, on Forty-second
between the library and the subway in 
the heat of the afternoon, of gunshot
wounds received from three bullets, 
fired at three paces, one bullet 
entering
the right ventricle of the heart, and 
lodging there, the other severing the
spinal ganglia traveling downward to 
lodge in the pelvis, the other breaking
through the back and traveling God 
knows where.
"Such was the short bitter life of 
Brother Tod Clifton. Now he's in
this box with the bolts tightened down. 
He's in the box and we're in there
with him, and when I've told you this 
you can go. It's dark in this box and
it's crowded. It has a cracked ceiling 
and a clogged-up toilet in the hall. It
has rats and roaches, and it's far, far 
too expensive a dwelling. The air is bad
and it'll be cold this winter. Tod 
Clifton is crowded and he needs the 
room.
'Tell them to get out of the box,' 
that's what he would say if you could 
hear
him. 'Tell them to get out of the box 
and go teach the cops to forget that
rhyme. Tell them to teach them that 
when they call you nigger to make a
rhyme with trigger it makes the gun 
backfire.'
"So there you have it. In a few hours 
Tod Clifton will be cold bones
in the ground. And don't be fooled, for 
these bones shall not rise again. You
and I will still be in the box. I don't 
know if Tod Clifton had a soul. I only

know the ache that I feel in my heart, 
my sense of loss. I don't know if you
have a soul. I only know you are men of 
flesh and blood; and that blood will
spill and flesh grow cold. I do not 
know if all cops are poets, but I know
that all cops carry guns with triggers. 
And I know too how we are labeled.
So in the name of Brother Clifton 
beware of the triggers; go home, keep 
cool,
stay safe away from the sun. Forget 
him. When he was alive he was our
hope, but why worry over a hope that's 
dead? So there's only one thing left
to tell and I've already told it. His 
name was Tod Clifton, he believed in
Brotherhood, he aroused our hopes and 
he died."
I couldn't go on. Below, they were 
waiting, hands and handkerchiefs
shading their eyes. A preacher stepped 
up and read something out of his
Bible, and I stood looking at the crowd 
with a sense of failure. I had let it
get away from me, had been unable to 
bring in the political issues. And they
stood there sun-beaten and 
sweat-bathed, listening to me repeat 
what was
known. Now the preacher had finished, 
and someone signaled the bandmaster
and there was solemn music as the 
pallbearers carried the coffin down the
spiraling stairs. The crowd stood still 
as we walked slowly through. I could
feel the bigness of it and the 
unknownness of it and a pent-up tension 
-whether of tears or anger, I couldn't 
tell. But as we walked through and
down the hill to the hearse, I could 
feel it. The crowd sweated and throbbed,
and though it was silent, there were 
many things directed toward me through
its eyes. At the curb were the hearse 
and a few cars, and in a few minutes
they were loaded and the crowd was 
still standing, looking on as we carried
Tod Clifton away. And as I took one 
last look I saw not a crowd but the set
faces of individual men and women.
We drove away and when the cars stopped 
moving there was a grave
and we placed him in it. The 
gravediggers sweated heavily and knew 
their
business and their brogue was Irish. 
They filled the grave quickly and we 
left.
Tod Clifton was underground.
I returned through the streets as tired 
as though I'd dug the grave
myself alone. I felt confused and 
listless moving through the crowds that
seemed to boil along in a kind of mist, 
as though the thin humid clouds had
thickened and settled directly above 
our heads. I wanted to go somewhere, to
some cool place to rest without 
thinking, but there was still too much 
to be
done; plans had to be made; the crowd's 
emotion had to be organized. I

crept along, walking a southern walk in 
southern weather, closing my eyes
from time to time against the dazzling 
reds, yellows and greens of cheap
sport shirts and summer dresses. The 
crowd boiled, sweated, heaved; women
with shopping bags, men with highly 
polished shoes. Even down South they'd
always shined their shoes. "Shined 
shoes, shoed shines," it rang in my 
head.
On Eighth Avenue, the market carts were 
parked hub to hub along the curb,
improvised canopies shading the 
withering fruits and vegetables. I 
could smell
the stench of decaying cabbage. A 
watermelon huckster stood in the shade
beside his truck, holding up a long 
slice of orange-mealed melon, crying his
wares with hoarse appeals to nostalgia, 
memories of childhood, green shade
and summer coolness. Oranges, cocoanuts 
and alligator pears lay in neat piles
on little tables. I passed, winding my 
way through the slowly moving crowd.
Stale and wilted flowers, rejected 
downtown, blazed feverishly on a cart, 
like
glamorous rags festering beneath a 
futile spray from a punctured fruit 
juice
can. The crowd were boiling figures 
seen through steaming glass from inside
a washing machine; and in the streets 
the mounted police detail stood looking
on, their eyes noncommittal beneath the 
short polished visors of their caps,
their bodies slanting forward, reins 
slackly alert, men and horses of flesh
imitating men and horses of stone. Tod 
Clifton's Tod, I thought. The
hucksters cried above the traffic 
sounds and I seemed to hear them from a
distance, unsure of what they said. In 
a side street children with warped
tricycles were parading along the walk 
carrying one of the signs, BROTHER
TOD CLIFTON, OUR HOPE SHOT DOWN.
And through the haze I again felt the 
tension. There was no denying
it; it was there and something had to 
be done before it simmered away in
the heat.

Chapter 22
When I saw them sitting in their 
shirtsleeves, leaning forward,
gripping their crossed knees with their 
hands, I wasn't surprised. I'm glad it's

you, I thought, this will be business 
without tears. It was as though I had
expected to find them there, just as in 
those dreams in which I encountered
my grandfather looking at me from 
across the dimensionless space of a
dream-room. I looked back without 
surprise or emotion, although I knew 
even
in the dream that surprise was the 
normal reaction and that the lack of it
was to be distrusted, a warning.
I stood just inside the room, watching 
them as I slipped off my
jacket, seeing them grouped around a 
small table upon which there rested a
pitcher of water, a glass and a couple 
of smoking ash trays. One half of the
room was dark and only one light 
burned, directly above the table. They
regarded me silently, Brother Jack with 
a smile that went no deeper than his
lips, his head cocked to one side, 
studying me with his penetrating eyes; 
the
others blank-faced, looking out of eyes 
that were meant to reveal nothing and
to stir profound uncertainty. The smoke 
rose in spirals from their cigarettes
as they sat perfectly contained, 
waiting. So you came, after all, I 
thought,
going over and dropping into one of the 
chairs. I rested my arm on the
table, noticing its coolness.
"Well, how did it go?" Brother Jack 
said, extending his clasped hands
across the table and looking at me with 
his head to one side.
"You saw the crowd," I said. "We 
finally got them out."
"No, we did not see the crowd. How was 
it?"
"They were moved," I said, "a great 
number of them. But beyond
that I don't know. They were with us, 
but how far I don't know . . ." And
for a moment I could hear my own voice 
in the quiet of the high-ceilinged
hall.
"Sooo! Is that all the great tactician 
has to tell us?" Brother Tobitt
said. "In what direction were they 
moved?"
I looked at him, aware of the numbness 
of my emotions; they had
flowed in one channel too long and too 
deeply.
"That's for the committee to decide. 
They were aroused, that was all
we could do. We tried again and again 
to reach the committee for guidance
but we couldn't."
"So?"
"So we went ahead on my personal 
responsibility."
Brother Jack's eyes narrowed. "What was 
that?" he said. "Your what?"

"My personal responsibility," I said.
"His personal responsibility," Brother 
Jack said. "Did you hear that,
Brothers? Did I hear him correctly. 
Where did you get it, Brother?" he said.
"This is astounding, where did you get 
it?"
"From your ma --" I started and caught 
myself in time. "From the
committee," I said.
There was a pause. I looked at him, his 
face reddening, as I tried to
get my bearings. A nerve trembled in 
the center of my stomach.
"Everyone came out," I said, trying to 
fill it in. "We saw the
opportunity and the community agreed 
with us. It's too bad you missed it . .
."
"You see, he's sorry we missed it," 
Brother Jack said. He held up his
hand. I could see the deeply etched 
lines in his palm. "The great tactician 
of
personal responsibility regrets our 
absence . . ."
Doesn't he see how I feel, I thought, 
can't he see why I did it?
What's he trying to do? Tobitt's a 
fool, but why is he taking it up?
"You could have taken the next step," I 
said, forcing the words. "We
went as far as we could . . ."
"On your personal re-spon-si-bility," 
Brother Jack said, bowing his
head in time with the words.
I looked at him steadily now. "I was 
told to win back our following,
so I tried. The only way I knew how. 
What's your criticism? What's wrong?"
"So now," he said, rubbing his eye with 
a delicate circular movement
of his fist, "the great tactician asks 
what's wrong. Is it possible that
something could be wrong? Do you hear 
him, Brothers?"
There was a cough. Someone poured a 
glass of water and I could
hear it fill up very fast, then the 
rapid rill-like trickle of the final 
drops
dripping from the pitcher-lip into the 
glass. I looked at him, my mind trying
to bring things into focus.
"You mean he admits the possibility of 
being incorrect?" Tobitt said.
"Sheer modesty, Brother. The sheerest 
modesty. We have here an
extraordinary tactician, a Napoleon of 
strategy and personal responsibility.
'Strike while the iron is hot' is his 
motto. 'Seize the instance by its 
throat,'
'Shoot at the whites of their eyes,' 
'Give 'em the ax, the ax, the ax,' and 
so
forth."

I stood up. "I don't know what this is 
all about, Brother. What are
you trying to say?"
"Now there is a good question, 
Brothers. Sit down, please, it's hot.
He wants to know what we're trying to 
say. We have here not only an
extraordinary tactician, but one who 
has an appreciation for subtleties of
expression."
"Yes, and for sarcasm, when it's good," 
I said.
"And for discipline? Sit down, please, 
it's hot . . ."
"And for discipline. And for orders and 
consultation when it's
possible to have them," I said.
Brother Jack grinned. "Sit down, sit 
down -- And for patience?"
"When I'm not sleepy and exhausted," I 
said, "and not overheated as
I am just now."
"You'll learn," he said. "You'll learn 
and you'll surrender yourself to it
even under such conditions. Especially 
under such conditions; that's its value.
That makes it patience."
"Yes, I guess I'm learning now," I 
said. "Right now."
"Brother," he said drily, "you have no 
idea how much you're learning
-- Please sit down."
"All right," I said, sitting down 
again. "But while ignoring my
personal education for a second I'd 
like you to remember that the people
have little patience with us these 
days. We could use this time more
profitably."
"And I could tell you that politicians 
are not personal persons,"
Brother Jack said, "but I won't. How 
could we use it more profitably?"
"By organizing their anger."
"So again our great tactician has 
relieved himself. Today he's a busy
man. First an oration over the body of 
Brutus, and now a lecture on the
patience of the Negro people."
Tobitt was enjoying himself. I could 
see his cigarette tremble in his
lips as he struck a match to light it.
"I move we issue his remarks in a 
pamphlet," he said, running his
finger over his chin. "They should 
create a natural phenomenon . . ."
This had better stop right here, I 
thought. My head was getting
lighter and my chest felt tight.

"Look," I said, "an unarmed man was 
killed. A brother, a leading
member shot down by a policeman. We had 
lost our prestige in the
community. I saw the chance to rally 
the people, so I acted. If that was
incorrect, then I did wrong, so say it 
straight without this crap. It'll take
more than sarcasm to deal with that 
crowd out there."
Brother Jack reddened; the others 
exchanged glances.
"He hasn't read the newspapers," 
someone said.
"You forget," Brother Jack said, "it 
wasn't necessary; he was there."
"Yes, I was there," I said. "If you're 
referring to the killing."
"There, you see," Brother Jack said. 
"He was on the scene."
Brother Tobitt pushed the table edge 
with his palms. "And still you
organized that side show of a funeral!"
My nose twitched. I turned toward him 
deliberately, forcing a grin.
"How could there be a side show without 
you as the star attraction,
who'd draw the two bits admission, 
Brother Twobits? What was wrong with
the funeral?"
"Now we're making progress," Brother 
Jack said, straddling his chair.
"The strategist has raised a very 
interesting question. What's wrong, he 
asks.
All right, I'll answer. Under your 
leadership, a traitorous merchant of 
vile
instruments of anti-Negro, 
anti-minority racist bigotry has 
received the funeral
of a hero. Do you still ask what's 
wrong?"
"But nothing was done about a traitor," 
I said.
He half-stood, gripping the back of his 
chair. "We all heard you
admit it."
"We dramatized the shooting down of an 
unarmed black man."
He threw up his hands. To hell with 
you, I thought. To hell with
you. He was a man!
"That black man, as you call him, was a 
traitor," Brother Jack said.
"A traitor!"
"What is a traitor, Brother?" I asked, 
feeling an angry amusement as
I counted on my fingers. "He was a man 
and a Negro; a man and a brother;
a man and a traitor, as you say; then 
he was a dead man, and alive or dead
he was jam-full of contradictions. So 
full that he attracted half of Harlem to
come out and stand in the sun in answer 
to our call. So what is a traitor?"
"So now he retreats," Brother Jack 
said. "Observe him, Brothers.

After putting the movement in the 
position of forcing a traitor down the
throats of the Negroes he asks what a 
traitor is."
"Yes," I said. "Yes, and, as you say, 
it's a fair question, Brother.
Some folks call me traitor because I've 
been working downtown; some would
call me a traitor if I was in Civil 
Service and others if I simply sat in my
corner and kept quiet. Sure, I 
considered what Clifton did --"
"And you defend him!"
"Not for that. I was as disgusted as 
you. But hell, isn't the shooting
of an unarmed man of more importance 
politically than the fact that he sold
obscene dolls?"
"So you exercised your personal 
responsibility," Jack said.
"That's all I had to go on. I wasn't 
called to the strategy meeting,
remember."
"Didn't you see what you were playing 
with?" Tobitt said. "Have you
no respect for your people?"
"It was a dangerous mistake to give you 
the opportunity," one of the
others said.
I looked across at him. "The committee 
can take it away, if it wishes.
But meantime, why is everyone so upset? 
If even one-tenth of the people
looked at the dolls as we do, our work 
would be a lot easier. The dolls are
nothing."
"Nothing," Jack said. "That nothing 
that might explode in our face."
I sighed. "Your faces are safe, 
Brother," I said. "Can't you see that
they don't think in such abstract 
terms? If they did, perhaps the new
program wouldn't have flopped. The 
Brotherhood isn't the Negro people; no
organization is. All you see in 
Clifton's death is that it might harm 
the
prestige of the Brotherhood. You see 
him only as a traitor. But Harlem
doesn't react that way."
"Now he's lecturing us on the 
conditioned reflexes of the Negro
people," Tobitt said.
I looked at him. I was very tired. "And 
what is the source of your
great contributions to the movement, 
Brother? A career in burlesque? And of
your profound knowledge of Negroes? Are 
you from an old plantation-owning
family? Does your black mammy shuffle 
nightly through your dreams?"
He opened his mouth and closed it like 
a fish. "I'll have you know

that I'm married to a fine, intelligent 
Negro girl," he said.
So that's what makes you so cocky, I 
thought, seeing now how the
light struck him at an angle and made a 
wedge-shaped shadow beneath his
nose. So that's it . . . and how did I 
guess there was a woman in it?
"Brother, I apologize," I said. "I 
misjudged you. You have our
number. In fact, you must be 
practically a Negro yourself. Was it by
immersion or injection?"
"Now see here," he said, pushing back 
his chair.
Come on, I thought, just make a move. 
Just another little move.
"Brothers," Jack said, his eyes on me. 
"Let's stick to the discussion.
I'm intrigued. You were saying?"
I watched Tobitt. He glared. I grinned.
"I was saying that up here we know that 
the policemen didn't care
about Clifton's ideas. He was shot 
because he was black and because he
resisted. Mainly because he was black."
Brother Jack frowned. "You're riding 
'race' again. But how do they
feel about the dolls?"
"I'm riding the race I'm forced to 
ride," I said. "And as for the dolls,
they know that as far as the cops were 
concerned Clifton could have been
selling song sheets. Bibles, matzos. If 
he'd been white, he'd be alive. Or if
he'd accepted being pushed around . . ."
"Black and white, white and black," 
Tobitt said. "Must we listen to
this racist nonsense?"
"You don't, Brother Negro," I said. 
"You get your own information
straight from the source. Is it a 
mulatto source, Brother? Don't answer 
-- the
only thing wrong is that your source is 
too narrow. You don't really think
that

crowd

turned

out

today

because

Clifton

was

a

member

of

the

Brotherhood?"
"And why did they turn out?" Jack said, 
getting set as if to pounce
forward.
"Because we gave them the opportunity 
to express their feelings, to
affirm themselves."
Brother Jack rubbed his eye. "Do you 
know that you have become
quite a theoretician?" he said. "You 
astound me."
"I doubt that, Brother, but there's 
nothing like isolating a man to

make him think," I said.
"Yes, that's true; some of our best 
ideas have been thought in prison.
Only you haven't been in prison, 
Brother, and you were not hired to 
think.
Had you forgotten that? If so, listen 
to me: You were not hired to think." He
was speaking very deliberately and I 
thought, So . . . So here it is, naked
and old and rotten. So now it's out in 
the open . . .
"So now I know where I am," I said, 
"and with whom --"
"Don't twist my meaning. For all of us, 
the committee does the
thinking. For all of us. And you were 
hired to talk."
"That's right, I was hired. Things have 
been so brotherly I had
forgotten my place. But what if I wish 
to express an idea?"
"We furnish all ideas. We have some 
acute ones. Ideas are part of
our apparatus. Only the correct ideas 
for the correct occasion."
"And suppose you misjudge the occasion?"
"Should that ever happen, you keep 
quiet."
"Even though I am correct?"
"You say nothing unless it is passed by 
the committee. Otherwise I
suggest you keep saying the last thing 
you were told."
"And when my people demand that I 
speak?"
"The committee will have an answer!"
I looked at him. The room was hot, 
quiet, smoky. The others looked
at me strangely. I heard the nervous 
sound of someone mashing out a
cigarette in a glass ash tray. I pushed 
back my chair, breathing deeply,
controlled. I was on a dangerous road 
and I thought of Clifton and tried to
get off of it. I said nothing.
Suddenly Jack smiled and slipped back 
into his fatherly role.
"Let us handle the theory and the 
business of strategy," he said. "We
are experienced. We're graduates and 
while you are a smart beginner you
skipped several grades. But they were 
important grades, especially for gaining
strategical knowledge. For such it is 
necessary to see the overall picture. 
More
is involved than meets the eye. With 
the long view and the short view and
the

overall

view

mastered,

perhaps

you

won't

slander

the

political

consciousness of the people of Harlem."
Can't he see I'm trying to tell them 
what's real, I thought. Does my
membership stop me from feeling Harlem?

"All right," I said. "Have it your way, 
Brother; only the political
consciousness of Harlem is exactly a 
thing I know something about. That's
one class they wouldn't let me skip. 
I'm describing a part of reality which I
know."
"And that is the most questionable 
statement of all," Tobitt said.
"I know," I said, running my thumb 
along the edge of the table,
"your private source tells you 
differently. History's made at night, 
eh,
Brother?"
"I've warned you," Tobitt said.
"Brother to brother, Brother," I said, 
"try getting around more. You
might learn that today was the first 
time that they've listened to our 
appeals
in weeks. And I'll tell you something 
else: If we don't follow through on what
was done today, this might be the last 
. . ."
"So, he's finally gotten around to 
predicting the future," Brother Jack
said.
"It's possible . . . though I hope not."
"He's in touch with God," Tobitt said. 
"The black God."
I looked at him and grinned. He had 
gray eyes and his irises were
very wide, the muscles ridged out on 
his jaws. I had his guard down and he
was swinging wild.
"Not with God, nor with your wife, 
Brother," I told him. "I've never
met either. But I've worked among the 
people up here. Ask your wife to take
you around to the gin mills and the 
barber shops and the juke joints and the
churches, Brother. Yes, and the beauty 
parlors on Saturdays when they're
frying hair. A whole unrecorded history 
is spoken then, Brother. You wouldn't
believe it but it's true. Tell her to 
take you to stand in the areaway of a
cheap tenement at night and listen to 
what is said. Put her out on the
corner, let her tell you what's being 
put down. You'll learn that a lot of
people are angry because we failed to 
lead them in action. I'll stand on that
as I stand on what I see and feel and 
on what I've heard, and what I know."
"No," Brother Jack said, getting to his 
feet, "you'll stand on the
decision of the committee. We've had 
enough of this. The committee makes
your decisions and it is not its 
practice to give undue importance to the
mistaken notions of the people. What's 
happened to your discipline?"
"I'm not arguing against discipline. 
I'm trying to be useful. I'm trying

to point out a part of reality which 
the committee seems to have missed.
With just one demonstration we could --"
"The committee has decided against such 
demonstrations," Brother
Jack said. "Such methods are no longer 
effective."
Something seemed to move out from under 
me, and out of the
corner of my eye I was suddenly aware 
of objects on the dark side of the
hall. "But didn't anyone see what 
happened today?" I said. "What was 
that, a
dream? What was ineffective about that 
crowd?"
"Such crowds are only our raw 
materials, one of the raw materials to
be shaped to our program."
I looked around the table and shook my 
head. "No wonder they
insult me and accuse us of betraying 
them . . ."
There was a sudden movement.
"Repeat that," Brother Jack shouted, 
stepping forward.
"It's true, I'll repeat it. Until this 
afternoon they've been saying that
the Brotherhood betrayed them. I'm 
telling you what's been said to me, and
that it why Brother Clifton 
disappeared."
"That's an indefensible lie," Brother 
Jack said.
And I looked at him slowly now, 
thinking, If this is it, this is it . . 
.
"Don't call me that," I said softly. 
"Don't ever call me that, none of you. 
I've
told you what I've heard." My hand was 
in my pocket now, Brother Tarp's
leg chain around my knuckles. I looked 
at each of them individually, trying to
hold myself back and yet feeling it 
getting away from me. My head was
whirling as though I were riding a 
supersonic merry-go-round. Jack looked 
at
me, a new interest behind his eyes, 
leaned forward.
"So you've heard it," he said. "Very 
well, so now hear this: We do
not shape our policies to the mistaken 
and infantile notions of the man in
the street. Our job is not to ask them 
what they think but to tell them!"
"You've said that," I said, "and that's 
one thing you can tell them
yourself. Who are you, anyway, the 
great white father?"
"Not their father, their leader. And 
.your leader. And don't forget it."
"My leader sure, but what's your exact 
relationship to them?"
His red head bristled. "The leader. As 
leader of the Brotherhood, I
am their leader."
"But are you sure you aren't their 
great white father?" I said,

watching him closely, aware of the hot 
silence and feeling tension race from
my toes to my legs as I drew my feet 
quickly beneath me. "Wouldn't it be
better if they called you Marse Jack?"
"Now see here," he began, leaping to 
his feet to lean across the
table, and I spun my chair half around 
on its hind legs as he came between
me and the light, gripping the edge of 
the table, spluttering and lapsing into
a foreign language, choking and 
coughing and shaking his head as I 
balanced
on my toes now, set to propel myself 
forward; seeing him above me and the
others behind him as suddenly something 
seemed to erupt out of his face.
You're seeing things, I thought, 
hearing it strike sharply against the 
table and
roll as his arm shot out and snatched 
an object the size of a large marble
and dropped it, plop! into his glass, 
and I could see the water shooting up in
a ragged, light-breaking pattern to 
spring in swift droplets across the 
oiled
table top. The room seemed to flatten. 
I shot to a high plateau above them
and down, feeling the jolt on the end 
of my spine as the chair legs struck
the floor. The merry-go-round had 
speeded up, I heard his voice but no
longer listened. I stared at the glass, 
seeing how the light shone through,
throwing a transparent, precisely 
fluted shadow against the dark grain of 
the
table, and there on the bottom of the 
glass lay an eye. A glass eye. A
buttermilk white eye distorted by the 
light rays. An eye staring fixedly at me
as from the dark waters of a well. Then 
I was looking at him standing above
me, outlined by the light against the 
darkened half of the hall.
". . . You must accept discipline. 
Either you accept decisions or you
get out . . ."
I stared into his face, feeling a sense 
of outrage. His left eye had
collapsed, a line of raw redness 
showing where the lid refused to close, 
and
his gaze had lost its command. I looked 
from his face to the glass, thinking,
he's disemboweled himself just in order 
to confound me . . . And the others
had known it all along. They aren't 
even surprised. I stared at the eye, 
aware
of Jack pacing up and down, shouting.
"Brother, are you following me?" He 
stopped, squinting at me with
Cyclopean irritation. "What is the 
matter?"
I stared up at him, unable to answer.
Then he understood and approached the 
table, smiling maliciously.
"So that's it. So it makes you 
uncomfortable, does it? You're a 
sentimentalist,"

he said, sweeping up the glass and 
causing the eye to turn over in the 
water
so that now it seemed to peer down at 
me from the ringed bottom of the
glass. He smiled, holding the tumbler 
level with his empty socket, swirling 
the
glass. "You didn't know about this?"
"No, and I didn't want to know."
Someone laughed.
"See, that demonstrates how long you've 
been with us." He lowered
the glass. "I lost my eye in the line 
of duty. What do you think of that?" he
said with a pride that made me all the 
angrier.
"I don't give a damn how you lost it as 
long as you keep it hidden."
"That is because you don't appreciate 
the meaning of sacrifice. I was
ordered to carry through an objective 
and I carried it through. Understand?
Even though I had to lose my eye to do 
it . . ."
He was gloating now, holding up the eye 
in the glass as though it
were a medal of merit.
"Not much like that traitor Clifton, is 
it?" Tobitt said.
The others were amused.
"All right," I said. "All right! It was 
a heroic act. It saved the world,
now hide the bleeding wound!"
"Don't overevaluate it," Jack said, 
quieter now. "The heroes are those
who die. This was nothing -- after it 
happened. A minor lesson in discipline.
And do you know what discipline is, 
Brother Personal Responsibility? It's
sacrifice, sacrifice, SACRIFICE!"
He slammed the glass upon the table, 
splashing the water on the
back of my hand. I shook like a leaf. 
So that is the meaning of discipline, I
thought, sacrifice . . . yes, and 
blindness; he doesn't see me. He 
doesn't even
see me. Am I about to strangle him? I 
do not know. He cannot possibly. I
still do not know. See! Discipline is 
sacrifice. Yes, and blindness. Yes. And 
me
sitting here while he tries to 
intimidate me. That's it, with his 
goddam blind
glass eye . . . Should you show him you 
get it? Shouldn't you? Shouldn't he
know it? Hurry! Shouldn't you? Look at 
it there, a good job, an almost
perfect imitation that seemed alive . . 
. Should you, shouldn't you? Maybe he
got it where he learned that language 
he lapsed into. Shouldn't you? Make
him speak the unknown tongue, the 
language of the future. What's mattering
with you? Discipline. Is learning, 
didn't he say? Is it? I stand? You're 
sitting

here, ain't I? You're holding on, ain't 
I? He said you'd learn so you're
learning, so he saw it all the time. 
He's a riddler, shouldn't we show him? 
So
sit still is the way, and learn, never 
mind the eye, it's dead . . . All right
now, look at him, see him turning now, 
left, right, coming short-legged
toward you. See him, hep, hep! the 
one-eyed beacon. All right, all right . 
. .
Hep, hep! The short-legged deacon. All 
right! Nail him! The short-changing
dialectical deacon . . . All right. 
There, so now you're learning . . . Get 
it
under control . . . Patience . . . Yes 
. . .
I looked at him again as for the first 
time, seeing a little bantam
rooster of a man with a high-domed 
forehead and a raw eye-socket that
wouldn't quite accept its lid. I looked 
at him carefully now with some of the
red spots fading and with the feeling 
that I was just awakening from a
dream. I had boomeranged around.
"I realize how you feel," he said, 
becoming an actor who'd just
finished a part in a play and was 
speaking again in his natural voice. "I
remember the first time I saw myself 
this way and it wasn't pleasant. And
don't think I wouldn't rather have my 
old one back." He felt in the water for
his eye now, and I could see its smooth 
half-spherical, half-amorphous form
slip between his two fingers and spurt 
around the glass as though looking for
a way to break out. Then he had it, 
shaking off the water and breathing
upon it as he walked across to the dark 
side of the room.
"But who knows, Brothers," he said, 
with his back turned, "perhaps if
we do our work successfully the new 
society will provide me with a living
eye. Such a thing is not at all 
fantastic, although I've been without 
mine for
quite a while . . . What time is it, by 
the way?"
But what kind of society will make him 
see me, I thought, hearing
Tobitt answer, "Six-fifteen."
"Then we'd better leave immediately, 
we've got a long way to travel,"
he said, coming across the floor. He 
had his eye in place now and he was
smiling. "How's that?" he asked me.
I nodded, I was very tired. I simply 
nodded.
"Good," he said. "I sincerely hope it 
never happens to you. Sincerely."
"If it should, maybe you'll recommend 
me to your oculist," I said,
"then I may not-see myself as others 
see-me-not."
He looked at me oddly then laughed. 
"See, Brothers, he's joking. He

feels brotherly again. But just the 
same, I hope you'll never need one of
these. Meanwhile go and see Hambro. 
He'll outline the program and give you
the instructions. As for today, just 
let things float. It is a development 
that is
important only if we make it so. 
Otherwise it will be forgotten," he 
said,
getting into his jacket. "And you'll 
see that it's best. The Brotherhood must
act as a co-ordinated unit."
I looked at him. I was becoming aware 
of smells again and I needed
a bath. The others were standing now 
and moving toward the door. I stood
up, feeling the shirt sticking to my 
back.
"One last thing," Jack said, placing 
his hand on my shoulder and
speaking quietly. "Watch that temper, 
that's discipline, too. Learn to 
demolish
your brotherly opponents with ideas, 
with polemic skill. The other is for our
enemies. Save it for them. And go get 
some rest."
I was beginning to tremble. His face 
seemed to advance and recede,
recede and advance. He shook his head 
and smiled grimly.
"I know how you feel," he said. "And 
it's too bad all that effort was
for nothing. But that in itself is a 
kind of discipline. I speak to you of 
what I
have learned and I'm a great deal older 
than you. Good night."
I looked at his eye. So he knows how I 
feel. Which eye is really the
blind one? "Good night," I said.
"Good night, Brother," they all except 
Tobitt said.
It'll be night, but it won't be good, I 
thought, calling a final "Good
night."
They left and I took my jacket and went 
and sat at my desk. I heard
them passing down the stairs and the 
closing of the door below. I felt as
though I'd been watching a bad comedy. 
Only it was real and I was living it
and it was the only historically 
meaningful life that I could live. If I 
left it,
I'd be nowhere. As dead and as 
meaningless as Clifton. I felt for the 
doll in
the shadow and dropped it on the desk. 
He was dead all right, and nothing
would come of his death now. He was 
useless even for a scavenger action.
He had waited too long, the directives 
had changed on him. He'd barely
gotten by with a funeral. And that was 
all. It was only a matter of a few
days, but he had missed and there was 
nothing I could do. But at least he
was dead and out of it.
I sat there a while, growing wilder and 
fighting against it. I couldn't

leave and I had to keep contact in 
order to fight. But I would never be the
same. Never. After tonight I wouldn't 
ever look the same, or feel the same.
Just what I'd be, I didn't know; I 
couldn't go back to what I was -- which
wasn't much -- but I'd lost too much to 
be what I was. Some of me, too,
had died with Tod Clifton. So I would 
see Hambro, for whatever it was
worth. I got up and went out into the 
hall. The glass was still on the table
and I swept it across the room, hearing 
it rumble and roll in the dark. Then
I went downstairs.

Chapter 23
The bar downstairs was hot and crowded 
and there was a heated
argument in progress over Clifton's 
shooting. I stood near the door and
ordered a bourbon. Then someone noticed 
me, and they tried to draw me in.
"Please, not tonight," I said. "He was 
one of my best friends."
"Oh, sure," they said, and I had 
another bourbon and left.
When I reached 125th Street, I was 
approached by a group of
civil-liberties workers circulating a 
petition demanding the dismissal of the
guilty policeman, and a block further 
on even the familiar woman street
preacher was shouting a sermon about 
the slaughter of the innocents. A much
broader group was stirred up over the 
shooting than I had imagined. Good, I
thought, perhaps it won't die down 
after all. Maybe I'd better see Hambro
tonight.
Little groups were all along the 
street, and I moved with increasing
speed until suddenly I had reached 
Seventh Avenue, and there beneath a
street lamp with the largest crowd 
around him was Ras the Exhorter -- the
last man in the world I wanted to see. 
And I had just turned back when I
saw him lean down between his flags, 
shouting, "Look, look, Black ladies and
gentlemahn! There goes the 
representative of the Brotherhood. Does 
Ras see
correctly? Is that gentlemahn trying to 
pass us unnoticed? Ask him about it.
What are you people waiting for, sir? 
What are you doing about our black

youth shot down beca'se of your 
deceitful organization?"
They turned, looking at me, closing in. 
Some came up behind me
and tried to push me further into the 
crowd. The Exhorter leaned down,
pointing at me, beneath the green 
traffic light.
"Ask him what they are doing about it, 
ladies and gentlemahn. Are
they afraid -- or are the white folks 
and their black stooges sticking 
together
to betray us?"
"Get your hands off me," I shouted as 
someone reached around and
seized my arm.
I heard a voice cursing me softly.
"Give the brother a chance to answer!" 
someone said.
Their faces pressed in upon me. I 
wanted to laugh, for suddenly I
realized that I didn't know whether I 
had been part of a sellout or not. But
they were in no mood for laughter.
"Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and 
sisters," I said, "I disdain to
answer such an attack. Since you all 
know me and my work, I don't think it's
necessary. But it seems highly 
dishonorable to use the unfortunate 
death of
one of our most promising young men as 
an excuse for attacking an
organization that has worked to bring 
an end to such outrages. Who was the
first organization to act against this 
killing? The Brotherhood! Who was the
first to arouse the people? The 
Brotherhood! Who will always be the 
first to
advance the cause of the people? Again 
the Brotherhood!
"We acted and we shall always act, I 
assure you. But in our own
disciplined way. And we'll act 
positively. We refuse to waste our 
energies and
yours in premature and ill-considered 
actions. We are Americans, all of us,
whether black or white, regardless of 
what the man on the ladder there tells
you, Americans. And we leave it to the 
gentleman up there to abuse the
name of the dead. The Brotherhood 
grieves and feels deeply the loss of its
brother. And we are determined that his 
death shall be the beginning of
profound and lasting changes. It's easy 
enough to wait around for the minute
a man is safely buried and then stand 
on a ladder and smear the memory of
everything he believed in. But to 
create something lasting of his death 
takes
time and careful planning --"
"Gentlemahn," Ras shouted, "stick to 
the issue. You are not answering
my question. What are you doing about 
the shooting?"

I moved toward the edge of the crowd. 
If this went any further, it
could be disastrous.
"Stop abusing the dead for your own 
selfish ends," I said. "Let him
rest in peace. Quit mangling his 
corpse!"
I pushed away as he raged, hearing 
shouts of, "Tell him about it!"
"Grave robber!"
The Exhorter waved his arms and 
pointed, shouting, "That mahn is a
paid stooge of the white enslaver! 
Wheere has he been for the last few
months when our black babies and women 
have been suffering --"
"Let the dead rest in peace," I 
shouted, hearing someone call "Aw
man, go back to Africa. Everybody knows 
the brother."
Good, I thought, good. Then there was a 
scuffle behind me and I
whirled to see two men stop short. They 
were Ras's men.
"Listen, mister," I said up to him, "if 
you know what's good for you,
you'll call off your goons. Two of them 
seem to want to follow me."
"And that is a dahm lie!" he shouted.
"There are witnesses if anything should 
happen to me. A man who'll
dig up the dead hardly before he's 
buried will try anything, but I warn you
--"
There were angry shouts from some of 
the crowd and I saw the men
continue past me with hate in their 
eyes, leaving the crowd to disappear
around the corner. Ras was attacking 
the Brotherhood now and others were
answering him from the audience, and I 
went on, moving back toward Lenox,
moving past a movie house when they 
grabbed me and started punching. But
this time they'd picked the wrong spot, 
and the movie doorman intervened
and they ran back toward Ras's street 
meeting. I thanked the doorman and
went on. I had been lucky; they hadn't 
hurt me, but Ras was becoming bold
again. On a less crowded street they 
might have done some damage.
Reaching the Avenue I stepped to the 
curb and signaled a cab, seeing
it sail by. An ambulance went past, 
then another cab with its flag down. I
looked back. I felt that they were 
watching me from somewhere up the street
but I couldn't see them. Why didn't a 
taxi come! Then three men in natty
cream-colored summer suits came to 
stand near me at the curb, and
something about them struck me like a 
hammer. They were all wearing dark
glasses. I had seen it thousands of 
times, but suddenly what I had 
considered

an empty imitation of a Hollywood fad 
was flooded with personal significance.
Why not, I thought, why not, and shot 
across the street and into the
air-conditioned chill of a drugstore.
I saw them on a case strewn with sun 
visors, hair nets, rubber
gloves, a card of false eyelashes, and 
seized the darkest lenses I could find.
They were of a green glass so dark that 
it appeared black, and I put them on
immediately, plunging into blackness 
and moving outside.
I could barely see; it was almost dark 
now, and the streets swarmed
in a green vagueness. I moved slowly 
across to stand near the subway and
wait for my eyes to adjust. A strange 
wave of excitement boiled within me as
I peered out at the sinister light. And 
now through the hot gusts from the
underground people were emerging and I 
could feel the trains vibrating the
walk. A cab rolled up to discharge a 
passenger and I was about to take it
when the woman came up the stairs and 
stopped before me, smiling. Now
what, I thought, seeing her standing 
there, smiling in her tight-fitting 
summer
dress; a large young woman who reeked 
with Christmas Night perfume who
now came close.
"Rinehart, baby, is that you?" she said.
Rinehart, I thought. So it works. She 
had her hand on my arm and
faster than I thought I heard myself 
answer, "Is that you, baby?" and waited
with tense breath.
"Well, for once you're on time," she 
said. "But what you doing
bareheaded, where's your new hat I 
bought you?"
I wanted to laugh. The scent of 
Christmas Night was enfolding me
now and I saw her face draw closer, her 
eyes widening.
"Say, you ain't Rinehart, man. What you 
trying to do? You don't even
talk like Rine. What's your story?"
I laughed, backing away. "I guess we 
were both mistaken," I said.
She stepped backward clutching her bag, 
watching me, confused.
"I really meant no harm," I said. "I'm 
sorry. Who was it you mistook
me for?"
"Rinehart, and you'd better not let him 
catch you pretending to be
him."
"No," I said. "But you seemed so 
pleased to see him that I couldn't
resist it. He's really a lucky man."

"And I could have sworn you was -- Man, 
you git away from here
before you get me in trouble," she 
said, moving aside, and I left.
It was very strange. But that about the 
hat was a good idea, I
thought, hurrying along now and looking 
out for Ras's men. I was wasting
time. At the first hat shop I went in 
and bought the widest hat in stock and
put it on. With this, I thought, I 
should be seen even in a snowstorm -- 
only
they'd think I was someone else.
Then I was back in the street and 
moving toward the subway. My
eyes adjusted quickly; the world took 
on a dark-green intensity, the lights of
cars glowed like stars, faces were a 
mysterious blur; the garish signs of 
movie
houses muted down to a soft sinister 
glowing. I headed back for Ras's
meeting with a bold swagger. This was 
the real test, if it worked I would go
on to Hambro's without further trouble. 
In the angry period to come I would
be able to move about.
A couple of men approached, eating up 
the walk with long jaunty
strides that caused their heavy silk 
sport shirts to flounce rhythmically 
upon
their bodies. They too wore dark 
glasses, their hats were set high upon 
their
heads, the brims turned down. A couple 
of hipsters, I thought, just as they
spoke.
"What you sayin', daddy-o," they said.
"Rinehart, poppa, tell us what you 
putting down," they said.
Oh, hell, they're probably his friends, 
I thought, waving and moving
on.
"We know what you're doing, Rinehart," 
one of them called. "Play it
cool, ole man, play it cool!"
I waved again as though in on the joke. 
They laughed behind me. I
was nearing the end of the block now, 
wet with sweat. Who was this
Rinehart and what was he putting down? 
I'd have to learn more about him
to avoid further misidentifications . . 
.
A car passed with its radio blaring. 
Ahead I could hear the Exhorter
barking harshly to the crowd. Then I 
was moving close, and coming to a stop
conspicuously in the space left for 
pedestrians to pass through the crowd. 
To
the rear they were lined up two deep 
before the store windows. Before me
the listeners merged in a green-tinted 
gloom. The Exhorter gestured violently,
blasting the Brotherhood.

"The time for ahction is here. We mahst 
chase them out of Harlem,"
he cried. And for a second I thought he 
had caught me in the sweep of his
eyes, and tensed.
"Ras said chase them! It is time Ras 
the Exhorter become Ras the
DESTROYER!"
Shouts of agreement arose and I looked 
behind me, seeing the men
who had followed me and thinking, What 
did he mean, destroyer?
"I repeat, black ladies and gentlemahn, 
the time has come for
ahction! I, Ras the Destroyer, repeat, 
the time has come!"
I trembled with excitement; they hadn't 
recognized me. It works, I
thought. They see the hat, not me. 
There is a magic in it. It hides me 
right
in front of their eyes . . . But 
suddenly I wasn't sure. With Ras 
calling for
the destruction of everything white in 
Harlem, who could notice me? I needed
a better test. If I was to carry out my 
plan . . . What plan? Hell, I don't
know, come on . . .
I weaved out of the crowd and left, 
heading for Hambro's.
A group of zoot-suiters greeted me in 
passing. "Hey now, daddy-o,"
they called. "Hey now!"
"Hey now!" I said.
It was as though by dressing and 
walking in a certain way I had
enlisted in a fraternity in which I was 
recognized at a glance -- not by
features, but by clothes, by uniform, 
by gait. But this gave rise to another
uncertainty. I was not a zoot-suiter, 
but a kind of politician. Or was I? What
would happen in a real test? What about 
the fellows who'd been so insulting
at the Jolly Dollar? I was halfway 
across Eighth Avenue at the thought and
retraced my steps, running for an 
uptown bus.
There were many of the regular 
customers draped around the bar.
The room was crowded and Barrelhouse 
was on duty. I could feel the frame
of the glasses cutting into the ridge 
of my nose as I tilted my hat and
squeezed up to the bar. Barrelhouse 
looked at me roughly, his lips pushed
out.
"What brand you drinking tonight, 
Poppa-stopper?" he said.
"Make it Ballantine's," I said in my 
natural voice.
I watched his eyes as he set the beer 
before me and slapped the bar
with his enormous hand for his money. 
Then, my heart beating faster, I

made my old gesture of payment, 
spinning the coin upon the bar and 
waited.
The coin disappeared into his fist.
"Thanks, pops," he said, moving on and 
leaving me puzzled. For
there had been recognition of a kind in 
his voice but not for me. He never
called me "pops" or "poppa-stopper." 
It's working, I thought, perhaps it's
working very well.
Certainly something was working on me, 
and profoundly. Still I was
relieved. It was hot. Perhaps that was 
it. I drank the cold beer, looking back
to the rear of the room to the booths. 
A crowd of men and women moiled
like nightmare figures in the 
smoke-green haze. The juke box was 
dinning
and it was like looking into the depths 
of a murky cave. And now someone
moved aside and looking down along the 
curve of the bar past the bobbing
heads and shoulders I saw the juke box, 
lit up like a bad dream of the Fiery
Furnace, shouting:
Jelly, Jelly
Jelly,
All night long.
And yet, I thought, watching a numbers 
runner paying off a bet, this
is one place that the Brotherhood 
definitely penetrated. Let Hambro 
explain
that, too, along with all the rest he'd 
have to explain.
I drained the glass and turned to 
leave, when there across at the
lunch counter I saw Brother Maceo. I 
moved impulsively, forgetting my
disguise until almost upon him, then 
checked myself and put my disguise
once more to a test. Reaching roughly 
across his shoulder I picked up a
greasy menu that rested between the 
sugar shaker and the hot-sauce bottle
and pretended to read it through my 
dark lenses.
"How're the ribs, pops?" I said.
"Fine, least these here I'm eatin' is."
"Yeah? How much you know about ribs?"
He raised his head slowly, looking 
across at the spitted chickens
revolving before the low blue 
rotisserie flames. "I reckon I know as 
much
about 'em as you," he said, "and 
probably more, since I probably been 
eatin'
'em a few years longer than you, and in 
a few more places. What makes you

think you kin come in here messing with 
me anyhow?"
He turned, looking straight into my 
face now, challenging me. He
was very game and I wanted to laugh.
"Oh, take it easy," I growled. "A man 
can ask a question, can't he?"
"You got your answer," he said, turning 
completely around on the
stool. "So now I guess you ready to 
pull your knife."
"Knife?" I said, wanting to laugh. "Who 
said anything about a knife?"
"That's what you thinking about. 
Somebody say something you don't
like and you kinda fellows pull your 
switch blades. So all right, go ahead 
and
pull it. I'm as ready to die as I'm 
gon' ever be. Let's see you, go ahead!"
He reached for the sugar shaker now, 
and I stood there feeling
suddenly that the old man before me was 
not Brother Maceo at all, but
someone else disguised to confuse me. 
The glasses were working too well.
He's a game old brother, I thought, but 
this'll never do.
I pointed toward his plate. "I asked 
you about the ribs," I said, "not
your ribs. Who said anything about a 
knife?"
"Never mind that, just go on and pull 
it," he said.
"Let's see you. Or is you waiting for 
me to turn my back. All right,
here it is, here's my back," he said, 
turning swiftly on the stool and around
again, his arm set to throw the shaker.
Customers were turning to look, were 
moving clear.
"What's the matter, Maceo?" someone 
said.
"Nothing I caint handle; this 
confidencing sonofabitch come in here
bluffing --"
"You take it easy, old man," I said. 
"Don't let your mouth get your
head in trouble," thinking, Why am I 
talking like this?
"You don't have to worry about that, 
sonofabitch, pull your switch
blade!"
"Give it to him, Maceo, coolcrack the 
motherfouler!"
I marked the position of the voice by 
ear now, turning so that I
could see Maceo, the agitator, and the 
customers blocking the door. Even the
juke box had stopped and I could feel 
the danger mounting so swiftly that I
moved without thinking, bounding over 
quickly and sweeping up a beer
bottle, my body trembling.
"All right," I said, "if that's the way 
you want it, all right! The next

one who talks out of turn gets this!"
Maceo moved and I feinted with the 
bottle, seeing him dodge, his
arm set to throw and held only because 
I was crowding him; a dark old man
in overalls and a gray long-billed 
cloth cap, who looked dreamlike through
the green glasses.
"Throw it," I said. "Go on," overcome 
with the madness of the thing.
Here I'd set out to test a disguise on 
a friend and now I was ready to beat
him to his knees -- not because I 
wanted to but because of place and
circumstance. Okay, okay, it was absurd 
and yet real and dangerous and if he
moved, I'd let him have it as brutally 
as possible. To protect myself I'd have
to, or the drunks would gang me. Maceo 
was set, looking at me coldly, and
suddenly I heard a voice boom out, 
"Ain't going to be no fighting in my
joint!" It was Barrelhouse. "Put them 
things down y'all, they cost money."
"Hell, Barrelhouse, let 'em fight!"
"They can fight in the streets, not in 
here -- Hey, y'all," he called
"look over here . . ."
I saw him now, leaning forward with a 
pistol in his huge fist, resting
it steady upon the bar.
"Now put 'em down y'all," he said 
mournfully. "I done ask you to
put my property down."
Brother Maceo looked from me to 
Barrelhouse.
"Put it down, old man," I said, 
thinking, Why am I acting from pride
when this is not really me?
"You put yourn down," he said.
"Both of y'all put 'em down; and you, 
Rinehart," Barrelhouse said,
gesturing at me with his pistol, "you 
get out of my joint and stay out. We
don't need your money in here."
I started to protest, but he held up 
his palm.
"Now you all right with me, Rinehart, 
don't get me wrong. But I just
can't stand trouble," Barrelhouse said.
Brother Maceo had replaced the shaker 
now and I put my bottle
down and backed to the door.
"And Rine," Barrelhouse said, "don't go 
try to pull no pistol neither,
'cause this here one is loaded and I 
got a permit."
I backed to the door, my scalp 
prickling, watching them both.

"Next time don't ask no questions you 
don't want answered," Maceo
called. "An' if you ever want to finish 
this argument I be right here."
I felt the outside air explode around 
me and I stood just beyond the
door laughing with the sudden relief of 
the joke restored, looking back at the
defiant old man in his long-billed cap 
and the confounded eyes of the crowd.
Rinehart, Rinehart, I thought, what 
kind of man is Rinehart?
I was still chuckling when, in the next 
block, I waited for the traffic
lights near a group of men who stood on 
the corner passing a bottle of
cheap wine between them as they 
discussed Clifton's murder.
"What we need is some guns," one of 
them said. "An eye for an
eye."
"Hell yes, machine guns. Pass me the 
sneakypete, Muckleroy."
"Wasn't for that Sullivan Law this here 
New York wouldn't be
nothing but a shooting gallery," 
another man said.
"Here's the sneakypete, and don't try 
to find no home in that bottle."
"It's the only home I got, Muckleroy. 
You want to take that away
from me?"
"Man, drink up and pass the damn 
bottle."
I started around them, hearing one of 
them say, "What you saying,
Mr. Rinehart, how's your hammer 
hanging?"
Even up here, I thought, beginning to 
hurry. "Heavy, man," I said,
knowing the answer to that one, "very 
heavy." They laughed.
"Well, it'll be lighter by morning."
"Say, look ahere, Mr. Rinehart, how 
about giving me a job?" one of
them said, approaching me, and I waved 
and crossed the street, walking
rapidly down Eighth toward the next bus 
stop.
The shops and groceries were dark now, 
and children were running
and yelling along the walks, dodging in 
and out among the adults. I walked,
struck by the merging fluidity of forms 
seen through the lenses. Could this be
the way the world appeared to Rinehart? 
All the dark-glass boys? "For now
we see as through a glass darkly but 
then -- but then --" I couldn't
remember the rest.
She was carrying a shopping bag and 
moved gingerly on her feet.
Until she touched my arm I thought that 
she was talking to herself.
"I say, pardon me, son, look like you 
trying to pass on by me

tonight. What's the final figger?"
"Figure? What figure?"
"Now you know what I mean," she said, 
her voice rising as she put
her hands on her hips and looked 
forward. "I mean today's last number. 
Ain't
you Rine the runner?"
"Rine the runner?"
"Yas, Rinehart the number man. Who you 
trying to fool?"
"But that's not my name, madame," I 
said, speaking as precisely as I
could and stepping away from her. 
"You've made a mistake."
Her mouth fell wide. "You ain't? Well, 
why you look so much like
him?" she said with hot doubt in her 
voice. "Now, ain't this here something.
Let me get on home; if my dream come 
out, I'm-a have to go look that
rascal up. And here I needs that money 
too."
"I hope you won," I said, straining to 
see her clearly, "and I hope he
pays off."
"Thanks, son, but he'll pay off all 
right. I can see you ain't Rinehart
now though. I'm sorry for stopping you."
"It's all right," I said.
"If I'd looked at your shoes I woulda 
known --"
"Why?"
" 'Cause Rine the runner is known for 
them knobtoed kind."
I watched her limp away, rocking like 
the Old Ship of Zion. No
wonder everyone knows him, I thought, 
in that racket you have to get
around. I was aware of my 
black-and-white shoes for the first 
time since the
day of Clifton's shooting.
When the squad car veered close to the 
curb and rolled along slowly
beside me I knew what was coming before 
the cop opened his mouth.
"That you, Rinehart, my man?" the cop 
who was not driving said. He
was white. I could see the shield 
gleaming on his cap but the number was
vague.
"Not this time, officer," I said.
"The hell you say; what're you trying 
to pull? Is this a holdout?"
"You're making a mistake," I said. "I'm 
not Rinehart."
The car stopped, a flashlight beamed in 
my green-lensed eyes. He
spat into the street. "Well, you better 
be by morning," he said, "and you

better have our cut in the regular 
place. Who the hell you think you are?" 
he
called as the car speeded up and away.
And before I could turn a crowd of men 
ran up from the corner
pool hall. One of them carried an 
automatic in his hand.
"What were those sonsabitches trying to 
do to you, daddy?" he said.
"It was nothing, they thought I was 
someone else."
"Who'd they take you for?"
I looked at them -- were they criminals 
or simply men who were
worked up over the shooting?
"Some guy named Rinehart," I said.
"Rinehart -- Hey, y'all hear that?" 
snorted the fellow with the gun.
"Rinehart! Them paddies must be going 
stone blind. Anybody can see you
ain't Rinehart."
"But he do look like Rine," another man 
said, staring at me with his
hands in his trousers pockets.
"Like hell he does."
"Hell, man, Rinehart would be driving 
that Cadillac this time of
night. What the hell you talking about?"
"Listen, Jack," the fellow with the gun 
said, "don't let nobody make
you act like Rinehart. You got to have 
a smooth tongue, a heartless heart and
be ready to do anything. But if them 
paddies bother you agin, just let us
know. We aim to stop some of this 
head-whupping they been doing."
"Sure," I said.
"Rinehart," he said again. "Ain't that 
a bitch?"
They turned and went arguing back to 
the pool hall and I hurried
out of the neighborhood. Having 
forgotten Hambro for the moment I walked
east instead of west. I wanted to 
remove the glasses but decided against 
it.
Ras's men might still be on the prowl.
It was quieter now. No one paid me any 
special attention, although
the street was alive with pedestrians, 
all moiling along in the mysterious tint
of green. Perhaps I'm out of his 
territory at last, I thought and began 
trying
to place Rinehart in the scheme of 
things. He's been around all the while,
but I have been looking in another 
direction. He was around and others like
him, but I had looked past him until 
Clifton's death (or was it Ras?) had
made me aware. What on earth was hiding 
behind the face of things? If dark

glasses and a white hat could blot out 
my identity so quickly, who actually
was who?
The perfume was exotic and seemed to 
roll up the walk behind me
as I became aware of a woman strolling 
casually behind me.
"I've been waiting for you to recognize 
me, daddy," a voice said. "I've
been waiting for you a long time."
It was a pleasant voice with a slightly 
husky edge and plenty of sleep
in it.
"Don't you hear me, daddy?" she said. 
And I started to look around,
hearing, "No, daddy, don't look back; 
my old man might be cold trailing me.
Just walk along beside me while I tell 
you where to meet me. I swear I
thought you'd never come. Will you be 
able to see me tonight?"
She had moved close to me now and 
suddenly I felt a hand fumbling
at my jacket pocket.
"All right, daddy, you don't have to 
jump evil on me, here it is; now
will you see me?"
I stopped dead, grabbing her hand and 
looking at her, an exotic girl
even through the green glasses, looking 
at me with a smile that suddenly
broke. "Rinehart, daddy, what's the 
matter?"
So here it goes again, I thought, 
holding her tightly.
"I'm not Rinehart, Miss," I said. "And 
for the first time tonight I'm
truly sorry."
"But Bliss, daddy -- Rinehart! You're 
not trying to put your baby
down -- Daddy, what did I do?"
She seized my arm and we were poised 
face to face in the middle of
the walk. And suddenly she screamed, 
"Oooooooh! You really aren't! And me
trying to give you his money. Get away 
from me, you dumb John. Get away
from me!"
I backed off. Her face was distorted as 
she stamped her high heels
and screamed. Behind me I heard someone 
say, "Hey, what was that?"
followed by the sound of running feet 
as I shot off and around the corner
away from her screams. That lovely 
girl, I thought, that lovely girl.
Several blocks away I stopped, out of 
breath. And both pleased and
angry. How stupid could people be? Was 
everyone suddenly nuts? I looked
about me. It was a bright street, the 
walks full of people. I stood at the 
curb

trying to breathe. Up the street a sign 
with a cross glowed above the walk:
HOLY WAY STATION
BEHOLD THE LIVING GOD
The letters glowed dark green and I 
wondered if it were from the lenses or
the actual color of the neon tubes. A 
couple of drunks stumbled past. I
headed for Hambro's, passing a man 
sitting on the curb with his head bent
over his knees. Cars passed. I went on. 
Two solemn-faced children came
passing out handbills which first I 
refused, then went back and took. After
all, I had to know what was going on in 
the community. I took the bill and
stepped close to the street light, 
reading.

I dropped the leaflet into the gutter 
and moved on. I walked slowly,
my breath still coming hard. Could it 
be? Soon I reached the sign. It hung
above a store that had been converted 
into a church, and I stepped into the
shallow lobby and wiped my face with a 
handkerchief. Behind me I heard the
rise and fall of an old-fashioned 
prayer such as I hadn't heard since 
leaving
the campus; and then only when visiting 
country preachers were asked to
pray.

The

voice

rose

and

fell

in

a

rhythmical,

dreamlike

recital-part

enumeration of earthly trials undergone 
by the congregation, part rapt display
of vocal virtuosity, part appeal to 
God. I was still wiping my face and
squinting at crude Biblical scenes 
painted on the windows when two old
ladies came up to me.
"Even', Rever'n Rinehart," one of them 
said. "How's our dear pastor
this warm evening?"
Oh, no, I thought, but perhaps agreeing 
will cause less trouble than
denying, and I said, "Good evening, 
sisters," muffling my voice with my
handkerchief and catching the odor of 
the girl's perfume from my hand.
"This here's Sister Harris, Rever'n. 
She come to join our little band."
"God bless you, Sister Harris," I said, 
taking her extended hand.
"You know, Rever'n, I once heard you 
preach years ago. You was just
a lil' ole twelve-year-old boy, back in 
Virginia. And here I come North and
find you, praise God, still preaching 
the gospel, doing the Lord's work. Still
preaching the ole time religion here in 
this wicked city --"
"Er, Sister Harris," the other sister 
said, "we better get on in and
find our seats. Besides, the pastor's 
kind of got things to do. Though you are
here a little early, aren't you, 
Rever'n?"
"Yes," I said, dabbing my mouth with my 
handkerchief. They were
motherly old women of the southern type 
and I suddenly felt a nameless
despair. I wanted to tell them that 
Rinehart was a fraud, but now there came
a shout from inside the church and I 
heard a burst of music.
"Just lissen to it, Sister Harris. 
That's the new kind of guitar music I
told you Rever'n Rinehart got for us. 
Ain't it heavenly?"
"Praise God," Sister Harris said. 
"Praise God!"

"Excuse us, Rever'n, I have to see 
Sister Judkins about the money
she collected for the building fund. 
And, Rever'n, last night I sold ten
recordings of your inspiring sermon. 
Even sold one to the white lady I work
for."
"Bless you," I found myself saying in a 
voice heavy with despair,
"bless you, bless you."
Then the door opened and I looked past 
their heads into a small
crowded room of men and women sitting 
in folding chairs, to the front where
a slender woman in a rusty black robe 
played passionate boogie-woogie on an
upright piano along with a young man 
wearing a skull cap who struck
righteous riffs from an electric guitar 
which was connected to an amplifier
that hung from the ceiling above a 
gleaming white and gold pulpit. A man in
an elegant red cardinal's robe and a 
high lace collar stood resting against 
an
enormous Bible and now began to lead a 
hard-driving hymn which the
congregation shouted in the unknown 
tongue. And back and high on the wall
above him there arched the words in 
letters of gold:
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
The whole scene quivered vague and 
mysterious in the green light,
then the door closed and the sound 
muted down.
It was too much for me. I removed my 
glasses and tucked the white
hat carefully beneath my arm and walked 
away. Can it be, I thought, can it
actually be? And I knew that it was. I 
had heard of it before but I'd never
come so close. Still, could he be all 
of them: Rine the runner and Rine the
gambler and Rine the briber and Rine 
the lover and Rinehart the Reverend?
Could he himself be both rind and 
heart? What is real anyway? But how
could I doubt it? He was a broad man, a 
man of parts who got around.
Rinehart the rounder. It was true as I 
was true. His world was possibility
and he knew it. He was years ahead of 
me and I was a fool. I must have
been crazy and blind. The world in 
which we lived was without boundaries. A
vast seething, hot world of fluidity, 
and Rine the rascal was at home. Perhaps
only Rine the rascal was at home in it. 
It was unbelievable, but perhaps only
the unbelievable could be believed. 
Perhaps the truth was always a lie.
Perhaps, I thought, the whole thing 
should roll off me like drops of

water rolling off Jack's glass eye. I 
should search out the proper political
classification, label Rinehart and his 
situation and quickly forget it. I 
hurried
away from the church so swiftly that I 
found myself back at the office before
I remembered that I was going to 
Hambro's.
I was both depressed and fascinated. I 
wanted to know Rinehart and
yet, I thought, I'm upset because I 
know I don't have to know him, that
simply becoming aware of his existence, 
being mistaken for him, is enough to
convince me that Rinehart is real. It 
couldn't be, but it is. And it can be, 
is,
simply because it's unknown. Jack 
wouldn't dream of such a possibility, 
nor
Tobitt, who thinks he's so close. Too 
little was known, too much was in the
dark. I thought of Clifton and of Jack 
himself; how much was really known
about either of them? How much was 
known about me? Who from my old
life had challenged me? And after all 
this time I had just discovered Jack's
missing eye.
My entire body started to itch, as 
though I had just been removed
from a plaster cast and was unused to 
the new freedom of movement. In the
South everyone knew you, but coming 
North was a jump into the unknown.
How many days could you walk the 
streets of the big city without
encountering anyone who knew you, and 
how many nights? You could
actually make yourself anew. The notion 
was frightening, for now the world
seemed to flow before my eyes. All 
boundaries down, freedom was not only
the recognition of necessity, it was 
the recognition of possibility. And 
sitting
there trembling I caught a brief 
glimpse of the possibilities posed by
Rinehart's multiple personalities and 
turned away. It was too vast and
confusing to contemplate. Then I looked 
at the polished lenses of the glasses
and laughed. I had been trying simply 
to turn them into a disguise but they
had become a political instrument 
instead; for if Rinehart could use them 
in
his work, no doubt I could use them in 
mine. It was too simple, and yet
they had already opened up a new 
section of reality for me. What would 
the
committee say about that? What did 
their theory tell them of such a world? 
I
recalled a report of a shoeshine boy 
who had encountered the best treatment
in the South simply by wearing a white 
turban instead of his usual Dobbs or
Stetson, and I fell into a fit of 
laughing. Jack would be outraged at the 
very
suggestion of such a state of things. 
And yet there was truth in it; this was
the real chaos which he thought he was 
describing -- so long ago it seemed

now . . . Outside the Brotherhood we 
were outside history; but inside of it
they didn't see us. It was a hell of a 
state of affairs, we were nowhere. I
wanted to back away from it, but still 
I wanted to discuss it, to consult
someone who'd tell me it was only a 
brief, emotional illusion. I wanted the
props put back beneath the world. So 
now I had a real need to see Hambro.
Getting up to go, I looked at the wall 
map and laughed at Columbus.
What an India he'd found! I was almost 
across the hall when I remembered
and came back and put on the hat and 
glasses. I'd need them to carry me
through the streets.
I took a cab. Hambro lived in the West 
Eighties, and once in the
vestibule I tucked the hat under my arm 
and put the glasses in my pocket
along with Brother Tarp's leg chain and 
Clifton's doll. My pocket was getting
overloaded.
I was shown into a small, book-lined 
study by Hambro himself. From
another part of the apartment came a 
child's voice singing Humpty Dumpty,
awakening humiliating memories of my 
first Easter program during which I
had stood before the church audience 
and forgotten the words . . .
"My kid," Hambro said, "filibustering 
against going to bed. A real sea
lawyer, that kid."
The child was singing Hickory Dickory 
Dock, very fast, as Hambro
shut the door. He was saying something 
about the child and I looked at him
with sudden irritation. With Rinehart 
on my mind, why had I come here?
Hambro was so tall that when he crossed 
his legs both feet touched
the floor. He had been my teacher 
during my period of indoctrination and
now I realized that I shouldn't have 
come. Hambro's lawyer's mind was too
narrowly logical. He'd see Rinehart 
simply as a criminal, my obsession as a
fall into pure mysticism . . . You'd 
better hope that is the way he'll see 
it, I
thought. Then I decided to ask him 
about conditions uptown and leave . . .
"Look, Brother Hambro," I said, "what's 
to be done about my
district?"
He looked at me with a dry smile. "Have 
I become one of those
bores who talk too much about their 
children?"
"Oh, no, it's not that," I said. "I've 
had a hard day. I'm nervous.
With Clifton's death and things in the 
district so bad, I guess . . ."
"Of course," he said, still smiling, 
"but why are you worried about

the district?"
"Because things are getting out of 
hand. Ras's men tried to rough me
up tonight and our strength is steadily 
going to hell."
"That's regrettable," he said, "but 
there's nothing to be done about it
that wouldn't upset the larger plan. 
It's unfortunate, Brother, but your
members will have to be sacrificed."
The distant child had stopped singing 
now, and it was dead quiet. I
looked at the angular composure ot his 
face searching for the sincerity in his
words. I could feel some deep change. 
It was as though my discovery of
Rinehart had opened a gulf between us 
over which, though we sat within
touching distance, our voices barely 
carried and then fell flat, without an
echo. I tried to shake it away, but 
still the distance, so great that 
neither
could grasp the emotional tone of the 
other, remained.
"Sacrifice?" my voice said. "You say 
that very easily."
"Just the same, though, all who leave 
must be considered expendable.
The new directives must be followed 
rigidly."
It sounded unreal, an antiphonal game. 
"But why?" I said. "Why
must the directives be changed in my 
district when the old methods are
needed -- especially now?" Somehow I 
couldn't get the needed urgency into
my words, and beneath it all something 
about Rinehart bothered me, darted
just beneath the surface of my mind; 
something that had to do with me
intimately.
"It's simple, Brother," Hambro was 
saying. "We are making temporary
alliances with other political groups 
and the interests of one group of 
brothers
must be sacrificed to that ot the 
whole."
"Why wasn't I told of this?" I said.
"You will be, in time, by the committee 
-- Sacrifice is necessary now
--"
"But shouldn't sacrifice be made 
willingly by those who know what
they are doing? My people don't 
understand why they're being sacrificed.
They don't even know they're being 
sacrificed -- at least not by us . . ." 
But
what, my mind went on, if they're as 
willing to be duped by the Brotherhood
as by Rinehart?
I sat up at the thought and there must 
have been an odd expression
on my face, for Hambro, who was resting 
his elbows upon the arms of his

chair and touching his fingertips 
together, raised his eyebrows as though
expecting me to continue. Then he said, 
"The disciplined members will
understand."
I pulled Tarp's leg chain from my 
pocket and slipped it over my
knuckles. He didn't notice. "Don't you 
realize that we have only a handful of
disciplined members left? Today the 
funeral brought out hundreds who'll drop
away as soon as they see we're not 
following through. And now we're being
attacked on the streets. Can't you 
understand? Other groups are circulating
petitions, Ras is calling for violence. 
The committee is mistaken if they think
this is going to die down."
He shrugged. "It's a risk which we must 
take. All of us must sacrifice
for the good of the whole. Change is 
achieved through sacrifice. We follow
the laws of reality, so we make 
sacrifices."
"But the community is demanding 
equality of sacrifice," I said.
"We've never asked for special 
treatment."
"It isn't that simple, Brother," he 
said. "We have to protect our gains.
It's inevitable that some must make 
greater sacrifices than others . . ."
"That 'some' being my people . . ."
"In this instance, yes."
"So the weak must sacrifice for the 
strong? Is that it, Brother?"
"No, a part of the whole is sacrificed 
-- and will continue to be until
a new society is formed."
"I don't get it," I said. "I just don't 
get it. We work our hearts out
trying to get the people to follow us 
and just when they do, just when they
see their relationship to events, we 
drop them. I don't see it."
Hambro

smiled

remotely. "We don't

have to

worry

about the

aggressiveness of the Negroes. Not 
during the new period or any other. In
fact, we now have to slow them down for 
their own good. It's a scientific
necessity."
I looked at him, at the long, bony, 
almost Lincolnesque face. I might
have liked him, I thought, he seems to 
be a really kind and sincere man and
yet he can say this to me . . .
"So you really believe that," I said 
quietly.
"With all my integrity," he said.
For a second I thought I'd laugh. Or 
let fly with Tarp's link.

Integrity! He talks to me of integrity! 
I described a circle in the air. I'd 
tried
to build my integrity upon the role of 
Brotherhood and now it had changed
to water, air. What was integrity? What 
did it have to do with a world in
which Rinehart was possible and 
successful?
"But what's changed?" I said. "Wasn't I 
brought in to arouse their
aggressiveness?" My voice fell sad, 
hopeless.
"For that particular period," Hambro 
said, leaning a little forward.
"Only for that period."
"And what will happen now?" I said.
He blew a smoke ring, the blue-gray 
circle rising up boiling within
its own jetting form, hovering for an 
instant then disintegrating into a
weaving strand.
"Cheer up!" he said. "We shall 
progress. Only now they must be
brought along more slowly . . ."
How would he look through the green 
lenses? I thought, saying, "Are
you sure you're not saying that they 
must be held back?"
He chuckled. "Now, listen," he said. 
"Don't stretch me on a rack of
dialectic. I'm a brother."
"You mean the brakes must be put on the 
old wheel of history," I
said. "Or is it the little wheels 
within the wheel?"
His face sobered. "I mean only that 
they must be brought along
more slowly. They can't be allowed to 
upset the tempo of the master plan.
Timing is all important. Besides, you 
still have a job to do, only now it will
be more educational."
"And what about the shooting?"
"Those who are dissatisfied will drop 
away and those who remain
you'll teach . . ."
"I don't think I can," I said.
"Why? It's just as important."
"Because they are against us; besides, 
I'd feel like Rinehart . . ." It
slipped out and he looked at me.
"Like who?"
"Like a charlatan," I said.
Hambro laughed. "I thought you had 
learned about that, Brother."
I looted at him quickly. "Learned what?"

"That it's impossible not to take 
advantage of the people."
"That's Rinehartism -- cynicism . . ."
"What?"
"Cynicism," I said.
"Not cynicism -- realism. The trick is 
to take advantage of them in
their own best interest."
I sat forward in my chair, suddenly 
conscious of the unreality of the
conversation. "But who is to judge? 
Jack? The committee?"
"We judge through cultivating 
scientific objectivity," he said with a
voice that had a smile in it, and 
suddenly I saw the hospital machine, 
felt as
though locked in again.
"Don't kid yourself," I said. "The only 
scientific objectivity is a
machine."
"Discipline, not machinery," he said. 
"We're scientists. We must take
the risks of our science and our will 
to achieve. Would you like to resurrect
God to take responsibility?" He shook 
his head. "No, Brother, we have to
make such decisions ourselves. Even if 
we must sometimes appear as
charlatans."
"You're in for some surprises," I said.
"Maybe so and maybe not," he said. "At 
any rate, through our very
position in the vanguard we must do and 
say the things necessary to get the
greatest number of the people to move 
toward what is for their own good."
Suddenly I couldn't stand it.
"Look at me! Look at me!" I said. 
"Everywhere I've turned somebody
has wanted to sacrifice me for my good 
-- only they were the ones who
benefited. And now we start on the old 
sacrificial merry-go-round. At what
point do we stop? Is this the new true 
definition, is Brotherhood a matter of
sacrificing the weak? If so, at what 
point do we stop?"
Hambro looked as though I were not 
there. "At the proper moment
science will stop us. And of course we 
as individuals must sympathetically
debunk ourselves. Even though it does 
only a little good. But then," he
shrugged, "if you go too far in that 
direction you can't pretend to lead. 
You'll
lose your confidence. You won't believe 
enough in your own correctness to
lead others. You must therefore have 
confidence in those who lead you -- in
the collective wisdom of Brotherhood."

I left in a worse state than that in 
which I'd come. Several buildings
away I heard him call behind me, 
watched him approach through the dark.
"You left your hat," he said, handing 
it to me along with the
mimeographed sheets of instructions 
outlining the new program. I looked at
the hat and at him, thinking of 
Rinehart and invisibility, but knew 
that for
him it would have no reality. I told 
him good night and went through the
hot street to Central Park West, 
starting toward Harlem.
Sacrifice and leadership, I thought. 
For him it was simple. For them
it was simple. But hell, I was both. 
Both sacrificer and victim. I couldn't 
get
away from that, and Hambro didn't have 
to deal with it. That was reality too,
my reality. He didn't have to put the 
knife blade to his own throat. What
would he say if he were the victim?
I walked along the park in the dark. 
Cars passed. From time to time
the sound of voices, squealing 
laughter, arose from beyond the trees 
and
hedges. I could smell the sun-singed 
grass. The sky against which an airplane
beacon played was still overcast. I 
thought of Jack, the people at the 
funeral,
Rinehart. They'd asked us for bread and 
the best I could give was a glass eye
-- not so much as an electric guitar.
I stopped and dropped to a bench. I 
should leave, I thought. That
would be the honest thing to do. 
Otherwise I could only tell them to have
hope and try to hold on to those who'd 
listen. Was that also what Rinehart
was, a principle of hope for which they 
gladly paid? Otherwise there was
nothing but betrayal, and that meant 
going back to serve Bledsoe, and
Emerson, jumping from the pot of 
absurdity to the fire of the 
ridiculous. And
either was a self-betrayal. But I 
couldn't leave; I had to settle with 
Jack and
Tobitt. I owed it to Clifton and Tarp 
and the others. I had to hold on ... and
then I had an idea that shook me 
profoundly: You don't have to worry 
about
the people. If they tolerate Rinehart, 
then they will forget it and even with
them you are invisible. It lasted only 
the fraction of a second and I rejected
it immediately; still it had flashed 
across the dark sky of my mind. It was
just like that. It didn't matter 
because they didn't realize just what 
had
happened, neither my hope nor my 
failure. My ambition and integrity were
nothing to them and my failure was as 
meaningless as Clifton's. It had been
that way all along. Only in the 
Brotherhood had there seemed a chance 
for
such as us, the mere glimmer of a 
light, but behind the polished and 
humane

fa?de of Jack's eye I'd found an 
amorphous form and a harsh red rawness.
And even that was without meaning 
except for me.
Well, I was and yet I was invisible, 
that was the fundamental
contradiction. I was and yet I was 
unseen. It was frightening and as I sat
there I sensed another frightening 
world of possibilities. For now I saw 
that I
could agree with Jack without agreeing. 
And I could tell Harlem to have hope
when there was no hope. Perhaps I could 
tell them to hope until I found the
basis of something real, some firm 
ground for action that would lead them
onto the plane of history. But until 
then I would have to move them without
myself being moved . . . I'd have to do 
a Rinehart.
I leaned against a stone wall along the 
park, thinking of Jack and
Hambro and of the day's events and 
shook with rage. It was all a swindle, 
an
obscene swindle! They had set 
themselves up to describe the world. 
What did
they know of us, except that we 
numbered so many, worked on certain 
jobs,
offered so many votes, and provided so 
many marchers for some protest
parade of theirs! I leaned there, 
aching to humiliate them, to refute 
them.
And now all past humiliations became 
precious parts of my experience, and
for the first time, leaning against 
that stone wall in the sweltering 
night, I
began to accept my past and, as I 
accepted it, I felt memories welling up
within me. It was as though I'd learned 
suddenly to look around corners;
images of past humiliations flickered 
through my head and I saw that they
were more than separate experiences. 
They were me; they defined me. I was
my experiences and my experiences were 
me, and no blind men, no matter
how powerful they became, even if they 
conquered the world, could take that,
or change one single itch, taunt, 
laugh, cry, scar, ache, rage or pain of 
it.
They were blind, bat blind, moving only 
by the echoed sounds of their own
voices. And because they were blind 
they would destroy themselves and I'd
help them. I laughed. Here I had 
thought they accepted me because they 
felt
that color made no difference, when in 
reality it made no difference because
they didn't see either color or men . . 
. For all they were concerned, we were
so many names scribbled on fake 
ballots, to be used at their 
convenience and
when not needed to be filed away. It 
was a joke, an absurd joke. And now I
looked around a corner of my mind and 
saw Jack and Norton and Emerson
merge into one single white figure. 
They were very much the same, each
attempting to force his picture of 
reality upon me and neither giving a 
hoot

in hell for how things looked to me. I 
was simply a material, a natural
resource to be used. I had switched 
from the arrogant absurdity of Norton
and Emerson to that of Jack and the 
Brotherhood, and it all came out the
same -- except I now recognized my 
invisibility.
So I'd accept it, I'd explore it, rine 
and heart. I'd plunge into it with
both feet and they'd gag. Oh, but 
wouldn't they gag. I didn't know what my
grandfather had meant, but I was ready 
to test his advice. I'd overcome them
with yeses, undermine them with grins, 
I'd agree them to death and
destruction. Yes, and I'd let them 
swallow me until they vomited or burst
wide open. Let them gag on what they 
refused to see. Let them choke on it.
That was one risk they hadn't 
calculated. That was a risk they had 
never
dreamt of in their philosophy. Nor did 
they know that they could discipline
themselves to destruction, that saying 
"yes" could destroy them. Oh, I'd yes
them, but wouldn't I yes them! I'd yes 
them till they puked and rolled in it.
All they wanted of me was one belch of 
affirmation and I'd bellow it out
loud. Yesl Yes! YES! That was all 
anyone wanted of us, that we should be
heard and not seen, and then heard only 
in one big optimistic chorus of
yassuh, yassuh, yassuh! All right, I'd 
yea, yea and oui, oui and si, si and 
see,
see them too; and I'd walk around in 
their guts with hobnailed boots. Even
those super-big shots whom I'd never 
seen at committee meetings. They
wanted a machine? Very well, I'd become 
a supersensitive confirmer of their
misconceptions, and just to hold their 
confidence I'd try to be right part of
the time. Oh, I'd serve them well and 
I'd make invisibility felt if not seen,
and they'd learn that it could be as 
polluting as a decaying body, or a piece
of bad meat in a stew. And if I got 
hurt? Very well again. Besides, didn't
they believe in sacrifice? They were 
the subtle thinkers -- would this be
treachery? Did the word apply to an 
invisible man? Could they recognize
choice in that which wasn't seen . . . ?
The more I thought of it the more I 
fell into a kind of morbid
fascination with the possibility. Why 
hadn't I discovered it sooner? How
different my life might have been! How 
terribly different! Why hadn't I seen
the possibilities? If a sharecropper 
could attend college by working during 
the
summers as a waiter and factory hand or 
as a musician and then graduate to
become a doctor, why couldn't all those 
things be done at one and the same
time? And wasn't that old slave a 
scientist -- or at least called one,

recognized as one -- even when he stood 
with hat in hand, bowing and
scraping in senile and obscene 
servility? My God, what possibilities 
existed!
And that spiral business, that progress 
goo! Who knew all the secrets; hadn't
I changed my name and never been 
challenged even once? And that lie that
success was a rising upward. What a 
crummy lie they kept us dominated by.
Not only could you travel upward toward 
success but you could travel
downward as well; up and down, in 
retreat as well as in advance, crabways
and crossways and around in a circle, 
meeting your old selves coming and
going and perhaps all at the same time. 
How could I have missed it for so
long? Hadn't I grown up around 
gambler-politicians, bootlegger-judges 
and
sheriffs who were burglars; yes, and 
Klansmen who were preachers and
members of humanitarian societies? 
Hell, and hadn't Bledsoe tried to tell 
me
what it was all about? I felt more dead 
than alive. It had been quite a day;
one that could not have been more 
shattering even if I had learned that 
the
man whom I'd always called father was 
actually of no relation to me.
I went to the apartment and fell across 
the bed in my clothes. It was
hot and the fan did little more than 
stir the heat in heavy leaden waves,
beneath which I lay twirling the dark 
glasses and watching the hypnotic
flickering of the lenses as I tried to 
make plans. I would hide my anger and
lull them to sleep; assure them that 
the community was in full agreement
with their program. And as proof I 
would falsify the attendance records by
filling out membership cards with 
fictitious names -- all unemployed, of
course, so as to avoid any question of 
dues. Yes, and I would move about the
community by night and during times of 
danger by wearing the white hat
and the dark glasses. It was a dreary 
prospect but a means of destroying
them, at least in Harlem. I saw no 
possibility of organizing a splinter
movement, for what would be the next 
step? Where would we go? There were
no allies with whom we could join as 
equals; nor were there time or theorists
available to work out an over-all 
program of our own -- although I felt 
that
somewhere between Rinehart and 
invisibility there were great 
potentialities.
But we had no money, no intelligence 
apparatus, either in government,
business or labor unions; and no 
communications with our own people 
except
through unsympathetic newspapers, a few 
Pullman porters who brought
provincial news from distant cities and 
a group of domestics who reported the
fairly uninteresting private lives of 
their employers. If only we had some 
true

friends, some who saw us as more than 
convenient tools for shaping their
own desires! But to hell with that, I 
thought, I would remain and become a
well-disciplined optimist, and help 
them to go merrily to hell. If I 
couldn't
help them to see the reality of our 
lives I would help them to ignore it 
until
it exploded in their faces.
Only one thing bothered me: Since I now 
knew that their real
objectives were never revealed at 
committee meetings I needed some channel
of intelligence through which I could 
learn what actually guided their
operations. But how? If only I had 
resisted being shifted downtown I would
now have enough support in the 
community to insist that they reveal
themselves. Yes, but if I hadn't been 
shifted, I would still be living in a 
world
of illusion. But now that I had found 
the thread of reality, how could I hold
on? They seemed to have me blocked at 
every turn, forcing me to fight them
in the dark. Finally I tossed the 
glasses across the bed and dropped into 
a
fitful nap during which I relived the 
events of the last few days; except that
instead ot Clifton being lost it was 
myself, and I awoke stale, sweaty and
aware of perfume.
I lay on my stomach, my head resting 
upon the back of my hand
thinking, where is it coming from? And 
just as I caught sight ot the glasses I
remembered grasping Rinehart's girl's 
hand. I lay there unmoving, and she
seemed to perch on the bed, a 
bright-eyed bird with her glossy head 
and ripe
breasts, and I was in a wood afraid to 
frighten the bird away. Then I was
fully awake and the bird gone and the 
girl's image in my mind. What would
have happened if I had led her on, how 
far could I have gone? A desirable
girl like that mixed up with Rinehart. 
And now I sat breathless, asking myself
how Rinehart would have solved the 
problem of information and it came
instantly clear: It called for a woman. 
A wife, a girl friend, or secretary of
one ot the leaders, who would be 
willing to talk freely to me. My mind 
swept
back to early experiences in the 
movement. Little incidents sprang to 
memory,
bringing images of the smiles and 
gestures of certain women met after 
rallies
and at parties: Dancing with Emma at 
the Chthonian; she close, soft against
me and the hot swift focusing of my 
desire and my embarrassment as I
caught sight of Jack holding forth in a 
corner, and Emma holding me tight,
her bound breasts pressing against me, 
looking with that teasing light in her
eyes saying, "Ah, temptation," and my 
desperate grab for a sophisticated reply

and managing only, "Oh, but there's 
always temptation," surprising myself
nevertheless and hearing her laughing, 
"Touche! Touche! You should come up
and fence with me some afternoon." That 
had been during the early days
when I had felt strong restrictions and 
resented Emma's boldness and her
opinion that I should have been blacker 
to play my role of Harlem leader.
Well, there were no restrictions left, 
the committee had seen to that. She was
fair game and perhaps she'd find me 
black enough, after all. A committee
meeting was set for tomorrow, and since 
it was Jack's birthday, a party at
the Chthonian would follow. Thus I 
would launch my two-pronged attack
under the most favorable circumstance. 
They were forcing me to Rinehart
methods, so bring on the scientists!

Chapter 24
I started yessing them the next day and 
it began beautifully. The
community was still going apart at the 
seams. Crowds formed at the slightest
incidents. Store windows were smashed 
and several clashes erupted during the
morning between bus drivers and their 
passengers. The papers listed similar
incidents that had exploded during the 
night. The mirrored fa?de of one store
on 125th Street was smashed and I 
passed to see a group of boys watching
their distorted images as they danced 
before the jagged glass. A group of
adults looked on, refusing to move at 
the policemen's command, and
muttering about Clifton. I didn't like 
the look of things, for all my wish to
see the committee confounded.
When I reached the office, members were 
there with reports of
clashes in other parts of the district. 
I didn't like it at all; the violence 
was
pointless and, helped along by Ras, was 
actually being directed against the
community itself. Yet in spite of my 
sense of violated responsibility I was
pleased by the developments and went 
ahead with my plan. I sent out
members to mingle with crowds and try 
to discourage any further violence
and sent an open letter to all the 
press denouncing them for "distorting" 
and

inflating minor incidents.
Late that afternoon at headquarters I 
reported that things were
quieting down and that we were getting 
a large part of the community
interested in a clean-up campaign, 
which would clear all backyards, 
areaways,
and vacant lots of garbage and trash 
and take Harlem's mind off Clifton. It
was such a bareface maneuver that I 
almost lost the confidence of my
invisibility even as I stood before 
them. But they loved it, and when I 
handed
in my fake list of new members they 
responded with enthusiasm. They were
vindicated;

the

program

was

correct,

events

were

progressing

in

their

predetermined direction, history was on 
their side, and Harlem loved them. I
sat there smiling inwardly as I 
listened to the remarks that followed. 
I could
see the role which I was to play as 
plainly as I saw Jack's red hair. 
Incidents
of my past, both recognized and 
ignored, sprang together in my mind in 
an
ironic leap of consciousness that was 
like looking around a corner. I was to
be a justifier, my task would be to 
deny the unpredictable human element of
all Harlem so that they could ignore it 
when it in any way interfered with
their plans. I was to keep ever before 
them the picture of a bright, passive,
good-humored, receptive mass ever 
willing to accept their every scheme. 
When
situations arose in which others would 
respond with righteous anger I would
say that we were calm and unruffled (if 
it suited them to have us angry, then
it was simple enough to create anger 
for us by stating it in their 
propaganda;
the facts were unimportant, unreal); 
and if other people were confused by
their maneuvering I was to reassure 
them that we pierced to the truth with
x-ray insight. If other groups were 
interested in becoming wealthy, I was to
assure the Brothers and the doubting 
members of other districts, that we
rejected wealth as corrupt and 
intrinsically degrading; if other 
minorities loved
the country despite their grievances, I 
would assure the committee that we,
immune to such absurdly human and mixed 
reactions, hated it absolutely;
and, greatest contradiction of all, 
when they denounced the American scene 
as
corrupt and degenerate, I was to say 
that we, though snarled inextricably
within its veins and sinews, were 
miraculously healthy. Yessuh, yessuh!
Though invisible I would be their 
assuring voice of denial; I'd out-Tobitt
Tobitt, and as for that outhouse 
Wrestrum -- well. As I sat there one of 
them
was inflating my faked memberships into 
meanings of national significance.
An illusion was creating a 
counter-illusion. Where would it end? 
Did they

believe their own propaganda?
Afterwards at the Chthonian it was like 
old times. Jack's birthday
was an occasion for champagne and the 
hot, dog-day evening was even more
volatile than usual. I felt highly 
confident, but here my plan went 
slightly
wrong. Emma was quite gay and 
responsive, but something about her 
hard,
handsome face warned me to lay off. I 
sensed that while she might willingly
surrender herself (in order to satisfy 
herself) she was far too sophisticated
and skilled in intrigue to compromise 
her position as Jack's mistress by
revealing anything important to me. So 
as I danced and sparred with Emma I
looked over the party for a second 
choice.
We were thrown together at the bar. Her 
name was Sybil and she
was one of those who assumed that my 
lectures on the woman question were
based upon a more intimate knowledge 
than the merely political and had
indicated several times a willingness 
to know me better. I had always
pretended not to understand, for not 
only had my first such experience taught
me to avoid such situations, but at the 
Chthonian she was usually slightly
tipsy and wistful -- just the type of 
misunderstood married woman whom,
even if I had been interested, I would 
have avoided like the plague. But now
her unhappiness and the fact that she 
was one of the big shot's wives made
her a perfect choice. She was very 
lonely and it went very smoothly. In the
noisy birthday party -- which was to be 
followed by a public celebration the
next evening -- we weren't noticed, and 
when she left fairly early in the
evening I saw her home. She felt 
neglected and he was always busy, and
when I left her I had arranged a 
rendezvous at my apartment for the
following evening. George, the husband, 
would be at the birthday celebration
and she wouldn't be missed.

IT WAS a hot dry August night. 
Lightning flashed across the eastern
sky and a breathless tension was in the 
humid air. I had spent the afternoon
preparing, leaving the office on a 
pretense of illness to avoid having to 
attend
the celebration. I had neither itch nor 
etchings, but there was a vase of
Chinese lilies in the living room, and 
another of American Beauty roses on
the table near the bed; and I had put 
in a supply of wine, whiskey and
liqueur, extra ice cubes, and 
assortments of fruit, cheese, nuts, 
candy and

other delicacies from the Vendome. In 
short, I tried to manage things as I
imagined Rinehart would have done.
But I bungled it from the beginning. I 
made the drinks too strong -which she 
liked too well; and I brought up 
politics -- which she all but hated
-- too early in the evening. For all 
her exposure to ideology she had no
interest in politics and no idea of the 
schemes that occupied her husband
night and day. She was more interested 
in the drinks, in which I had to join
her glass for glass, and in little 
dramas which she had dreamed up around
the figures of Joe Louis and Paul 
Robeson. And, although I had neither the
stature nor the temperament for either 
role, I was expected either to sing
"Old Man River" and just keep rolling 
along, or to do fancy tricks with my
muscles. I was confounded and amused 
and it became quite a contest, with
me trying to keep the two of us in 
touch with reality and with her casting
me

in

fantasies

in

which

I

was

Brother

Taboo-with-whom-all-things-are-possible.
Now it was late and as I came into the 
room with another round of
drinks she had let down her hair and 
was beckoning to me with a gold
hairpin in her teeth, saying, "Come to 
mamma, beautiful," from where she sat
on the bed.
"Your drink, madame," I said, handing 
her a glass and hoping the
fresh drink would discourage any new 
ideas.
"Come on, dear," she said coyly. "I 
want to ask you something."
"What is it?" I said.
"I have to whisper it, beautiful."
I sat and her lips came close to my 
ear. And suddenly she had
drained the starch out of me. I pulled 
away. There was something almost
prim about the way she sat there, and 
yet she had just made a modest
proposal that I join her in a very 
revolting ritual.
"What was that!" I said, and she 
repeated it. Had life suddenly
become a crazy Thurber cartoon?
"Please, you'll do that for me, won't 
you, beautiful?"
"You really mean it?"
"Yes," she said, "yes!"
There was a pristine incorruptibility 
about her face now that upset
me all the more, for she was neither 
kidding nor trying to insult me; and I

could not tell if it were horror 
speaking to me ont of innocence, or 
innocence
emerging unscathed from the obscene 
scheme of the evening. I only knew
that the whole affair was a mistake. 
She had no information and I decided to
get her out of the apartment before I 
had to deal definitely with either the
horror or the innocence, while I could 
still deal with it as a joke. What
would Rinehart do about this, I 
thought, and knowing, determined not to 
let
her provoke me to violence.
"But, Sybil, you can see I'm not like 
that. You make me feel a
tender, protective passion -- Look, 
it's like an oven in here, why don't we 
get
dressed and go for a walk in Central 
Park?"
"But I need it," she said, uncrossing 
her thighs and sitting up
eagerly. "You can do it, it'll be easy 
for you, beautiful. Threaten to kill me 
if
I don't give in. You know, talk rough 
to me, beautiful. A friend of mine said
the fellow said, 'Drop your drawers' . 
. . and --"
"He said what!" I said.
"He really did," she said.
I looked at her. She was blushing, her 
cheeks, even her freckled
bosom, were bright red.
"Go on," I said, as she lay back again. 
"Then what happened?"
"Well . . . he called her a filthy 
name," she said, hesitating coyly.
She was a leathery old girl with 
chestnut hair of fine natural wave 
which was
now fanned out over the pillow. She was 
blushing quite deeply. Was this
meant to excite me, or was it an 
unconscious expression of revulsion?
"A really filthy name," she said. "Oh, 
he was a brute, huge, with
white teeth, what they call a 'buck.' 
And he said, 'Bitch, drop your drawers,'
and then he did it. She's such a lovely 
girl, too, really delicate with a
complexion like strawberries and cream. 
You can't imagine anyone calling her
a name like that."
She sat up now, her elbows denting the 
pillow as she looked into my
face.
"But what happened, did they catch 
him?" I said.
"Oh, of course not, beautiful, she only 
told two of us girls. She
couldn't afford to let her husband hear 
of it. He . . . well, it's too long a
story."
"It's terrible," I said. "Don't you 
think we should go . . . ?"

"Isn't it, though? She was in a state 
for months . . ." her expression
flickered, became indeterminate.
"What is it?" I said, afraid she might 
cry.
"Oh, I was just wondering how she 
really felt. I really do." Suddenly
she looked at me mysteriously. "Can I 
trust you with a deep secret?"
I sat up. "Don't tell me that it was 
you."
She smiled, "Oh, no, that was a dear 
friend of mine. But do you
know what, beautiful," she said leaning 
forward confidentially, "I think I'm a
nymphomaniac."
"You? Noooo!"
"Uh huh. Sometimes I have such thoughts 
and dreams. I never give
into them though, but I really think I 
am. A woman like me has to develop
an iron discipline."
I laughed inwardly. She would soon be a 
biddy, stout, with a little
double chin and a three-ply girdle. A 
thin gold chain showed around a
thickening ankle. And yet I was 
becoming aware of something warmly,
infuriatingly feminine about her. I 
reached out, stroking her hand. "Why do
you have such ideas about yourself?" I 
said, seeing her raise up and pluck at
the corner of the pillow, drawing out a 
speckled feather and stripping the
down from its shaft.
"Repression," she said with great 
sophistication. "Men have repressed
us too much. We're expected to pass up 
too many human things. But do you
know another secret?"
I bowed my head.
"You don't mind my going on, do you, 
beautiful?"
"No, Sybil."
"Well, ever since I first heard about 
it, even when I was a very little
girl, I've wanted it to happen to me."
"You mean what happened to your friend?"
"Uh huh."
"Good Lord, Sybil, did you ever tell 
that to anyone else?"
"Of course not, I wouldn't've dared. 
Are you shocked?"
"Some. But Sybil, why do you tell me?"
"Oh, I know that I can trust you. I 
just knew you'd understand;
you're not like other men. We're kind 
of alike."

She was smiling now and reached out and 
pushed me gently, and I
thought, here it goes again.
"Lie back and let me look at you 
against that white sheet. You're
beautiful, I've always thought so. Like 
warm ebony against pure snow -- see
what you do, you make me talk poetry. 
'Warm ebony against pure snow,' isn't
that poetic?"
"I'm the sensitive type, you musn't 
make fun of me."
"But really you are, and I feel so free 
with you. You've no idea."
I looked at the red imprint left by the 
straps of her bra, thinking,
Who's taking revenge on whom? But why 
be surprised, when that's what they
hear all their lives. When it's made 
into a great power and they're taught to
worship all types of power? With all 
the warnings against it, some are bound
to want to try it out for themselves. 
The conquerors conquered. Maybe a
great number secretly want it; maybe 
that's why they scream when it's
farthest from possibility -"That's it," 
she said tightly. "Look at me like 
that; just like you want
to tear me apart. I love for you to 
look at me like that!"
I laughed and touched her chin. She had 
me on the ropes; I felt
punch drunk, I couldn't deliver and I 
couldn't be angry either. I thought of
lecturing her on the respect due one's 
bedmate in our society, but I no longer
deluded myself that I either knew the 
society or where I fitted into it.
Besides, I thought, she thinks you're 
an entertainer. That's something else
they're taught.
I raised my glass and she joined me in 
a drink, moving close.
"You will, won't you, beautiful?" she 
said, her lips, raw-looking now
without makeup, pouting babyishly. So 
why not entertain her, be a gentleman,
or whatever it is she thinks you are -- 
What does she think you are? A
domesticated rapist, obviously, an 
expert on the woman question. Maybe 
that's
what you are, house-broken and with a 
convenient verbal push-button
arrangement for the ladies' pleasure. 
Well, so I had set this trap for myself.
"Take this," I said, shoving another 
glass into her hand. "It'll be
better after you've had a drink, more 
realistic."
"Oh, yes, that'll be wonderful." She 
took a drink and looked up
thoughtfully. "I get so tired of living 
the way I do, beautiful. Soon I'll be 
old
and nothing will've happened to me. Do 
you know what that means? George

talks a lot about women's rights, but 
what does he know about what a
woman needs? Him with his forty minutes 
of brag and ten of bustle. Oh, you
have no idea what you're doing for me."
"Nor you for me, Sybil dear," I said, 
filling the glass again. At last
my drinks were beginning to work.
She shook her long hair out over her 
shoulders and crossed her
knees, watching me. Her head had begun 
to weave.
"Don't drink too much, beautiful," she 
said. "It always takes the pep
out of George."
"Don't worry," I said. "I rapes real 
good when I'm drunk."
She looked startled. "Ooooh, then pour 
me another," she said, giving
herself a bounce. She was as delighted 
as a child, holding out her glass
eagerly.
"What's happening here," I said, "a new 
birth of a nation?"
"What'd you say, beautiful?"
"Nothing, a bad joke. Forget it."
"That's what I like about you, 
beautiful. You haven't told me a single
one of those vulgar jokes. Come on, 
beautiful," she said, "pour."
I poured her another and another; in 
fact, I poured us both quite a
few. I was far away; it wasn't 
happening to me or to her and I felt a 
certain
confused pity which I didn't wish to 
feel. Then she looked at me, her eyes
bright behind narrowed lids and raised 
up and struck me where it hurt.
"Come on, beat me, daddy -- you -- you 
big black bruiser. What's
taking you so long?" she said. "Hurry 
up, knock me down! Don't you want
me?"
I was annoyed enough to slap her. She 
lay aggressively receptive,
flushed, her navel no goblet but a pit 
in an earth-quaking land, flexing taut
and expansive. Then she said, "Come on, 
come on!" and I said, "Sure, sure,"
looking around wildly and starting to 
pour the drink upon her and was
stopped, my emotions locked, as I saw 
her lipstick lying on the table and
grabbed it, saying, "Yes, yes," as I 
bent to write furiously across her 
belly in
drunken inspiration:
SYBIL, YOU WERE RAPED
BY

SANTA CLAUS
SURPRISE
and paused there, trembling above her, 
my knees on the bed as she waited
with unsteady expectancy. It was a 
purplish metallic shade of lipstick and 
as
she panted with anticipation the 
letters stretched and quivered, up hill 
and
down dale, and she was lit up like a 
luminescent sign.
"Hurry, boo'ful, hurry," she said.
I looked at her, thinking, Just wait 
until George sees that -- if
George ever gets around to seeing that. 
He'll read a lecture on an aspect of
the woman question he's never thought 
about. She lay anonymous beneath my
eyes until I saw her face, shaped by 
her emotion which I could not fulfill,
and I thought, Poor Sybil, she picked a 
boy for a man's job and nothing was
as it was supposed to be. Even the 
black bruiser fell down on the job. 
She'd
lost control of her liquor now and 
suddenly I bent and kissed her upon the
lips.
"Shhh, be quiet," I said, "that's no 
way to act when you're being --"
and she raised her lips for more and I 
kissed her again and calmed her and
she dozed off and I decided again to 
end the farce. Such games were for
Rinehart, not me. I stumbled out and 
got a damp towel and began rubbing
out the evidence of my crime. It was as 
tenacious as sin and it took some
time. Water wouldn't do it, whiskey 
would have smelled and finally I had to
find benzine. Fortunately she didn't 
arouse until I was almost finished.
"D'you do it, boo'ful?" she said.
"Yes, of course," I said. "Isn't that 
what you wanted?"
"Yes, but I don't seem t'remember . . ."
I looked at her and wanted to laugh. 
She was trying to see me but
her eyes wouldn't focus am aer head 
kept swinging to one side, yet she was
making a real effort, and suddenly I 
felt lighthearted.
"By the way," I said, trying to do 
something with her hair, "what's
your name, lady?"
"It's Sybil," she said indignantly, 
almost tearfully. "Boo'ful, you know
I'm Sybil."
"Not when I grabbed you, I didn't."
Her eyes widened and a smile wobbled 
across her face.

"That's right, you couldn't, could you? 
You never saw me before." She
was delighted, I could almost see the 
idea take form in her mind.
"That's

right,"

I

said.

"I

leaped

straight

out

of

the

wall.

I

overpowered you in the empty lobby -- 
remember? I smothered your terrified
screams."
" 'N' did I put up a good fight?"
"Like a lioness defending her young . . 
."
"But you were such a strong big brute 
you made me give in. I didn't
want to, did I now, boo'ful? You forced 
me 'gainst m' will."
"Sure," I said, picking up some silken 
piece of clothing. "You brought
out the beast in me. I overpowered you. 
But what could I do?"
She studied that a while and for a 
second her face worked again as
though she would cry. But it was 
another smile that bloomed there.
"And wasn't I a good nymphomaniac?" she 
said, watching me closely.
"Really and truly?"
"You have no idea," I said. "George had 
better keep an eye on you."
She twisted herself from side to side 
with irritation. "Oh, nuts! That
ole Georgie porgie wouldn't know a 
nymphomaniac if she got right into bed
with him!"
"You're wonderful," I said. "Tell me 
about George. Tell me about that
great master mind of social change."
She steadied her gaze, frowning. "Who, 
Georgie?" she said, looking at
me out of one bleary eye. "Georgie's 
blind 'sa mole in a hole 'n doesn't know
a thing about it. 'D you ever hear of 
such a thing, fifteen years! Say, 
what're
you laughing at, boo'ful?"
"Me," I said, beginning to roar, "just 
me . . ."
"I've never seen anyone laugh like you, 
boo'ful. It's wonderful!"
I was slipping her dress over her head 
now and her voice came
muffled through the shantung cloth. 
Then I had it down around her hips and
her flushed face wavered through the 
collar, her hair down in disorder again.
"Boo'ful,"

she

said,

blowing

the

word,

"will

you

do

sometimes?"
I stepped away and looked at her. 
"What?"
"Please, pretty boo'ful, please," she 
said with a wobbly smile.
I began to laugh, "Sure," I said, "sure 
. . ."

it

again

"When, boo'ful, when?"
"Any time," I said. "How about every 
Thursday at nine?"
"Oooooh, boo'ful," she said, giving me 
an old-fashioned hug. "I've
never seen anyone like you."
"Are you sure?" I said.
"Really, I haven't, boo'ful . . . Honor 
bright . . . believe me?"
"Sure, it's good to be seen, but we've 
got to go now," I said seeing
her about to sag to the bed.
She pouted. "I need a lil nightcap, 
boo'ful," she said.
"You've had enough," I said.
"Ah, boo'ful, jus' one . . ."
"Okay, just one."
We had another drink and I looked at 
her and felt the pity and
self-disgust returning and was 
depressed.
She looked at me gravely, her head to 
one side.
"Boo'ful," she said, "you know what lil 
ole Sybil thinks? She thinks
you're trying to get rid of her."
I looked at her out of a deep emptiness 
and refilled her glass and
mine. What had I done to her, allowed 
her to do? Had all of it filtered down
to me? My action . . . my -- the 
painful word formed as disconnectedly as
her wobbly smile -- my responsibility? 
All of it? I'm invisible. "Here," I 
said,
"drink."
"You too, boo'ful," she said.
"Yes," I said. She moved into my arms.

I MUST have dozed. There came the 
tinkling of ice in a glass, the
shrill of bells. I felt profoundly sad, 
as though winter had fallen during the
hour. She lay, her chestnut hair let 
down, watching through heavy-lidded,
blue, eye-shadowed eyes. From far away 
a new sound arose.
"Don't answer, boo'ful," she said, her 
voice coming through suddenly,
out of time with the working of her 
mouth.
"What?" I said.
"Don't answer, let'er ring," she said, 
reaching her red-nailed fingers
forth.

I took it from her hands, understanding 
now.
"Don't, boo'ful," she said.
It rang again in my hand now and for no 
reason at all the words of
a childhood prayer spilled through my 
mind like swift water. Then: "Hello," I
said.
It was a frantic, unrecognizable voice 
from the district. "Brother, you
better get up here right away --" it 
said.
"I'm ill," I said. "What's wrong?"
"There's trouble, Brother, and you're 
the only one who can --"
"What kind of trouble?"
"Bad trouble, Brother; they trying to 
--"
Then the harsh sound of breaking glass, 
distant, brittle and fine,
followed by a crash, and the line went 
dead.
"Hello," I said, seeing Sybil wavering 
before me, her lips saying,
"Boo'ful."
I tried to dial now, hearing the busy 
signal throbbing back at me:
Amen-Amen-Amen Ah man; and I sat there 
a while. Was it a trick? Did they
know she was with me? I put it down. 
Her eyes were looking at me from
out of their blue shadow. "Boo --"
And now I stood and pulled her arm. 
"Let's go, Sybil. They need me
uptown" -- realizing only then that I 
would go.
'"No," she said.
s'"But yes. Come."
She fell back upon the bed defying me. 
I released her arms and
looked around, my head unclear. What 
kind of trouble at this hour? Why
should I go? She watched me, her eyes 
brightly awash in blue shadow. My
heart felt low and deeply sad.
"Come back, boo'ful," she said.
"No, let's get some air," I said.
And now, avoiding the red, oily nails I 
gripped her wrists and pulled
her up, toward the door. We tottered, 
her lips brushing mine as we wavered
there. She clung to me and, for an 
instant, I to her with a feeling
immeasurably sad. Then she hiccupped 
and I looked vacantly back into the
room. The light caught in the amber 
liquid of our glasses.
"Boo'ful," she said, "life could be so 
diff'rent --"

"But it never is," I said.
She said, "Boo'ful."
The fan whirred. And in a corner, my 
brief case, covered with specks
of dust like memories -- the night of 
the battle royal. I felt her breathing 
hot
against me and pushed her gently away, 
steadying her against the door frame,
then went over as impulsively as the 
remembered prayer, and got the brief
case, brushing the dust against my leg 
and feeling the unexpected weight as I
hugged it beneath my arm. Something 
clinked inside.
She watched me still, her eyes alight 
as I took her arm.
"How're you doing, Syb?" I said.
"Don't go, boo'ful," she said. "Let 
Georgie do it. No speeches tonight."
"Come on," I said, taking her arm quite 
firmly, pulling her along as
she sighed, her wistful face turned 
toward me.
We went down smoothly into the street. 
My head was still badly
fuzzed from the drink, and when I 
looked down the huge emptiness of the
dark I felt like tears . . . What was 
happening uptown? Why should I worry
over bureaucrats, blind men? I am 
invisible. I stared down the quiet 
street,
feeling her stumbling beside me, 
humming a little tune; something fresh, 
na?e
and carefree. Sybil, my 
too-late-too-early love . . . Ah! My 
throat throbbed.
The heat of the street clung close. I 
looked for a taxi but none was passing.
She hummed beside me, her perfume 
unreal in the night. We moved into the
next block and still no taxis. Her high 
heels unsteadily scrunched the walk. I
stopped her.
"Poor boo'ful," she said. "Don't know 
his name . . ."
I turned as though struck. "What?"
"Anonymous brute 'n boo'ful buck," she 
said, her mouth a bleary
smile.
I looked at her, skittering about on 
high heels, scrunch, scrunch on
the walk.
"Sybil," I said, more to myself than to 
her, "where will it end?"
Something told me to go.
"Aaaah," she laughed, "in bed. Don't go 
up, boo'ful, Sybil'll tuck you
in."
I shook my head. The stars were there, 
high, high, revolving. Then I
closed my eyes and they sailed red 
behind my lids; then somewhat steadied I

took her arm.
"Look, Sybil," I said, "stand here a 
minute while I go over to Fifth
for a taxi. Stand right here, dear, and 
hold on."
We tottered before an ancient-looking 
building, its windows dark.
Huge Greek medallions showed in spots 
of light upon its fa?de, above a dark
labyrinthine pattern in the stone, and 
I propped her against the stoop with
its carved stone monster. She leaned 
there, her hair wild, looking at me in
the street light, smiling. Her face 
kept swinging to one side, her right eye
desperately closed.
"Sure, boo'ful, sure," she said.
"I'll be right back," I said, backing 
away.
"Boo'ful," she called, "My boo'ful."
Hear the true affection, I thought, the 
adoration of the Boogie Bear,
moving away. Was she calling me 
beautiful or boogieful, beautiful or 
sublime
. . . What'd either mean? I am 
invisible . . .
I went on through the late street 
quiet, hoping that a cab would pass
before I had gone all the way. Up ahead 
at Fifth the lights were bright, a
few cars shooting across the gaping 
mouth of the street and above and
beyond, the trees -- great, dark, tall. 
What was going on, I pondered. Why
call for me so late -- and who?
I hurried ahead, my feet unsteady.
"Booo'ful," she called behind me, 
"boooooo'ful!"
I waved without looking back. Never 
again, no more, no more. I
went on.
At Fifth a cab passed and I tried to 
hail it, only to hear someone's
voice arise, the sound floating gaily 
by. I looked up the lighted avenue for
another, hearing suddenly the screech 
of brakes and turning to see the cab
stop and a white arm beckoning. The cab 
reversed, rolled close, settling with
a bounce. I laughed. It was Sybil. I 
stumbled forward, came to the door. She
smiled out at me, her head, framed in 
the window, still pulling to one side,
her hair waving down.
"Get in, boo'ful, 'n take me to Harlem 
. . ."
I shook my head, feeling it heavy and 
sad. "No," I said, "I've got
work to do, Sybil. You'd better go home 
. . ."
"No, boo'ful, take me with you."

I turned to the driver, my hand upon 
the door. He was small,
dark-haired and disapproving, a glint 
of red from the traffic light coloring 
the
tip of his nose.
"Look," I said, "take her home."
I gave him the address and my last 
five-dollar bill. He took it,
glumly disapproving.
"No, boo'ful," she said, "I want to go 
to Harlem, be with you!"
"Good night," I said, stepping back 
from the curb.
We were in the middle of the block and 
I saw them pull away.
"No," she said, "no, boo'ful. Don't 
leave . . ." Her face, wild-eyed and
white, showed in the door. I stood 
there, watching him plunge swiftly and
contemptuously out of sight, his tail 
light as red as his nose.
I walked with eyes closed, seeming to 
float and trying to clear my
head, then opened them and crossed to 
the park side, along the cobbles.
High above, the cars sailed round and 
round the drive, their headlights
stabbing. All the taxies were hired, 
all going downtown. Center of gravity. I
plodded on, my head awhirl.
Then near 110th Street I saw her again. 
She was waiting beneath a
street lamp, waving. I wasn't 
surprised; I had become fatalistic. I 
came up
slowly, hearing her laugh. She was 
ahead of me and beginning to run,
barefoot, loosely, as in a dream. 
Running. Unsteadily but swift and me
surprised and unable to catch up, 
lead-legged, seeing her ahead and 
calling,
"Sybil, Sybil!" running lead-legged 
along the park side.
"Come on, boo'ful," she called, looking 
back and stumbling. "Catch
Sybil . . . Sybil," running barefoot 
and girdleless along the park.
I ran, the brief case heavy beneath my 
arm. Something told me I
had to get to the office . . . "Sybil, 
wait!" I called.
She ran, the colors of her dress 
flaring flamelike in the bright places
of the dark. A rustling motion, legs 
working awkwardly beneath her and white
heels flashing, her skirts held high. 
Let her go, I thought. But now she was
crossing the street and running wildly 
only to go down at the curb and
standing and going down again, with a 
bumped backside, completely unsteady,
now that her momentum was gone.
"Boo'ful," she said as I came up. 
"Damn, boo'ful, you push me?"
"Get up," I said without anger. "Get 
up," taking her soft arm. She

stood, her arms flung wide for an 
embrace.
"No," I said, "this isn't Thursday. 
I've got to get there . . . What do
they plan for me, Sybil?"
"Who, boo'ful?"
"Jack and George . . . Tobitt and all?"
"You ran me down, boo'ful," she said. 
"Forget them . . . bunch of
dead-heads . . . unhipped, y'know. We 
didn't make this stinking world,
boo'ful. Forget --"
I saw the taxi just in time, 
approaching swiftly from the corner, a
double-decker bus looming two blocks 
behind. The cabbie looked over, his
head out of the window, sitting high at 
the wheel as he made a swift U-turn
and came alongside. His face was 
shocked, disbelieving.
"Come now, Sybil," I said, "and no 
tricks."
"Pardon me, old man," the driver said, 
his voice concerned, "but
you're not taking her up in Harlem are 
you?"
"No, the lady's going downtown," I 
said. "Get in Sybil."
"Boo'ful's 'n ole dictator," she said 
to the driver, who looked at me
silently, as though I were mad.
"A game stud," he muttered, "a most 
game stud!"
But she got in.
"Just 'n ole dictator, boo'ful."
"Look," I told him, "take her straight 
home and don't let her get out
of the cab. I don't want her running 
around Harlem. She's precious, a great
lady --"
"Sure, man, I don't blame you," he 
said. "Things is popping up
there."
The cab was already rolling as I 
yelled, "What's going on?"
"They're taking the joint apart," he 
called above the shifting of the
gears. I watched them go and made for 
the bus stop. This time I'll make
sure, I thought, stepping out and 
flagging the bus and getting on. If she
comes back, she'll find me gone. And I 
knew stronger than ever that I should
hurry but was still too foggy in my 
mind, couldn't get myself together.
I sat gripping my brief case, my eyes 
closed, feeling the bus sailing
swift beneath me. Soon it would turn up 
Seventh Avenue. Sybil, forgive me, I
thought. The bus rolled.

But when I opened my eyes we were 
turning into Riverside Drive.
This too I accepted calmly, the whole 
night was out of joint. I'd had too
many drinks. Time ran fluid, invisible, 
sad. Looking out I could see a ship
moving upstream, its running lights 
bright points in the night. The cool sea
smell came through to me, constant and 
thick in the swiftly unfolding blur of
anchored boats, dark water and lights 
pouring past. Across the river was
Jersey and I remembered my entry into 
Harlem. Long past, I thought, long
past. I was as if drowned in the river.
To my right and ahead the church spire 
towered high, crowned with
a red light of warning. And now we were 
passing the hero's tomb and I
recalled a visit there. You went up the 
steps and inside and you looked far
below to find him, at rest, draped 
flags . . .
One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street 
came quickly. I stumbled off,
hearing the bus pull away as I faced 
the water. There was a light breeze, but
now with the motion gone the heat 
returned, clinging. Far ahead in the 
dark
I saw the monumental bridge, ropes of 
lights across the dark river; and
closer, high above the shoreline, the 
Palisades, their revolutionary agony 
lost
in the riotous lights of roller 
coasters. "The Time Is Now . . ." the 
sign
across the river began, but with 
history stomping upon me with hobnailed
boots, I thought with a laugh, why 
worry about time? I crossed the street 
to
the drinking fountain, feeling the 
water cooling, going down, then 
dampened a
handkerchief and swabbed my face, eyes. 
The water flashed, gurgled, sprayed.
I pressed forward my face, feeling wet 
cool, hearing the infant joy of
fountains. Then heard the other sound. 
It was not the river nor the curving
cars that flashed through the dark, but 
pitched like a distant crowd or a swift
river at floodtide.
I moved forward, found the steps and 
started down. Below the bridge
lay the hard stone river of the street, 
and for a second I looked at the waves
of cobblestones as though I expected 
water, as though the fountain above had
drawn from them. Still I would enter 
and go across to Harlem. Below the
steps the trolley rails gleamed steely. 
I hurried, the sound drawing closer,
myriad-voiced, humming, enfolding me, 
numbing the air, as I started beneath
the ramp. It came, a twitter, a coo, a 
subdued roar that seemed trying to tell
me something, give me some message. I 
stopped, looking around me; the
girders marched off rhythmically into 
the dark, over the cobblestones the red

lights shone. Then I was beneath the 
bridge and it was as though they had
been waiting for me and no one but me 
-- dedicated and set aside for me -for 
an eternity. And I looked above toward 
the sound, my mind forming an
image of wings, as something struck my 
face and streaked, and I could smell
the foul air now, and see the encrusted 
barrage, feeling it streak my jacket
and raising my brief case above my head 
and running, hearing it splattering
around, falling like rain. I ran the 
gantlet, thinking, even the birds; even 
the
pigeons and the sparrows and the goddam 
gulls! I ran blindly, boiling with
outrage and despair and harsh laughter. 
Running from the birds to what, I
didn't know. I ran. Why was I here at 
all?
I ran through the night, ran within 
myself. Ran.

Chapter 25
When I reached Morningside the shooting 
sounded like a distant
celebration of the Fourth of July, and 
I hurried forward. At St. Nicholas the
street lights were out. A thunderous 
sound arose and I saw four men running
toward me pushing something that jarred 
the walk. It was a safe.
"Say," I began.
"Get the hell out the way!"
I leaped aside, into the street, and 
there was a sudden and brilliant
suspension of time, like the interval 
between the last ax stroke and the 
felling
of a tall tree, in which there had been 
a loud noise followed by a loud
silence. Then I was aware of figures 
crouching in doorways and along the
curb; then time burst and I was down in 
the street, conscious but unable to
rise, struggling against the street and 
seeing the flashes as the guns went off
back at the corner of the avenue, aware 
to my left of the men still speeding
the rumbling safe along the walk as 
back up the street, behind me, two
policemen, almost invisible in black 
shirts, thrust flaming pistols before 
them.
One of the safe rollers pitched 
forward, and farther away, past the 
corner, a
bullet struck an auto tire, the 
released air shrieking like a huge 
animal in

agony. I rolled, flopping around, 
willing myself to crawl closer to the 
curb but
unable, feeling a sudden wet warmth 
upon my face and seeing the safe
shooting wildly into the intersection 
and the men rounding the corner into
the dark, pounding, gone; gone now, as 
the skittering safe bounded off at a
tangent, shot into the intersection and 
lodged in the third rail and sent up a
curtain of sparks that lit up the block 
like a blue dream; a dream I was
dreaming and through which I could see 
the cops braced as on a target
range, feet forward, free arms akimbo, 
firing with deliberate aim.
"Get hold of Emergency!" one of them 
called, and I saw them turn
and disappear where the dull glint of 
trolley rails faded off into the dark.
Suddenly the block leaped alive. Men 
who seemed to rise up out of
the sidewalks were rushing into the 
store fronts above me, their voices 
rising
excitedly. And now the blood was in my 
face and I could move, getting to
my knees as someone out of the crowd 
was helping me to stand.
"You hurt, daddy?"
"Some -- I don't know --" I couldn't 
quite see them.
"Damn! He's got a hole in his head!" a 
voice said.
A light flashed in my face, came close. 
I felt a hard hand upon my
skull and moved away.
"Hell, it's just a nick," a voice said. 
"One them forty-fives hit your
little finger you got to go down!"
"Well, this one over here is gone down 
for the last time," someone
called from the walk. "They got him 
clean."
I wiped my face, my head ringing. 
Something was missing.
"Here, buddy, this yours?"
It was my brief case, extended to me by 
its handles. I seized it with
sudden panic, as though something 
infinitely precious had almost been 
lost to
me.
"Thanks," I said, peering into their 
dim, blue-tinted features. I looked
at the dead man. He lay face forward, 
the crowd working around him. I
realized suddenly that it might have 
been me huddled there, feeling too that 
I
had seen him there before, in the 
bright light of noon, long ago . . . how
long? Knew his name, I thought, and 
suddenly my knees flowed forward. I
sat there, my fist that gripped the 
brief case bruising against the street, 
my
head slumped forward. They were going 
around me.

"Get off my foot, man," I heard. "Quit 
shoving. There's plenty for
everybody."
There was something I had to do and I 
knew that my forgetfulness
wasn't real, as one knows that the 
forgotten details of certain dreams are 
not
truly forgotten but evaded. I knew, and 
in my mind I was trying to reach
through the gray veil that now seemed 
to hang behind my eyes as opaquely
as the blue curtain that screened the 
street beyond the safe. The dizziness 
left
and I managed to stand, holding onto my 
brief case, pressing a handkerchief
to my head. Up the street there sounded 
the crashing of huge sheets of glass
and through the blue mysteriousness of 
the dark the walks shimmered like
shattered mirrors. All the street's 
signs were dead, all the day sounds had 
lost
their stable meaning. Somewhere a 
burglar alarm went off, a meaningless
blangy sound, followed by the joyful 
shouts of looters.
"Come on," someone called nearby.
"Let's go, buddy," the man who had 
helped me said. He took my
arm, a thin man who carried a large 
cloth bag slung over his shoulder.
"The shape you in wouldn't do to leave 
you round here," he said.
"You act like you drunk."
"Go where?" I said.
"Where? Hell, man. Everywhere. We git 
to moving, no telling where
we might go -- Hey, Dupre!" he called.
"Say, man -- Goddam! Don't be calling 
my name so loud," a voice
answered. "Here, I am over here, 
gitting me some work shirts."
"Git some for me, Du," he said.
"All right, but don't think I'm your 
papa," the answer came.
I looked at the thin man, feeling a 
surge of friendship. He didn't
know me, his help was disinterested . . 
.
"Hey, Du," he called, "we go'n do it?"
"Hell yes, soon as I git me these 
shirts."
The crowd was working in and out of the 
stores like ants around
spilled sugar. From time to time there 
came the crash of glass, shots; fire
trucks in distant streets.
"How you feel?" the man said.
"Still fuzzy," I said, "and weak."
"Le's see if it's stopped bleeding. 
Yeah, you'll be all right."

I saw him vaguely though his voice came 
clear.
"Sure," I said.
"Man, you lucky you ain't dead. These 
sonsabitches is really shooting
now," he said. "Over on Lenox they was 
aiming up in the air. If I could find
me a rifle, I'd show 'em! Here, take 
you a drink of this good Scotch," he
said, taking a quart bottle from a hip 
pocket. "I got me a whole case stashed
what I got from a liquor store over 
there. Over there all you got to do is
breathe, and you drunk, man. Drunk! 
Hundred proof bonded whiskey flowing
all in the gutters."
I took a drink, shuddering as the 
whiskey went down but thankful
for the shock it gave me. There was a 
bursting, tearing movement of people
around me, dark figures in a blue glow.
"Look at them take it away," he said, 
looking into the dark action of
the crowd. "Me, I'm tired. Was you over 
on Lenox?"
"No," I said, seeing a woman moving 
slowly past with a row of about
a dozen dressed chickens suspended by 
their necks from the handle of a new
straw broom . . .
"Hell, you ought to see it, man. 
Everything is tore up. By now the
womens is picking it clean. I saw one 
ole woman with a whole side of a cow
on her back. Man, she was 'bout bent 
bowlegged trying to make it home -Here 
come Dupre now," he said, breaking off.
I saw a little hard man come out of the 
crowd carrying several
boxes. He wore three hats upon his 
head, and several pairs of suspenders
flopped about his shoulders, and now as 
he came toward us I saw that he
wore a pair of gleaming new rubber hip 
boots. His pockets bulged and over
his shoulder he carried a cloth sack 
that swung heavily behind him.
"Damn, Dupre," my friend said, pointing 
to his head, "you got one of
them for me? What kind is they?"
Dupre stopped and looked at him. "With 
all them hats in there and
I'm going to come out with anything but 
a Dobbs? Man, are you mad? All
them new, pretty-colored Dobbs? Come 
on, let's get going before the cops git
back. Damn, look at that thing blaze!"
I looked toward the curtain of blue 
fire, through which vague figures
toiled. Dupre called out and several 
men left the crowd and joined us in the
street. We moved off, my friend 
(Scofield, the others called him) 
leading me

along. My head throbbed, still bled.
"Looks like you got you some loot too," 
he said, pointing to my brief
case.
"Not much," I said, thinking, loot? 
Loot? And suddenly I knew why
it was heavy, remembering Mary's broken 
bank and the coins; and now I
found myself opening the brief case and 
dropping all my papers -- my
Brotherhood identification, the 
anonymous letter, along with Clifton's 
doll -into it.
"Fill it up, man. Don't you be bashful. 
You wait till we tackle one of
these pawnshops. That Du's got him a 
cotton-picking sack fulla stuff. He
could go into business."
"Well, I'll be damn," a man on the 
other side of me said. "I thought
that was a cotton sack. Where'd he get 
that thing?"
"He brought it with him when he come 
North," Scofield said. "Du
swears that when he goes back he'll 
have it full of ten-dollar bills. Hell, 
after
tonight he'll need him a warehouse for 
all the stuff he's got. You fill that
brief case, buddy. Get yourself 
something!"
"No," I said, "I've enough in it 
already." And now I remembered very
clearly where I'd started out for but 
could not leave them.
"Maybe you right," Scofield said. "How 
I know, you might have it full
of diamonds or something. A man 
oughtn't to be greedy. Though it's time
something like this happened."
We moved along. Should I leave, get on 
to the district? Where were
they, at the birthday celebration?
"How did all this get started?" I said.
Scofield seemed surprised. "Damn if I 
know, man. A cop shot a
woman or something."
Another man moved close to us as 
somewhere a piece of heavy steel
rang down.
"Hell, that wasn't what started it," he 
said. "It was that fellow, what's
his name . . . ?"
"Who?" I said. "What's his name?"
"That young guy!"
"You know, everybody's mad about it . . 
."
Clifton, I thought. It's for Clifton. A 
night for Clifton.

"Aw man, don't tell me," Scofield said. 
"Didn't I see it with my own
eyes? About eight o'clock down on Lenox 
and 123rd this paddy slapped a kid
for grabbing a Baby Ruth and the kid's 
mama took it up and then the paddy
slapped her and that's when hell broke 
loose."
"You were there?" I said.
"Same's I'm here. Some fellow said the 
kid made the paddy mad by
grabbing a candy named after a white 
woman."
"Damn if that's the way I heard it," 
another man said. "When I come
up they said a white woman set it oft 
by trying to take a black gal's man."
"Damn who started it," Dupre said. "All 
I want is for it to last a
while."
"It was a white gal, all right, but 
that wasn't the way it was. She was
drunk --" another voice said.
But it couldn't have been Sybil, I 
thought; it had already started.
"You wahn know who started it?" a man 
holding a pair of binoculars
called from the window of a pawnshop. 
"You wahn really to know?"
"Sure," I said.
"Well, you don't need to go no further. 
It was started by that great
leader, Ras the Destroyer!"
"That monkey-chaser?" someone said.
"Listen, bahstard!"
"Don't nobody know how it started," 
Dupre said.
"Somebody has to know," I said.
Scofield held his whiskey toward me. I 
refused it.
"Hell, man, it just exploded. These is 
dog days," he said.
"Dog days?"
"Sho, this hot weather."
"I tell you they mad over what happen 
to that young fellow,
what's-his-name . . ."
We were passing a building now and I 
heard a voice calling
frantically, "Colored store! Colored 
store!"
"Then put up a sign, motherfouler," a 
voice said. "You probably
rotten as the others."
"Listen at the bastard. For one time in 
his life he's glad to be
colored," Scofield said.

"Colored store," the voice went on 
automatically.
"Hey! You sho you ain't got some white 
blood?"
"No, sir!" the voice said.
"Should I bust him, man?"
"For what? He ain't got a damn thing. 
Let the motherfouler alone."
A few doors away we came to a hardware 
store. "This is the first
stop, men," Dupre said.
"What happens now?" I said.
"Who you?" he said, cocking his 
thrice-hatted head.
"Nobody, just one of the boys --" I 
began.
"You sho you ain't somebody I know?"
"I'm pretty sure," I said.
"He's all right, Du," said Scofield. 
"Them cops shot him."
Dupre looked at me and kicked something 
-- a pound of butter,
sending it smearing across the hot 
street. "We fixing to do something what
needs to be done," he said. "First we 
gets a flashlight for everybody . . . 
And
let's have some organization, y'all. 
Don't everybody be running over 
everybody
else. Come on!"
"Come on in, buddy," Scofield said.
I felt no need to lead or leave them; 
was glad to follow; was gripped
by a need to see where and to what they 
would lead. And all the time the
thought that I should go to the 
district was with me. We went inside the
store, into the dark glinting with 
metal. They moved carefully, and I could
hear them searching, sweeping objects 
to the floor. The cash register rang.
"Here some flashlights over here," 
someone called.
"How many?" Dupre said.
"Plenty, man."
"Okay, pass out one to everybody. They 
got batteries?"
"Naw, but there's plenty them too, 
'bout a dozen boxes."
"Okay, give me one with batteries so I 
can find the buckets. Then
every man get him a light."
"Here some buckets over here," Scofield 
said.
"Then all we got to find is where he 
keeps the oil."
"Oil?" I said.
"Coal oil, man. And hey, y'all," he 
called, '"don't nobody be smoking

in here."
I stood beside Scofield listening to 
the noise as he took a stack of
zinc buckets and passed them out. Now 
the store leaped alive with flashing
lights and flickering shadows.
"Keep them lights down on the floor," 
Dupre called. "No use letting
folks see who we are. Now when you get 
your buckets line up and let me fill
'em."
"Listen to ole Du lay it down -- he's a 
bitch, ain't he, buddy? He
always liked to lead things. And always 
leading me into trouble."
"What are we getting ready to do?" I 
said.
"You'll see," Dupre said. "Hey, you 
over there. Come on from behind
that counter and take this bucket. 
Don't you see ain't nothing in that cash
register, that if it was I'd have it 
myself?"
Suddenly the banging of buckets ceased. 
We moved into the back
room. By the light of a flash I could 
see a row of fuel drums mounted on
racks. Dupre stood before them in his 
new hip boots and filled each bucket
with oil. We moved in slow order. Our 
buckets filled, we filed out into the
street. I stood there in the dark 
feeling a rising excitement as their 
voices
played around me. What was the meaning 
of it all? What should I think of
it, do about it?
"With this stuff," Dupre said, "we 
better walk in the middle of the
street. It's just down around the 
corner."
Then as we moved off a group of boys 
ran among us and the men
started using their lights, revealing 
darting figures in blonde wigs, the 
tails of
their stolen dress coats flying. Behind 
them in hot pursuit came a gang
armed with dummy rifles taken from an 
Army & Navy Store. I laughed with
the others, thinking: A holy holiday 
for Clifton.
"Put out them lights!" Dupre commanded.
Behind us came the sound of screams, 
laughter; ahead the footfalls of
the running boys, distant fire trucks, 
shooting, and in the quiet intervals, 
the
steady filtering of shattered glass. I 
could smell the kerosene as it sloshed
from the buckets and slapped against 
the street.
Suddenly Scofield grabbed my arm. "Good 
God, look-a-yonder!"
And I saw a crowd of men running up 
pulling a Borden's milk
wagon, on top of which, surrounded by a 
row of railroad flares, a huge

woman in a gingham pinafore sat 
drinking beer from a barrel which sat
before her. The men would run furiously 
a few paces and stop, resting
between the shafts, run a few paces and 
rest, shouting and laughing and
drinking from a jug, as she on top 
threw back her head and shouted
passionately in a full-throated voice 
of blues singer's timbre:
If it hadn't been for the referee,
Joe Louis woulda killed
Jim Jefferie
Free beer!!
-- sloshing the dipper of beer around.
We stepped aside, amazed, as she bowed 
graciously from side to side
like a tipsy fat lady in a circus 
parade, the dipper like a gravy spoon 
in her
enormous hand. Then she laughed and 
drank deeply while reaching over
nonchalantly with her free hand to send 
quart after quart ot milk crashing
into the street. And all the time the 
men running with the wagon over the
debris. Around me there were shouts of 
laughter and disapproval.
"Somebody better stop them fools," 
Scofield said in outrage. "That's
what I call taking things too far. 
Goddam, how the hell they going to get 
her
down from there after she gits fulla 
beer? Somebody answer me that. How
they going to get her down? 'Round here 
throwing away all that good milk!"
The big woman left me unnerved. Milk 
and beer -- I felt sad,
watching the wagon careen dangerously 
as they went around a corner. We
went on, avoiding the broken bottles as 
now the spilling kerosene splashed
into the pale spilt milk. How much has 
happened? Why was I torn? We
moved around a corner. My head still 
ached.
Scofield touched my arm. "Here we is," 
he said.
We had come to a huge tenement building.
"Where are we?" I said.
"This the place where most of us live," 
he said. "Come on."
So that was it, the meaning of the 
kerosene. I couldn't believe it,
couldn't believe they had the nerve. 
All the windows seemed empty. They'd
blacked it out themselves. I saw now 
only by flash or flame.
"Where will you live?" I said, looking 
up, up.

"You call this living?" Scofield said. 
"It's the only way to git rid of it,
man . . ."
I looked for hesitation in their vague 
forms. They stood looking at
the building rising above us, the 
liquid dark of the oil simmering dully 
in the
stray flecks of light that struck their 
pails, bent forward, their shoulders
bowed. None said "no," by word or 
stance. And in the dark windows and on
the roofs above I could now discern the 
forms of women and children.
Dupre moved toward the building.
"Now look ahere, y'all," he said, his 
triple-hatted head showing
grotesquely atop the stoop. "I wants 
all the women and chillun and the old
and the sick folks brought out. And 
when you takes your buckets up the
stairs I wants you to go clean to the 
top. I mean the top! And when you git
there I want you to start using your 
flashlights in every room to make sure
nobody gits left behind, then when you 
git 'em out start splashing coal oil.
Then when you git it splashed I'm going 
to holler, and when I holler three
times I want you to light them matches 
and git. After that it's every tub on
its own black bottom!"
It didn't occur to me to interfere, or 
to question . . . They had a
plan. Already I could see the women and 
children coming down the steps. A
child was crying. And suddenly everyone 
paused, turning, looking off into the
dark. Somewhere nearby an incongruous 
sound shook the dark, an air
hammer pounding like a machine gun. 
They paused with the sensitivity of
grazing deer, then returned to their 
work, the women and children once more
moving.
"That's right, y'all. You ladies move 
on up the street to the folks you
going to stay with," Dupre said. "And 
keep holt them kids!"
Someone pounded my back and I swung 
around, seeing a woman
push past me and climb up to catch 
Dupre's arm, their two figures seeming
to blend as her voice arose, thin, 
vibrant and desperate.
"Please, Dupre," she said, "please. You 
know my time's almost here .
. . you know it is. If you do it now, 
where am I going to go?"
Dupre pulled away and rose to a higher 
step. He looked down at
her, shaking his thrice-hatted head. 
"Now git on out the way, Lottie," he 
said
patiently. "Why you have to start this 
now? We done been all over it and
you know I ain't go'n change. And 
lissen here, the resta y'all," he said,

reaching into the top of his hip boot 
and producing a nickel-plated revolver
and waving it around, "don't think 
they's going to be any mind-changing
either. And I don't aim for no 
arguments neither."
"You goddam right, Dupre. We wid you!"
"My kid died from the t-bees in that 
deathtrap, but I bet a man ain't
no more go'n be born in there," he 
said. "So now, Lottie, you go on up the
street and let us mens git going."
She stood back, crying. I looked at 
her, in house shoes, her breasts
turgid, her belly heavy and high. In 
the crowd, women's hands took her away,
her large liquid eyes turned for a 
second toward the man in the rubber
boots.
What type of man is he, what would Jack 
say of him? Jack. Jack!
And where was he in this?
"Let's go, buddy," Scofield said, 
nudging me. I followed him, filled
with a sense of Jack's outrageous 
unreality. We went in, up the stairs,
flashing our lights. Ahead I saw Dupre 
moving. He was a type of man
nothing in my life had taught me to 
see, to understand, or respect, a man
outside the scheme till now. We entered 
rooms littered with the signs of swift
emptying. It was hot, close.
"This here's my own apartment," 
Scofield said. "And ain't the bedbugs
going to get a surprise!"
We slopped the kerosene about, upon an 
old mattress, along the
floor; then moved into the hall, using 
the flashlights. From all through the
building came the sounds of footsteps, 
of splashing oil, the occasional
prayerful protest of some old one being 
forced to leave. The men worked in
silence now, like moles deep in the 
earth. Time seemed to hold. No one
laughed. Then from below came Dupre's' 
voice.
"Okay, mens. We got everybody out. Now 
starting with the top floor
I want you to start striking matches. 
Be careful and don't set yourself on 
fire
. . ."
There was still some kerosene left in 
Scofield's bucket and I saw him
pick up a rag and drop it in; then came 
the sputtering of a match and I saw
the room leap to flame. The heat flared 
up and I backed away. He stood
there silhouetted against the red 
flare, looking into the flames, 
shouting.
"Goddam you rotten sonsabitches. You 
didn't think I'd do it but there

it is. You wouldn't fix it up. Now see 
how you like it."
"Let's go," I said.
Below us, men shot downstairs five and 
six steps at a time, moving
in the weird light of flash and flame 
in long, dream-bounds. On each floor as
I passed, smoke and flame arose. And 
now I was seized with a fierce sense
of exaltation. They've done it, I 
thought. They organized it and carried 
it
through alone; the decision their own 
and their own action. Capable of their
own action . . .
There came a thunder of footfalls above 
me, someone calling, "Keep
going man, it's hell upstairs. Somebody 
done opened the door to the roof and
them flames is leaping."
"Come on," Scofield said.
I moved, feeling something slip and was 
halfway down the next flight
before realizing that my brief case was 
gone. For a second I hesitated, but I'd
had it too long to leave it now.
"Come on, buddy," Scofield called, "we 
caint be fooling around."
"In a second," I said.
Men were shooting past. I bent over, 
holding on to the handrail and
shouldered my way back up the stairs, 
using my flash along each step, back
slowly, finding it, an oily footstep 
embedded with crushed pieces of plaster
showing upon its leather side; getting 
it now and turning to bound down
again. The oil won't come off easily, I 
thought with a pang. But this was it,
what I had known was coming around the 
dark corner of my mind, had
known and tried to tell the committee 
and which they had ignored. I plunged
down, shaking with fierce excitement.
At the landing I saw a bucket half full 
of kerosene and seized it,
flinging it impulsively into a burning 
room. A huge puff of smoke-fringed
flame filled the doorway, licking 
outward toward me. I ran, choking and
coughing as I plunged. They did it 
themselves, I thought, holding my breath
-- planned it, organized it, applied 
the flame.
I burst into the air and the exploding 
sounds of the night, and I did
not know if the voice was that of a 
man, woman or child, but for a moment
I stood on the stoop with the red 
doorway behind me and heard the voice
call me by my Brotherhood name.
It was as though I had been aroused 
from sleep and for an instant I

stood there looking, listening to the 
voice almost lost in the clamour of
shouts, screams, burglar alarms and 
sirens.
"Brother, ain't it wonderful," it 
called. "You said you would lead us,
you really said it . . ."
I went down into the street, going 
slowly but filled with a feverish
inner need to be away from that voice. 
Where had Scofield gone?
Most of their eyes, white in the 
flame-flushed dark, looked toward
the building.
But now I heard someone say, "Woman, 
who you say that is?" And
she proudly repeated my name.
"Where he go? Get him, mahn, Ras wahnt 
him!"
I went into the crowd, walking slowly, 
smoothly into the dark crowd,
the whole surface of my skin alert, my 
back chilled, looking, listening to
those moving with a heaving and 
sweating and a burr of talk around me 
and
aware that now that I wanted to see 
them, needed to see them, I could not;
feeling them, a dark mass in motion on 
a dark night, a black river ripping
through a black land; and Ras or Tarp 
could move beside me and I wouldn't
know. I was one with the mass, moving 
down the littered street over the
puddles of oil and milk, my personality 
blasted. Then I was in the next block,
dodging in and out, hearing them 
somewhere in the crowd behind me;
moving on through the sound of sirens 
and burglar alarms to be swept into a
swifter crowd and pushed along, 
half-running, half-walking, trying to 
see
behind me and wondering where the 
others had gone. There was shooting
back there now, and on either side of 
me they were throwing garbage cans,
bricks and pieces of metal into plate 
glass windows. I moved, feeling as
though a huge force was on the point of 
bursting. Shouldering my way to the
side I stood in a doorway and watched 
them move, feeling a certain
vindication as now I thought of the 
message that had brought me here. Who
had called, one of the district members 
or someone from Jack's birthday
celebration? Who wanted me at the 
district after it was too late? Very 
well,
I'd go there now. I'd see what the 
master minds thought now. Where were
they anyway, and what profound 
conclusions were they drawing? What ex
post facto lessons of history? And that 
crash over the telephone, had that
been the beginning, or had Jack simply 
dropped his eye? I laughed
drunkenly, the eruption paining my head.

Suddenly the shooting ceased and in the 
silence there was the sound
of voices, footfalls, labor.
"Hey, buddy," somebody said beside me, 
"where you going?" It was
Scofield.
"It's either run or get knocked down," 
I said. "I thought you were
still back there."
"I cut out, man. A building two doors 
away started to burn and they
had to git the fire department . . . 
Damn! wasn't for this noise I'd swear
those bullets was mosquitoes."
"Watch out!" I warned, pulling him away 
from where a man lay
propped against a post, tightening a 
tourniquet around his gashed arm.
Scofield flashed his light and for a 
second I saw the black man, his
face gray with shock, watching the 
jetting pulsing of his blood spurting 
into
the street. Then, compelled, I reached 
down and twisted the tourniquet,
feeling the blood warm upon my hand, 
seeing the pulsing cease.
"You done stopped it," a young man 
said, looking down.
"Here," I said, "you take it, hold it 
tight. Get him to a doctor."
"Ain't you a doctor?"
"Me?" I said. "Me? Are you crazy? If 
you want him to live, get him
away from here."
"Albert done gone for one," the boy 
said. "But I thought you was
one. You --"
"No," I said, looking at my bloody 
hands, "no, not me. You hold it
tight until the doctor comes. I 
couldn't cure a headache."
I stood wiping my hands against the 
brief case, looking down at the
big man, his back resting against the 
post with his eyes closed, the boy
holding desperately to the tourniquet 
made of what had been a bright new
tie.
"Come on," I said.
"Say," Scofield said when we were past, 
"wasn't that you that woman
was calling brother back yonder?"
"Brother? No, it must have been some 
other guy."
"You know, man, I think I seen you 
before somewhere. You ever was
in Memphis . . . ? Say, look what's 
coming," he said, pointing, and I looked
through the dark to see a squad of 
white-helmeted policemen charge forward

and break for shelter as a rain of 
bricks showered down from the building
tops. Some of the white helmets, racing 
for the doorways, turned to fire, and
I heard Scofield grunt and go down and 
I dropped beside him, seeing the red
burst of fire and hearing the shrill 
scream, like an arching dive, curving 
from
above to end in a crunching thud in the 
street. It was as though it landed in
my stomach, sickening me, and I 
crouched, looking down past Scofield, 
who
lay just ahead of me, to see the dark 
crushed form from the roof; and farther
away, the body of a cop, his helmet 
making a small white luminous mound
in the dark.
I moved now to see whether Scofield was 
hit, just as he squirmed
around and cursed at the cops who were 
trying to rescue the one who was
down, his voice furious, as he 
stretched full length firing away with a
nickel-plated pistol like that Dupre 
had waved.
"Git the hell down, man," he yelled 
over his shoulder. "I been
wanting to blast 'em a long time."
"No, not with that thing," I said. 
"Let's get out of here."
"Hell, man, I can shoot this thing," he 
said.
I rolled behind a pile of baskets 
filled with rotting chickens now, and
to my left, upon the littered curb, a 
woman and man crouched behind an
upturned delivery cart.
"Dehart," she said, "let's get up on 
the hill, Dehart. Up with the
respectable people!"
"Hill, hell! We stay right here," the 
man said. "This thing's just
starting. If it becomes a sho 'nough 
race riot I want to be here where 
there'll
be some fighting back."
The

words

struck

like

bullets

fired

close

range,

blasting

my

satisfaction to earth. It was as though 
the uttered word had given meaning to
the night, almost as though it had 
created it, brought it into being in the
instant his breath vibrated small 
against the loud, riotous air. And in
defining, in giving organization to the 
fury, it seemed to spin me around, and
in my mind I was looking backward over 
the days since Clifton's death . . .
Could this be the answer, could this be 
what the committee had planned, the
answer to why they'd surrendered our 
influence to Ras? Suddenly I heard the
hoarse explosion of a shotgun, and 
looked past Scofield's glinting pistol 
to the
huddled form from the roof. It was 
suicide, without guns it was suicide, 
and

not even the pawnshops here had guns 
for sale; and yet I knew with a
shattering dread that the uproar which 
for the moment marked primarily the
crash of men against things -- against 
stores, markets -- could swiftly become
the crash of men against men and with 
most of the guns and numbers on
the other side. I could see it now, see 
it clearly and in growing magnitude. It
was not suicide, but murder. The 
committee had planned it. And I had
helped, had been a tool. A tool just at 
the very moment I had thought myself
free. By pretending to agree I had 
indeed agreed, had

made myself

responsible for that huddled form 
lighted by flame and gunfire in the 
street,
and all the others whom now the night 
was making ripe for death.
The brief case swung heavy against my 
leg as I ran, going away,
leaving Scofield cursing his lack of 
bullets behind me, running wildly and
swinging the brief case hard against 
the head of a dog that leaped at me out
of the crowd, sending him yelping away. 
To my right lay a quiet residential
street with trees, and I entered it, 
going toward Seventh Avenue, toward the
district, filled now with horror and 
hatred. They'll pay, they'll pay, I 
thought.
They'll pay!
The street lay dead quiet in the light 
of the lately risen moon, the
gunfire thin and for a moment, distant. 
The rioting seemed in another world.
For a moment I paused beneath a low, 
thickly leaved tree, looking down the
well-kept doily-shadowed walks past the 
silent houses. It was as though the
tenants had vanished, leaving the 
houses silent with all windows shaded,
refugees from a rising flood. Then I 
heard the single footfalls coming
doggedly toward me in the night, an 
eerie slapping sound followed by a
precise and hallucinated cry -"Time's 
flying
Souls dying
The coming of the Lord
Draweth niiiiigh!"
-- as though he had run for days, for 
years. He trotted past where I stood
beneath the tree, his bare feet 
slapping the walk in the silence, going 
for a
few feet and then the high, 
hallucinated cry beginning again.
I ran into the avenue where in the 
light of a flaming liquor store I

saw three old women scurrying toward me 
with raised skirts loaded with
canned goods.
"I can't stop it just yet, but have 
mercy, Lord," one of them said.
"Do, Jesus, do, sweet Jesus . . ."
I moved ahead, the fumes of alcohol and 
burning tar in my nostrils.
Down the avenue to my left a single 
street lamp still glowed where the long
block was intersected on my right by a 
street, and I could see a crowd
rushing a store that faced the 
intersection, moving in, and a 
fusillade of
canned goods, salami, liverwurst, 
hogsheads and chitterlings belching out 
to
those outside and a bag of flour 
bursting white upon them; as now out of
the dark of the intersecting street two 
mounted policemen came at a gallop,
heaving huge and heavy-hooved, charging 
straight into the swarming mass.
And I could see the great forward lunge 
of the horses and the crowd
breaking and rolling back like a wave, 
back, and screaming and cursing, and
some laughing -- back and around and 
out into the avenue, stumbling and
pushing, as the horses, heads high and 
bits froth-flecked, went over the curb
to land stiff-legged and slide over the 
cleared walk as upon ice skates and
past, carried by the force of the 
charge, sideways now, legs stiff, 
sparks flying,
to where another crowd looted another 
store. And my heart tightened as the
first crowd swung imperturbably back to 
their looting with derisive cries, like
sandpipers swinging around to glean the 
shore after a furious wave's
recession.
Cursing Jack and the Brotherhood I 
moved around a steel grill torn
from the front of a pawnshop, seeing 
the troopers galloping back and the
riders lifting the horses to charge 
again, grim and skillful in white steel
helmets, and the charge beginning. This 
time a man went down and I saw a
woman swinging a gleaming frying pan 
hard against the horse's rump and the
horse neighing and beginning to plunge. 
They'll pay, I thought, they'll pay.
They came toward me as I ran, a crowd 
of men and women carrying cases of
beer, cheese, chains of linked sausage, 
watermelons, sacks of sugar, hams,
cornmeal, fuel lamps. If only it could 
stop right here, here; here before the
others came with their guns. I ran.
There was no firing. But when, I 
thought, how long before it starts?
"Git a side of bacon, Joe," a woman 
called. "Git a side of bacon, Joe,
git Wilson's."

"Lord, Lord, Lord," a dark voice called 
from the dark.
I went on, plunged in a sense of 
painful isolation as I reached 125th
Street and started east. A squad of 
mounted police galloped past. Men with
sub-machine guns were guarding a bank 
and a large jewelry store. I moved
out to the center of the street, 
running down the trolley rails.
The moon was high now and before me the 
shattered glass glittered
in the street like the water of a 
flooded river upon the surface of which 
I ran
as in a dream, avoiding by fate alone 
the distorted objects washed away by
the flood. Then suddenly I seemed to 
sink, sucked under: Ahead of me the
body hung, white, naked, and horribly 
feminine from a lamppost. I felt myself
spin around with horror and it was as 
though I had turned some nightmarish
somersault. I whirled, still moving by 
reflex, back-tracking and stopped and
now there was another and another, 
seven-all hanging before a gutted
storefront. I stumbled, hearing the 
cracking of bones underfoot and saw a
physician's skeleton shattered on the 
street, the skull rolling away from the
backbone, as I steadied long enough to 
notice the unnatural stiffness of those
hanging above me. They were mannequins 
-- "Dummies!" I said aloud.
Hairless, bald and sterilely feminine. 
And I recalled the boys in the blonde
wigs, expecting the relief of laughter, 
but suddenly was more devastated by
the humor than by the horror. But are 
they unreal, I thought; are they? What
if one, even one is real -- is . . . 
Sybil? I hugged my brief case, backing
away, and ran . . .

THEY moved in a tight-knit order, 
carrying sticks and clubs, shotguns
and rifles, led by Ras the Exhorter 
become Ras the Destroyer upon a great
black horse. A new Ras of a haughty, 
vulgar dignity, dressed in the costume
of an Abyssinian chieftain; a fur cap 
upon his head, his arm bearing a shield,
a cape made of the skin of some wild 
animal around his shoulders. A figure
more out of a dream than out of Harlem, 
than out of even this Harlem
night, yet real, alive, alarming.
"Come away from that stupid looting," 
he called to a group before a
store. "Come jine with us to burst in 
the armory and get guns and
ammunition!"
And hearing his voice I opened my brief 
case and searched for my

dark glasses, my Rineharts, drawing 
them out only to see the crushed lenses
fall to the street. Rinehart, I 
thought, Rinehart! I turned. The police 
were
back there behind me; if shooting 
started I'd be caught in the crossfire. 
I felt
in my brief case, feeling papers, 
shattered iron, coins, my fingers 
closing over
Tarp's leg chain, and I slipped it over 
my knuckles, trying to think. I closed
the flap, locking it. A new mood was 
settling over me as they came on, a
larger crowd than Ras had ever drawn. I 
went calmly forward, holding the
heavy case but moving with a certain 
new sense of self, and with it a feeling
almost of relief, almost of a sigh. I 
knew suddenly what I had to do, knew it
even before it shaped itself completely 
in my mind.
Someone called, "Look!" and Ras bent 
down from the horse, saw me
and flung, of all things, a spear, and 
I fell forward at the movement of his
arm, catching myself upon my hands as a 
tumbler would, and heard the
shock of it piercing one of the hanging 
dummies. I stood, my brief case
coming with me.
"Betrayer!" Ras shouted.
"It's the brother," someone said. They 
moved up around the horse
excited and not quite decided, and I 
faced him, knowing I was no worse than
he, nor any better, and that all the 
months of illusion and the night of 
chaos
required but a few simple words, a 
mild, even a meek, muted action to clear
the air. To awaken them and me.
"I am no longer their brother," I 
shouted. "They want a race riot and
I am against it. The more of us who are 
killed, the better they like --"
"Ignore his lying tongue," Ras shouted. 
"Hang him up to teach the
black people a lesson, and theer be no 
more traitors. No more Uncle Toms.
Hang him up theer with them blahsted 
dummies!"
"But anyone can see it," I shouted. 
"It's true, I was betrayed by those
who I thought were our friends -- but 
they counted on this man, too. They
needed this destroyer to do their work. 
They deserted you so that in your
despair you'd follow this man to your 
destruction. Can't you see it? They
want you guilty of your own murder, 
your own sacrifice!"
"Grab him!" Ras shouted.
Three men stepped forward and I reached 
up without thinking,
actually a desperate oratorical gesture 
of disagreement and defiance, as I
shouted, "No!" But my hand struck the 
spear and I wrenched it free, gripping

it mid-shaft, point forward. "They want 
this to happen," I said. "They planned
it. They want the mobs to come uptown 
with machine guns and rifles. They
want the streets to flow with blood; 
your blood, black blood and white blood,
so that they can turn your death and 
sorrow and defeat into propaganda. It's
simple, you've known it a long time. It 
goes, 'Use a nigger to catch a nigger.'
Well, they used me to catch you and now 
they're using Ras to do away with
me and to prepare your sacrifice. Don't 
you see it? Isn't it clear . . . ?"
"Hang the lying traitor," Ras shouted. 
"What are you waiting for?"
I saw a group of men start forward.
"Wait," I said. "Then kill me for 
myself, for my own mistake, then
leave it there. Don't kill me for those 
who are downtown laughing at the trick
they played --"
But even as I spoke I knew it was no 
good. I had no words and no
eloquence, and when Ras thundered, 
"Hang him!" I stood there facing them,
and it seemed unreal. I faced them 
knowing that the madman in a foreign
costume was real and yet unreal, 
knowing that he wanted my life, that he
held me responsible for all the nights 
and days and all the suffering and for
all that which I was incapable of 
controlling, and I no hero, but short 
and
dark with only a certain eloquence and 
a bottomless capacity for being a fool
to mark me from the rest; saw them, 
recognized them at last as those whom
I had failed and of whom I was now, 
just now, a leader, though leading
them, running ahead of them, only in 
the stripping away of my illusionment.
I looked at Ras on his horse and at 
their handful of guns and
recognized

the

absurdity

of

the

whole

night

and

of

the

simple

yet

confoundingly complex arrangement of 
hope and desire, fear and hate, that
had brought me here still running, and 
knowing now who I was and where I
was and knowing too that I had no 
longer to run for or from the Jacks and
the Emersons and the Bledsoes and 
Nortons, but only from their confusion,
impatience, and refusal to recognize 
the beautiful absurdity of their 
American
identity and mine. I stood there, 
knowing that by dying, that by being 
hanged
by Ras on this street in this 
destructive night I would perhaps move 
them
one fraction of a bloody step closer to 
a definition of who they were and of
what I was and had been. But the 
definition would have been too narrow; I
was invisible, and hanging would not 
bring me to visibility, even to their
eyes, since they wanted my death not 
for myself alone but for the chase I'd

been on all my life; because of the way 
I'd run, been run, chased, operated,
purged -- although to a great extent I 
could have done nothing else, given
their blindness (didn't they tolerate 
both Rinehart and Bledsoe?) and my
invisibility. And that I, a little 
black man with an assumed name should 
die
because a big black man in his hatred 
and confusion over the nature of a
reality that seemed controlled solely 
by white men whom I knew to be as
blind as he, was just too much, too 
outrageously absurd. And I knew that it
was better to live out one's own 
absurdity than to die for that of 
others,
whether for Ras's or Jack's.
So when Ras yelled, "Hang him!" I let 
fly the spear and it was as
though for a moment I had surrendered 
my life and begun to live again,
watching it catch him as he turned his 
head to shout, ripping through both
cheeks, and saw the surprised pause of 
the crowd as Ras wrestled with the
spear that locked his jaws. Some of the 
men raised their guns, but they were
too close to shoot and I hit the first 
with Tarp's leg chain and the other in
the middle with my brief case, then ran 
through a looted store, hearing the
blanging of the burglar alarm as I 
scrambled over scattered shoes, upturned
showcases, chairs -- back to where I 
saw the moonlight through the rear door
ahead. They came behind me like a draft 
of flames and I led them through
and around to the avenue, and if they'd 
fired they could have had me, but it
was important to them that they hang 
me, lynch me even, since that was the
way they ran, had been taught to run. I 
should die by hanging alone, as
though only hanging would settle 
things, even the score. So I ran 
expecting
death between the shoulder blades or 
through the back of my head, and as I
ran I was trying to get to Mary's. It 
was not a decision of thought but
something I realized suddenly while 
running over puddles of milk in the 
black
street, stopping to swing the heavy 
brief case and the leg chain, slipping 
and
sliding out of their hands.
If only I could turn around and drop my 
arms and say, "Look, men,
give me a break, we're all black folks 
together . . . Nobody cares." Though
now I knew we cared, they at last cared 
enough to act -- so I thought. If
only I could say, "Look, they've played 
a trick on us, the same old trick with
new variations -- let's stop running 
and respect and love one another . . ." 
If
only -- I thought, running into another 
crowd now and thinking I'd gotten
away, only to catch a punch on my jaw 
as one closed in shouting, and

feeling the leg chain bounce as I 
caught his head and spurted forward,
turning out of the avenue only to be 
struck by a spray of water that seemed
to descend from above. It was a main 
that had burst, throwing a fierce
curtain of spray into the night. I was 
going for Mary's but I was moving
downtown through the dripping street 
rather than up, and, as I started
through, a mounted policeman charged 
through the spray, the horse black
and dripping, charging through and 
looming huge and unreal, neighing and
clopping across the pavement upon me 
now as I slipped to my knees and
saw the huge pulsing bulk floating down 
upon and over me, the sound of
hooves and screams and a rush of water 
coming through distantly as though
I sat remote in a padded room, then 
over, almost past, the hair of the tail 
a
fiery lash across my eyes. I stumbled 
about in circles, blindly swinging the
brief case, the image of a fiery 
comet's tail burning my smarting lids; 
turning
and swinging blindly with brief case 
and leg chain and hearing the gallop
begin as I floundered helplessly; and 
now moving straight into the full, naked
force of the water, feeling its power 
like a blow, wet and thudding and cold,
then through it and able partly to see 
just as another horse dashed up and
through, a hunter taking a barrier, the 
rider slanting backward, the horse
rising, then hit and swallowed by the 
rising spray. I stumbled down the
street, the comet tail in my eyes, 
seeing a little better now and looking 
back
to see the water spraying like a mad 
geyser in the moonlight. To Mary, I
thought, to Mary.

THERE were rows of iron fences backed 
by low hedges before the
houses and I stumbled behind them and 
lay panting to rest from the
crushing force of the water. But hardly 
had I settled down, the dry, dog-day
smell of the hedge in my nose, when 
they stopped before the house, leaning
upon the fence. They were passing a 
bottle around and their voices sounded
spent of strong emotion.
"This is some night," one of them said. 
"Ain't this some night?"
"It's 'bout like the rest."
"Why you say that?"
" 'Cause it's fulla fucking and 
fighting and drinking and lying -gimme 
that bottle."

"Yeah, but tonight I seen some things I 
never seen before."
"You think you seen something? Hell, 
you ought to been over on
Lenox about two hours ago. You know 
that stud Ras the Destroyer? Well,
man, he was spitting blood."
"That crazy guy?"
"Hell, yes, man, he had him a big black 
hoss and a fur cap and
some kind of old lion skin or something 
over his shoulders and he was
raising hell. Goddam if he wasn't a 
sight, riding up and down on this ole
hoss, you know, one of the kind that 
pulls vegetable wagons, and he got him
a cowboy saddle and some big spurs."
"Aw naw, man!"
"Hell, yes! Riding up and down the 
block yelling, 'Destroy 'em! Drive
'em out! Burn 'em out! I, Ras, commands 
you.' You get that, man," he said, "
'I, Ras, commands you -- to destroy 
them to the last piece of rotten fish!'
And 'bout that time some joker with a 
big ole Georgia voice sticks his head
out the window and yells, 'Ride 'em, 
cowboy. Give 'em hell and bananas.' And
man, that crazy sonofabitch up there on 
that hoss looking like death eating a
sandwich, he reaches down and comes up 
with a forty-five and starts blazing
up at that window -- And man, talk 
about cutting out! In a second wasn't
nobody left but ole Ras up there on 
that hoss with that lion skin stretched
straight out behind him. Crazy, man. 
Everybody else trying to git some loot
and him and his boys out for blood!"
I lay like a man rescued from drowning, 
listening, still not sure I
was alive.
"I was over there," another voice said. 
"You see him when the
mounted police got after his ass?"
"Hell, naw . . . Here, take a li'l 
taste."
"Well that's when you shoulda seen him. 
When he seen them cops
riding up he reached back of his saddle 
and come up with some kind of old
shield."
"A shield?"
"Hell, yes! One with a spike in the 
middle of it. And that ain't all;
when he sees the cops he calls to one 
of his goddam henchmens to hand
him up a spear, and a little short guy 
run out into the street and give him
one. You know, one of the kind you see 
them African guys carrying in the

moving pictures . . ."
"Where the hell was you, man?"
"Me? I'm over on the side where some 
stud done broke in a store
and is selling cold beer out the window 
-- Done gone into business, man,"
the voice laughed. "I was drinking me 
some Budweiser and digging the doings
-- when here comes the cops up the 
street, riding like cowboys, man; and
when ole Ras-the-what's-his-name sees 
'em he lets out a roar like a lion and
rears way back and starts shooting 
spurs into that boss's ass fast as 
nickels
falling in the subway at going-home 
time -- and gaawd-dam! that's when you
ought to seen him! Say, gimme a taste 
there, fella.
"Thanks. Here he comes bookety-bookety 
with that spear stuck out in
front of him and that shield on his 
arm, charging, man. And he's yelling
something in African or West Indian or 
something and he's got his head
down low like he knew about that shit 
too, man; riding like Earle Sande in
the fifth at Jamaica. That ole black 
hoss let out a whinny and got his head
down -- I don't know where he got that 
sonofabitch -- but, gentlemens, I
swear! When he felt that steel in his 
high behind he came on like Man o'
War going to get his ashes hauled! 
Before the cops knowed what hit 'em Ras
is right in the middle of 'em and one 
cop grabbed for that spear, and ole
Ras swung 'round and bust him across 
the head and the cop goes down and
his hoss rears up, and ole Ras tries 
his and tries to spear him another cop,
and the other hosses is plunging around 
and ole Ras tries to spear him still
another cop, only he's too close and 
the hoss is pooling and snorting and
pissing and shitting, and they swings 
around and the cop is swinging his
pistol and every time he swings ole Ras 
throws up his shield with one arm
and chops at him with the spear with 
the other, and man, you could hear
that gun striking that ole shield like 
somebody dropping tire irons out a
twelve-story window. And you know what, 
when ole Ras saw he was too close
to spear him a cop he wheeled that hoss 
around and rode off a bit and did
him a quick round-about face and 
charged 'em again -- out for blood, man!
Only this time the cops got tired of 
that bullshit and one of 'em started
shooting. And that was the lick! Ole 
Ras didn't have time to git his gun so
he let fly with that spear and you 
could hear him grunt and say something
'bout that cop's kin-folks and then him 
and that hoss shot up the street
leaping like Heigho, the goddam Silver!"

"Man, where'd you come from?"
"It's the truth, man, here's my right 
hand."
They were laughing outside the hedge 
and leaving and I lay in a
cramp, wanting to laugh and yet knowing 
that Ras was not funny, or not
only funny, but dangerous as well, 
wrong but justified, crazy and yet 
coldly
sane . . . Why did they make it seem 
funny, only funny? I thought. And yet
knowing that it was. It was funny and 
dangerous and sad. Jack had seen it,
or had stumbled upon it and used it to 
prepare a sacrifice. And I had been
used as a tool. My grandfather had been 
wrong about yessing them to death
and destruction or else things had 
changed too much since his day.
There was only one way to destroy them. 
I got up from behind the
hedge in the waning moon, wet and 
shaken in the hot air and started out
looking for Jack, still turned around 
in my direction. I moved into the 
street,
listening to the distant sounds of the 
riot and seeing in my mind the image
of two eyes in the bottom of a 
shattered glass.
I kept to the darker side of streets 
and to the silent areas, thinking
that if he wished really to hide his 
strategy he'd appear in the district, 
with a
sound truck perhaps, playing the 
friendly adviser with Wrestrum and 
Tobitt
beside him.
They were in civilian clothes, and I 
thought, Cops -- until I saw the
baseball bat and started to turn, 
hearing, "Hey, you!"
I hesitated.
"What's in that brief case?" they said, 
and if they'd asked me
anything else I might have stood still. 
But at the question a wave of shame
and outrage shook me and I ran, still 
heading for Jack. But I was in strange
territory now and someone, for some 
reason, had removed the manhole cover
and I felt myself plunge down, down; a 
long drop that ended upon a load of
coal that sent up a cloud of dust, and 
I lay in the black dark upon the black
coal no longer running, hiding or 
concerned, hearing the shifting of the 
coal,
as from somewhere above their voices 
came floating down.
"You see the way he went down, zoom! I 
was just fixing to slug the
bastard."
"You hit him?"
"I don't know."
"Say, Joe, you think the bastard's 
dead?"

"Maybe. He sure is in the dark though. 
You can't even see his eyes."
"Nigger in the coal pile, eh, Joe?"
Someone hollered down the hole, "Hey, 
black boy. Come on out. We
want to see what's in that brief case."
"Come down and get me," I said.
"What's in that brief case?"
"You," I said, suddenly laughing. "What 
do you think of that?"
"Me?"
"All of you," I said.
"You're crazy," he said.
"But I still have you in this brief 
case!"
"What'd you steal?"
"Can't you see?" I said. "Light a 
match."
"What the hell's he talking about, Joe?"
"Strike a match, the boogy's nuts."
High above I saw the small flame 
sputter into light. They stood
heads down, as in prayer, unable to see 
me back in the coal.
"Come on down," I said. "Hal Ha! I've 
had you in my brief case all
the time and you didn't know me then 
and can't see me now."
"You sonofabitch!" one of them called, 
outraged. Then the match
went out and I heard something fall 
softly upon the coal near by. They were
talking above.
"You goddam black nigger sonofabitch," 
someone called, "see how you
like this," and I heard the cover 
settle over the manhole with a dull 
clang.
Fine bits of dirt showered down as they 
stamped upon the lid and for a
moment I sent coal sliding in wild 
surprise, looking up, up through black
space to where for a second the dim 
light of a match sank through a circle
of holes in the steel. Then I thought, 
This is the way it's always been, only
now I know it -- and rested back, calm 
now, placing the brief case beneath
my head. I could open it in the 
morning, push off the lid. Now I was 
tired,
too tired; my mind retreating, the 
image of the two glass eyes running
together like blobs of melting lead. 
Here it was as though the riot was gone
and I felt the tug of sleep, seemed to 
move out upon black water.
It's a kind of death without hanging, I 
thought, a death alive. In the
morning I'll remove the lid . . . Mary, 
I should have gone to Mary's. I would

go now to Mary's in the only way that I 
could . . . I moved off over the
black water, floating, sighing . . . 
sleeping invisibly.

BUT I was never to reach Mary's, and I 
was over-optimistic about
removing the steel cap in the morning. 
Great invisible waves of time flowed
over me, but that morning never came. 
There was no morning nor light of
any kind to awaken me and I slept on 
and on until finally I was aroused by
hunger. Then I was up in the dark and 
blundering around, feeling rough
walls and the coal giving way beneath 
each step like treacherous sand. I tried
to reach above me but found only space,

unbroken and impenetrable. Then I

tried to find the usual ladder that 
leads out of such holes, but there was
none. I had to have a light, and now on 
hands and knees, holding tight to
my brief case, I searched the coal 
until I found the folder of matches the
men had dropped -- how long ago had 
that been? -- but there were only
three and to save them I started 
searching for paper to make a torch, 
feeling
about slowly over the coal pile. I 
needed just one piece of paper to light 
my
way out of the hole, but there was 
nothing. Next I searched my pockets,
finding not even a bill, or an 
advertising folder, or a Brotherhood 
leaflet. Why
had I destroyed Rinehart's throwaway? 
Well, there was only one thing to do
if I was to make a torch. I'd have to 
open my brief case. In it were the only
papers I had.
I started with my high-school diploma, 
applying one precious match
with a feeling of remote irony, even 
smiling as I saw the swift but feeble
light push back the gloom. I was in a 
deep basement, full of shapeless
objects that extended farther than I 
could see, and I realized that to light 
my
way out I would have to burn every 
paper in the brief case. I moved slowly
off, toward the darker blackness, 
lighting my way by these feeble 
torches. The
next to go was Clifton's doll, but it 
burned so stubbornly that I reached
inside the case for something else. 
Then by the light of the 
smoke-sputtering
doll I opened a folded page. It was the 
anonymous letter, which burned so
quickly that as it flamed I hurriedly 
unfolded another: It was that slip upon
which Jack had written my Brotherhood 
name. I could still smell Emma's
perfume even in the dampness of the 
cellar. And now seeing the handwriting
of the two in the consuming flames I 
burned my hand and slipped to my

knees, staring. The handwriting was the 
same. I knelt there, stunned,
watching the flames consume them. That 
he, or anyone at that late date,
could have named me and set me running 
with one and the same stroke of
the pen was too much. Suddenly I began 
to scream, getting up in the
darkness and plunging wildly about, 
bumping against walls, scattering coal,
and in my anger extinguishing my feeble 
light.
But still whirling on in the blackness, 
knocking against the rough
walls of a narrow passage, banging my 
head and cursing, I stumbled down
and plunged against some kind of 
partition and sailed headlong, coughing 
and
sneezing, into another dimensionless 
room, where I continued to roll about
the floor in my outrage. How long this 
kept up, I do not know. It might
have been days, weeks; I lost all sense 
of time. And everytime I paused to
rest, the outrage revived and I went 
off again. Then, finally, when I could
barely move, something seemed to say, 
"That's enough, don't kill yourself.
You've run enough, you're through with 
them at last," and I collapsed, face
forward and lay there beyond the point 
of exhaustion, too tired to close my
eyes. It was a state neither of 
dreaming nor of waking, but somewhere in
between, in which I was caught like 
Trueblood's jaybird that yellow jackets
had paralyzed in every part but his 
eyes.

But somehow the floor had now turned to 
sand and the darkness to
light, and I lay the prisoner of a 
group consisting of Jack and old Emerson
and Bledsoe and Norton and Ras and the 
school superintendent and a
number of others whom I failed to 
recognize, but all of whom had run me,
who now pressed around me as I lay 
beside a river of black water, near
where an armored bridge arched sharply 
away to where I could not see. And
I was protesting their holding me and 
they were demanding that I return to
them and were annoyed with my refusal.
"No," I said. "I'm through with all 
your illusions and lies, I'm
through running."
"Not quite," Jack said above the 
others' angry demands, "but you
soon will be, unless you return. Refuse 
and we'll free you of your illusions all
right."
"No, thank you; I'll free myself," I 
said, struggling to rise from the

cutting sand.
But now they came forward with a knife, 
holding me; and I felt the
bright red pain and they took the two 
bloody blobs and cast them over the
bridge, and out of my anguish I saw 
them curve up and catch beneath the
apex of the curving arch of the bridge, 
to hang there,

dripping down

through the sunlight into the dark red 
water. And while the others laughed,
before my pain-sharpened eyes the whole 
world was slowly turning red.
"Now you're free of illusions," Jack 
said, pointing to my seed wasting
upon the air. "How does it feel to be 
free of one's illusions?"
And I looked up through a pain so 
intense now that the air seemed
to roar with the clanging of metal, 
hearing, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE
FREE OF ILLUSION . . .
And now I answered, "Painful and 
empty," as I saw a glittering
butterfly circle three times around my 
blood-red parts, up there beneath the
bridge's high arch. "But look," I said 
pointing. And they looked and laughed,
and suddenly seeing their satisfied 
faces and understanding, I gave a 
Bledsoe
laugh, startling them. And Jack came 
forward, curious.
"Why do you laugh?" he said.
"Because at a price I now see that 
which I couldn't see," I said.
"What does he think he sees?" they said.
And Jack came closer, threatening, and 
I laughed. "I'm not afraid
now," I said. "But if you'll look, 
you'll see . . . It's not invisible . . 
."
"See what?" they said.
"That there hang not only my 
generations wasting upon the water --"
And now the pain welled up and I could 
no longer see them.
"But what? Go on," they said.
"But your sun . . ."
"Yes?"
"And your moon . . ."
"He's crazy!"
"Your world . . ."
"I knew he was a mystic idealist!" 
Tobitt said.
"Still," I said, "there's your 
universe, and that drip-drop upon the
water you hear is all the history 
you've made, all you're going to make. 
Now
laugh, you scientists. Let's hear you 
laugh!"

And high above me now the bridge seemed 
to move off to where I
could not see, striding like a robot, 
an iron man, whose iron legs clanged
doomfully as it moved. And then I 
struggled up, full of sorrow and pain,
shouting, "No, no, we must stop him!"

And I awoke in the blackness.
Fully awake now, I simply lay there as 
though paralyzed. I could
think of nothing else to do. Later I 
would try to find my way out, but now I
could only lie on the floor, reliving 
the dream. All their faces were so vivid
that they seemed to stand before me 
beneath a spotlight. They were all up
there somewhere, making a mess of the 
world. Well, let them. I was through
and, in spite of the dream, I was whole.
And now I realized that I couldn't 
return to Mary's, or to any part of
my old life. I could approach it only 
from the outside, and I had been as
invisible to Mary as I had been to the 
Brotherhood. No, I couldn't return to
Mary's, or to the campus, or to the 
Brotherhood, or home. I could only move
ahead or stay here, underground. So I 
would stay here until I was chased
out. Here, at least, I could try to 
think things out in peace, or, if not in
peace, in quiet. I would take up 
residence underground. The end was in 
the
beginning.

Epilogue
So there you have all of it that's 
important. Or at least you almost
have it. I'm an invisible man and it 
placed me in a hole -- or showed me the
hole I was in, if you will -- and I 
reluctantly accepted the fact. What else
could I have done? Once you get used to 
it, reality is as irresistible as a 
club,
and I was clubbed into the cellar 
before I caught the hint. Perhaps 
that's the
way it had to be; I don't know. Nor do 
I know whether accepting the lesson
has placed me in the rear or in the 
avant-garde. That, perhaps, is a lesson

for history, and I'll leave such 
decisions to Jack and his ilk while I 
try
belatedly to study the lesson of my own 
life.
Let me be honest with you -- a feat 
which, by the way, I find of the
utmost difficulty. When one is 
invisible he finds such problems as 
good and
evil, honesty and dishonesty, of such 
shifting shapes that he confuses one
with the other, depending upon who 
happens to be looking through him at
the time. Well, now I've been trying to 
look through myself, and there's a
risk in it. I was never more hated than 
when I tried to be honest. Or when,
even as just now I've tried to 
articulate exactly what I felt to be 
the truth.
No one was satisfied -- not even I. On 
the other hand, I've never been more
loved and appreciated than when I tried 
to "justify" and affirm someone's
mistaken beliefs; or when I've tried to 
give my friends the incorrect, absurd
answers they wished to hear. In my 
presence they could talk and agree with
themselves, the world was nailed down, 
and they loved it. They received a
feeling of security. But here was the 
rub: Too often, in order to justify 
them,
I had to take myself by the throat and 
choke myself until my eyes bulged
and my tongue hung out and wagged like 
the door of an empty house in a
high wind. Oh, yes, it made them happy 
and it made me sick. So I became
ill of affirmation, of saying "yes" 
against the nay-saying of my stomach -- 
not
to mention my brain.
There is, by the way, an area in which 
a man's feelings are more
rational than his mind, and it is 
precisely in that area that his will is 
pulled
in several directions at the same time. 
You might sneer at this, but I know
now. I was pulled this way and that for 
longer than I can remember. And
my problem was that I always tried to 
go in everyone's way but my own. I
have also been called one thing and 
then another while no one really wished
to hear what I called myself. So after 
years of trying to adopt the opinions of
others I finally rebelled. I am an 
invisible man. Thus I have come a long 
way
and returned and boomeranged a long way 
from the point in society toward
which I originally aspired.
So I took to the cellar; I hibernated. 
I got away from it all. But that
wasn't enough. I couldn't be still even 
in hibernation. Because, damn it,
there's the mind, the mind. It wouldn't 
let me rest. Gin, jazz and dreams
were not enough. Books were not enough. 
My belated appreciation of the
crude joke that had kept me running, 
was not enough. And my mind

revolved again and again back to my 
grandfather. And, despite the farce that
ended my attempt to say "yes" to the 
Brotherhood, I'm still plagued by his
deathbed advice . . . Perhaps he hid 
his meaning deeper than I thought,
perhaps his anger threw me off -- I 
can't decide. Could he have meant 
-hell, he must have meant the 
principle, that we were to affirm the 
principle
on which the country was built and not 
the men, or at least not the men
who did the violence. Did he mean say 
"yes" because he knew that the
principle was greater than the men, 
greater than the numbers and the vicious
power and all the methods used to 
corrupt its name? Did he mean to affirm
the principle, which they themselves 
had dreamed into being out of the chaos
and

darkness

of

the

feudal

past,

and

which

they

had

violated

and

compromised to the point of absurdity 
even in their own corrupt minds? Or
did he mean that we had to take the 
responsibility for all of it, for the 
men
as well as the principle, because we 
were the heirs who must use the
principle because no other fitted our 
needs? Not for the power or for
vindication, but because we, with the 
given circumstance of our origin, could
only thus find transcendence? Was it 
that we of all, we, most of all, had to
affirm the principle, the plan in whose 
name we had been brutalized and
sacrificed -- not because we would 
always be weak nor because we were
afraid or opportunistic, but because we 
were older than they, in the sense of
what it took to live in the world with 
others and because they had exhausted
in us, some -- not much, but some -- of 
the human greed and smallness, yes,
and the fear and superstition that had 
kept them running. (Oh, yes, they're
running too, running all over 
themselves.) Or was it, did he mean 
that we
should affirm the principle because we, 
through no fault of our own, were
linked to all the others in the loud, 
clamoring semi-visible world, that world
seen only as a fertile field for 
exploitation by Jack and his kind, and 
with
condescension by Norton and his, who 
were tired of being the mere pawns in
the futile game of "making history"? 
Had he seen that for these too we had
to say "yes" to the principle, lest 
they turn upon us to destroy both it and
us?
"Agree 'em to death and destruction," 
grandfather had advised. Hell,
weren't they their own death and their 
own destruction except as the
principle lived in them and in us? And 
here's the cream of the joke: Weren't
we part of them as well as apart from 
them and subject to die when they

died? I can't figure it out; it escapes 
me. But what do I really want, I've
asked myself. Certainly not the freedom 
of a Rinehart or the power of a Jack,
nor simply the freedom not to run. No, 
but the next step I couldn't make, so
I've remained in the hole.
I'm not blaming anyone for this state 
of affairs, mind you; nor
merely crying mea culpa. The fact is 
that you carry part of your sickness
within you, at least I do as an 
invisible man. I carried my sickness and
though for a long time I tried to place 
it in the outside world, the attempt to
write it down shows me that at least 
half of it lay within me. It came upon
me slowly, like that strange disease 
that affects those black men whom you
see turning slowly from black to 
albino, their pigment disappearing as 
under
the radiation of some cruel, invisible 
ray. You go along for years knowing
something is wrong, then suddenly you 
discover that you're as transparent as
air. At first you tell yourself that 
it's all a dirty joke, or that it's due 
to the
"political situation." But deep down 
you come to suspect that you're yourself
to blame, and you stand naked and 
shivering before the millions of eyes 
who
look through you unseeingly. That is 
the real soul-sickness, the spear in the
side, the drag by the neck

through

the mob-angry

town, the Grand

Inquisition, the embrace of the Maiden, 
the rip in the belly with the guts
spilling out, the trip to the chamber 
with the deadly gas that ends in the
oven so hygienically clean -- only it's 
worse because you continue stupidly to
live. But live you must, and you can 
either make passive love to your
sickness or burn it out and go on to 
the next conflicting phase.
Yes, but what is the next phase? How 
often have I tried to find it!
Over and over again I've gone up above 
to seek it out. For, like almost
everyone else in our country, I started 
out with my share of optimism. I
believed in hard work and progress and 
action, but now, after first being
"for" society and then "against" it, I 
assign myself no rank or any limit, and
such an attitude is very much against 
the trend of the times. But my world
has become one of infinite 
possibilities. What a phrase -- still 
it's a good
phrase and a good view of life, and a 
man shouldn't accept any other; that
much I've learned underground. Until 
some gang succeeds in putting the
world in a strait jacket, its 
definition is possibility. Step outside 
the narrow
borders of what men call reality and 
you step into chaos -- ask Rinehart, 
he's
a master of it -- or imagination. That 
too I've learned in the cellar, and not

by deadening my sense of perception; 
I'm invisible, not blind.
No indeed, the world is just as 
concrete, ornery, vile and sublimely
wonderful as before, only now I better 
understand my relation to it and it to
me. I've come a long way from those 
days when, full of illusion, I lived a
public life and attempted to function 
under the assumption that the world
was solid and all the relationships 
therein. Now I know men are different 
and
that all life is divided and that only 
in division is there true health. Hence
again I have stayed in my hole, because 
up above there's an increasing
passion to make men conform to a 
pattern. Just as in my nightmare, Jack
and the boys are waiting with their 
knives, looking for the slightest 
excuse to
. . . well, to "ball the jack," and I 
do not refer to the old dance step,
although what they're doing is making 
the old eagle rock dangerously.
Whence all this passion toward 
conformity anyway? -- diversity is the
word. Let man keep his many parts and 
you'll have no tyrant states. Why, if
they follow this conformity business 
they'll end up by forcing me, an 
invisible
man, to become white, which is not a 
color but the lack of one. Must I strive
toward colorlessness? But seriously, 
and without snobbery, think of what the
world would lose if that should happen. 
America is woven of many strands; I
would recognize them and let it so 
remain. It's "winner take nothing" that 
is
the great truth of our country or of 
any country. Life is to be lived, not
controlled; and humanity is won by 
continuing to play in face of certain
defeat. Our fate is to become one, and 
yet many -- This is not prophecy, but
description. Thus one of the greatest 
jokes in the world is the spectacle of
the whites busy escaping blackness and 
becoming blacker every day, and the
blacks striving toward whiteness, 
becoming quite dull and gray. None of us
seems to know who he is or where he's 
going.
Which reminds me of something that 
occurred the other day in the
subway. At first I saw only an old 
gentleman who for the moment was lost. I
knew he was lost, for as I looked down 
the platform I saw him approach
several people and turn away without 
speaking. He's lost, I thought, and 
he'll
keep coming until he sees me, then 
he'll ask his direction. Maybe there's 
an
embarrassment in it if he admits he's 
lost to a strange white man. Perhaps to
lose a sense of where you are implies 
the danger of losing a sense of who
you are. That must be it, I thought -- 
to lose your direction is to lose your
face. So here he comes to ask his 
direction from the lost, the invisible. 
Very

well, I've learned to live without 
direction. Let him ask.
But then he was only a few feet away 
and I recognized him; it was
Mr. Norton. The old gentleman was 
thinner and wrinkled now but as dapper
as ever. And seeing him made all the 
old life live in me for an instant, and 
I
smiled with tear-stinging eyes. Then it 
was over, dead, and when he asked
me how to get to Centre Street, I 
regarded him with mixed feelings.
"Don't you know me?" I said.
"Should I?" he said.
"You see me?" I said, watching him 
tensely.
"Why, of course -- Sir, do you know the 
way to Centre Street?"
"So. Last time it was the Golden Day, 
now it's Centre Street. You've
retrenched, sir. But don't you know who 
I am?"
"Young man, I'm in a hurry," he said, 
cupping a hand to his ear.
"Why should I know you?"
"Because I'm your destiny."
"My destiny, did you say?" He gave me a 
puzzled stare, backing
away. "Young man, are you well? Which 
train did you say I should take?"
"I didn't say," I said, shaking my 
head. "Now, aren't you ashamed?"
"Ashamed? ASHAMED!" he said indignantly.
I laughed, suddenly taken by the idea. 
"Because, Mr. Norton, if you
don't know where you are, you probably 
don't know who you are. So you
came to me out of shame. You are 
ashamed, now aren't you?"
"Young man, I've lived too long in this 
world to be ashamed of
anything. Are you light-headed from 
hunger? How do you know my name?"
"But I'm your destiny, I made you. Why 
shouldn't I know you?" I
said, walking closer and seeing him 
back against a pillar. He looked around
like a cornered animal. He thought I 
was mad.
"Don't be afraid, Mr. Norton," I said. 
"There's a guard down the
platform there. You're safe. Take any 
train; they all go to the Golden D --"
But now an express had rolled up and 
the old man was disappearing
quite spryly inside one of its doors. I 
stood there laughing hysterically. I
laughed all the way back to my hole.
But after I had laughed I was thrown 
back on my thoughts -- how
had it all happened? And I asked myself 
if it were only a joke and I couldn't
answer. Since then I've sometimes been 
overcome with a passion to return

into that "heart of darkness" across 
the Mason-Dixon line, but then I remind
myself that the true darkness lies 
within my own mind, and the idea loses
itself in the gloom. Still the passion 
persists. Sometimes I feel the need to
reaffirm all of it, the whole unhappy 
territory and all the things loved and
unlovable in it, for all of it is part 
of me. Till now, however, this is as 
far as
I've ever gotten, for all life seen 
from the hole of invisibility is absurd.
So why do I write, torturing myself to 
put it down? Because in spite
of myself I've learned some things. 
Without the possibility of action, all
knowledge comes to one labeled "file 
and forget," and I can neither file nor
forget. Nor will certain ideas forget 
me; they keep filing away at my 
lethargy,
my complacency. Why should I be the one 
to dream this nightmare? Why
should I be dedicated and set aside -- 
yes, if not to at least tell a few 
people
about it? There seems to be no escape. 
Here I've set out to throw my anger
into the world's face, but now that 
I've tried to put it all down the old
fascination with playing a role 
returns, and I'm drawn upward again. So 
that
even before I finish I've failed (maybe 
my anger is too heavy; perhaps, being
a talker, I've used too many words). 
But I've failed. The very act of trying 
to
put it all down has confused me and 
negated some of the anger and some of
the bitterness. So it is that now I 
denounce and defend, or feel prepared to
defend. I condemn and affirm, say no 
and say yes, say yes and say no. I
denounce because though implicated and 
partially responsible, I have been
hurt to the point of abysmal pain, hurt 
to the point of invisibility. And I
defend because in spite of all I find 
that I love. In order to get some of it
down I have to love. I sell you no 
phony forgiveness, I'm a desperate man 
-but too much of your life will be 
lost, its meaning lost, unless you 
approach
it as much through love as through 
hate. So I approach it through division.
So I denounce and I defend and I hate 
and I love.
Perhaps that makes me a little bit as 
human as my grandfather.
Once I thought my grandfather incapable 
of thoughts about humanity, but I
was wrong. Why should an old slave use 
such a phrase as, "This and this or
this has made me more human," as I did 
in my arena speech? Hell, he never
had any doubts about his humanity -- 
that was left to his "free" offspring. 
He
accepted his humanity just as he 
accepted the principle. It was his, and 
the
principle lives on in all its human and 
absurd diversity. So now having tried
to put it down I have disarmed myself 
in the process. You won't believe in

my invisibility and you'll fail to see 
how any principle that applies to you
could apply to me. You'll fail to see 
it even though death waits for both of 
us
if you don't. Nevertheless, the very 
disarmament has brought me to a
decision. The hibernation is over. I 
must shake off the old skin and come up
for breath. There's a stench in the 
air, which, from this distance 
underground,
might be the smell either of death or 
of spring -- I hope of spring. But don't
let me trick you, there is a death in 
the smell of spring and in the smell of
thee as in the smell of me. And if 
nothing more, invisibility has taught my
nose to classify the stenches of death.
In going underground, I whipped it all 
except the mind, the mind.
And the mind that has conceived a plan 
of living must never lose sight of
the chaos against which that pattern 
was conceived. That goes for societies 
as
well as for individuals. Thus, having 
tried to give pattern to the chaos which
lives within the pattern of your 
certainties, I must come out, I must 
emerge.
And there's still a conflict within me: 
With Louis Armstrong one half of me
says, "Open the window and let the foul 
air out," while the other says, "It
was good green corn before the 
harvest." Of course Louis was kidding, 
he
wouldn't have thrown old Bad Air out, 
because it would have broken up the
music and the dance, when it was the 
good music that came from the bell of
old Bad Air's horn that counted. Old 
Bad Air is still around with his music
and his dancing and his diversity, and 
I'll be up and around with mine. And,
as I said before, a decision has been 
made. I'm shaking off the old skin and
I'll leave it here in the hole. I'm 
coming out, no less invisible without 
it, but
coming

out

nevertheless.

And

I

suppose

it's

damn

well

time.

Even

hibernations can be overdone, come to 
think of it. Perhaps that's my greatest
social crime, I've overstayed my 
hibernation, since there's a 
possibility that
even an invisible man has a socially 
responsible role to play.
"Ah," I can hear you say, "so it was 
all a build-up to bore us with
his buggy jiving. He only wanted us to 
listen to him rave!" But only partially
true: Being invisible and without 
substance, a disembodied voice, as it 
were,
what else could I do? What else but try 
to tell you what was really
happening when your eyes were looking 
through? And it is this which
frightens me:
Who knows but that, on the lower 
frequencies, I speak for you?
