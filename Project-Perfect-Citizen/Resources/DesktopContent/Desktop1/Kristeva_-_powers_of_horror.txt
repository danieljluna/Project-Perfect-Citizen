Translator's Note

When the original version of this book 
was published in
France in 1980, critics sensed that it 
marked a turning point in
Julia Kristeva's writing. Her concerns 
seemed less arcane, her
presentation more appealingly worked 
out; as Guy Scarpetta
put it in he Nouvel Observateur (May 
19, 1980), she now introduced into 
"theoretical rigor an effective measure 
of seduction."
Actually, no sudden change has taken 
place: the features that
are noticeable in Powers of Horror were 
already in evidence in
several earlier essays, some of which 
have been translated in
Desire in Language (Columbia University 
Press, 1980). She herself pointed out 
in the preface to that collection, 
"Readers will
also notice that a change in writing 
takes place as the work
progresses" (p. ix).
One would assume such a change has made 
the translator's
task less arduous; in one sense it has, 
but it also produced a
different set of difficulties. As 
sentences become more metaphorical, 
more "literary" if you wish, one is 
liable to forget
that they still are conceptually very 
precise. In other words,
meaning emerges out of both the 
standard denotation(s) and
the connotations suggested by the 
material shape of a given
word. And it emerges not solely because 
of the reader's creativity, as happens 
in poetic language, but because it was 
put
there in the first place. For instance, 
"un etre altere" means
either a changed, adulterated being or 
an avid, thirsty being;
mindful, however, of the unchanged 
presence of the Latin root,
alter, Kristeva also intends it to mean 
"being for the other."
This gives the phrase a special twist, 
and it takes a reader more
imaginative than I am to catch it.
As Kristeva's writing evolves, it also 
displays a greater variety

viii

TRANSLATOR'S NOTE

in tone. In this essay it includes the 
colloquial and the formal,
the lyrical and the matter-of-fact, the 
concrete and the abstract.
I resisted the temptation to unify her 
style and tried as much
as possible to preserve the variety of 
the original. Only in a few
instances, when a faithful rendition 
would in my opinion have
sounded incongruous (e.g., translating 
petard, which she borrows from the text 
of a Celine novel, as "gat" or "rod"), 
did
I consciously neutralize her prose.
A particularly vexing problem stems 
from the nature of the
French language and its limited 
vocabulary as compared to
English; words tend to point in a 
greater number of different
directions. Usually, in expository 
prose, the context removes
the ambiguities that poetic language 
thrives on. Kristeva is not
averse to using polysemy to her 
advantage, as other French
theorists like Derrida and Lacan have 
also done. The French
word propre, for instance, has kept the 
meaning of the Latin
proprius (one's own, characteristic, 
proper) and also acquired
a new one: clean. At first, in Powers 
of Horror, the criteria of
expository prose seemed to apply, but 
in several instances I
began to have my doubts about this. 
When I asked Kristeva
which meaning she intended the answer 
was, both. As a result
I decided to use the rather cumbersome 
"one's own clean and
proper body" to render the French corps 
propre, sacrificing elegance for the 
sake of clarity and fullness of meaning.
Examining my translation carefully, one 
is apt to notice anomalies in the text 
of the quotations. There are two 
reasons for
this. When the original is not in 
French, Kristeva cites a published 
French translation and I refer to a 
published English one
when available. Discrepancies are 
inevitable and for the most
part inconsequential. In the case of 
Freud's Totem and Taboo,
however, the French version, in the 
excerpts quoted here, contains a couple 
of mistranslated words: Inzestscheu 
becomes
"phobie de l'inceste" instead of the 
more accurate "incest
dread," and Genussgefahig gets 
afflicted with the connotation
of "objets comestibles" that belongs to 
Geniessbar instead of the
more general and accurate "capable of 
enjoyment" of the English version. 
While this has required some vocabulary 
adjustment, it does not affect 
Kristeva's argument. Where Hegel's

TRANSLATOR'S NOTE

works are concerned the situation is 
even more troublesome,
for discrepancies between French and 
English translations are
considerable. Referring back to the 
German text of Vorlesungen
tiber die Philosophic der Religion I 
find that the English text is
faithful to it. What apparently 
happened is that the French translation 
was made from an earlier version of the 
Lectures, which,
like Saussure's famous Cours de 
linguistique generate, was published by 
Hegel's students after his death. The 
second edition,
on which the English version is based, 
is presumably an improved one—but that 
need not concern us here. In the 
excerpts
quoted by Kristeva, the meaning is 
essentially the same even
though the wording differs and in one 
instance a metaphorical
development has been eliminated.
When several translations are 
available, as they are for Sophocles, I 
used the one that seemed closest to the 
one used by
Kristeva. For the Bible, I relied on 
the King James version;
minor differences between biblical and 
anthropological terminology should pose 
no problem, and the reader will readily 
see
that the latter's pure/impure 
distinction corresponds to the biblical 
contrast between clean and unclean.
For an original quotation from the 
French, I have also used
available published translations. 
Working with Celine's novels,
however, translators have endeavored to 
produce effective English-language 
fiction. As a result they were 
occasionally led to
stray from a literal version of the 
text—and rightly so. On the
other hand, for the purpose of 
Kristeva's analysis, there are
times when close attention to material 
details of the text is
essential. I have therefore, in a 
number of instances, had to
modify the published translation—but 
that should not be seen
as a reflection on their quality. On a 
few occasions, though,
especially where the early novels are 
involved, translators have
tended to be squeamish; thus, in 
Journey to the End of the Night,
the statement pertaining to women in 
wartime, "la guerre porte
aux ovaires," becomes, "war goes 
straight to their tummies."
I naturally put the ovaries back in.
Throughout this essay, Kristeva plays 
with the titles of
Celine's novels (and a few others: 
Robert Musil's The Man
Without Qualities makes a fleeting 
appearance toward the end).

TRANSLATOR'S NOTE

Journey to the End of the Night is 
easily recognizable; the title
From Castle to Castle, in this 
connection, needs to be changed
to the more literal, "From One Castle 
to an Other," which
produced the title of an earlier essay, 
"From One Identity to
an Other" (collected in Desire in 
Language); I have rendered the
untranslated Feerie pour une autrefois 
as "Enchantment for Some
Other Time." For some features of her 
terminology, readers
should consult the "Notes on the 
Translation and on Terminology" that 
appeared in Desire in Language. Here, 
however,
instead of invariably rendering 
"ecriture" as "writing," I have
attempted to distinguish between the 
weak and the strong
meanings of the French word. For the 
latter I used the term
"scription," which I had introduced in 
my French Fiction Today
(Rutgers University Press, 1972). There 
are in Powers of Horror
a few additional items of Lacanian 
vocabulary that the context
should clarify. The object a is 
mentioned twice, and it could
be puzzling. A few lines from Stuart 
Schneiderman's Returning
to Freud (Yale University Press, 1980) 
might prove helpful: "For
the psychoanalyst the important object 
is the lost object, the
object always desired and never 
attained, the object that causes
the subject to desire in cases where he 
can never gain the satisfaction of 
possessing the object. Any object the 
subject desires
will never be anything other than a 
substitute for the object a."
I should like to thank those who have 
given assistance in
areas I am less familiar with: Stuart 
Schneiderman for the vocabulary of 
psychoanalysis, Robert Austerlitz for 
that of linguistics, Marvin I. Herzog 
for Hebrew terms, Robert D. Cumming for 
philosophy, and of course Julia 
Kristeva herself for
clarifying a number of difficulties. I 
should point out, however,
that while I sought assistance whenever 
I realized I had met
with a problem, there may well have 
been problems I did not
identify and on which I foundered. In 
such instances and in all
others where mistranslations occur the 
responsibility is mine
alone.

POWERS OF HORROR
An Essay on Abjection

I

APPROACHING ABJECTION
No Beast is there without glimmer of 
infinity,
No eye so vile nor abject that brushes 
not
Against lightning from on high, now 
tender, now fierce.
Victor Hugo, La Legende des siecles

NEITHER SUBJECT NOR OBJECT
There looms, within abjection, one of 
those violent, dark revolts of being, 
directed against a threat that seems to 
emanate
from an exorbitant outside or inside, 
ejected beyond the scope
of the possible, the tolerable, the 
thinkable. It lies there, quite
close, but it cannot be assimilated. It 
beseeches, worries, and
fascinates desire, which, nevertheless, 
does not let itself be seduced. 
Apprehensive, desire turns aside; 
sickened, it rejects. A
certainty protects it from the 
shameful—a certainty of which
it is proud holds on to it. But 
simultaneously, just the same,
that impetus, that spasm, that leap is 
drawn toward an elsewhere
as tempting as it is condemned. 
Unflaggingly, like an inescapable 
boomerang, a vortex of summons and 
repulsion places the
one haunted by it literally beside 
himself.
When I am beset by abjection, the 
twisted braid of affects
and thoughts I call by such a name does 
not have, properly
speaking, a definable object. The 
abject is not an ob-ject facing
me, which I name or imagine. Nor is it 
an ob-jest, an otherness
ceaselessly fleeing in a systematic 
quest of desire. What is abject
is not my correlative, which, providing 
me with someone or
something else as support, would allow 
me to be more or less
detached and autonomous. The abject has 
only one quality of
the object—that of being opposed to I. 
If the object, however,
through its opposition, settles me 
within the fragile texture of

2

APPROACHING ABJECTION

a desire for meaning, which, as a 
matter of fact, makes me
ceaselessly and infinitely homologous 
to it, what is abject, on
the contrary, the jettisoned object, is 
radically excluded and
draws me toward the place_where meaning 
collapses. A certain
"ego" that merged with its master, a 
superego, has flatly driven
it away. It lies outside, beyond the 
set, and does not seem to
agree to the latter's rules of the 
game. And yet, from its place
of banishment, the abject does not 
cease challenging its master.
Without a sign (for him), it beseeches 
a discharge, a convulsion,
a crying out. To each ego its object, 
to each superego its abject.
It is not the white expanse or slack 
boredom of repression, not
the translations and transformations of 
desire that wrench bodies, nights, and 
discourse; rather it is a brutish 
suffering that,
"I" puts up with, sublime and 
devastated, for "I" deposits it
to the father's account [verse au 
pere—pere-uersion]: I endure
it, for I imagine that such is the 
desire of the other. A massive
and sudden emergence of uncanniness, 
which, familiar as it
might have been in an opaque and 
forgotten life, now harries
me as radically separate, loathsome. 
Not me. Not that. But not
nothing, either. A "something" that I 
do not recognize as a
thing. A weight of meaninglessness, 
about which there is nothing 
insignificant, and which crushes me. On 
the edge of nonexistence and 
hallucination, of a reality that, if I 
acknowledge
it, annihilates me. There, abject and 
abjection are my safeguards. The 
primers of my culture.
THE IMPROPER/UNCLEAN
Loathing an item of food, a piece of 
filth, waste, or dung. The
spasms and vomiting that protect me. 
The repugnance, the
retching that thrusts me to the side 
and turns me away from
defilement, sewage, and muck. The shame 
of compromise, of
being in the middle of treachery. The 
fascinated start that leads
me toward and separates me from them.
Food loathing is perhaps the most 
elementary and most archaic form of 
abjection. When the eyes see or the 
lips touch
that skin on the surface of 
milk—harmless, thin as a sheet of
cigarette paper, pitiful as a nail 
paring—I experience a gagging

APPROACHING ABJECTION

sensation and, still farther down, 
spasms in the stomach, the
belly; and all the organs shrivel up 
the body, provoke tears and
bile, increase heartbeat, cause 
forehead and hands to perspire.
Along with sight-clouding dizziness, 
nausea makes me balk at
that milk cream, separates me from the 
mother and father who
proffer it. "I" want none of that 
element, sign of their desire;
"I" do not want to listen, "I" do not 
assimilate it, "I" expel
it. But since the food is not an 
"other" for "me," who am only
in their desire, I expel myself, I spit 
myself out, I abject myself
within the same motion through which 
"I" claim to establish
myself. That detail, perhaps an 
insignificant one, but one that
they ferret out, emphasize, evaluate, 
that trifle turns me inside
out, guts sprawling; it is thus that 
they see that "I" am in the
process of becoming an other at the 
expense of my own death,
During that course in which "I" become, 
I give birth to myself
amid the violence of sobs, of vomit. 
Mute protest of the symptom, shattering 
violence of a convulsion that, to be 
sure, is
inscribed in a symbolic system, but in 
which, without either
wanting or being able to become 
integrated in order to answer
to it, it reacts, it abreacts. It 
abjects.
The corpse (or cadaver: cadere, to 
fall), that which has irremediably come 
a cropper, is cesspool, and death; it 
upsets even
more violently the one who confronts it 
as fragile and fallacious
chance. A wound with blood and pus, or 
the sickly, acrid smell
of sweat, of decay, does not signify 
death. In the presence of
signified death—a flat encephalograph, 
for instance—I would
understand, react, or accept. No, as in 
true theater, without
makeup or masks, refuse and corpses 
show me what I permanently thrust aside 
in order to live. These body fluids, 
this
defilement, this shit are what life 
withstands, hardly and with
difficulty, on the part of death. 
There, I am at the border of
my condition as a living being. My body 
extricates itself, as
being alive, from that border. Such 
wastes drop so that I might
live, until, from loss to loss, nothing 
remains in me and my
entire body falls beyond the 
limit—cadere, cadaver. If dung
signifies the other side of the border, 
the place where I am not
and which permits me to be, the corpse, 
the most sickening of
wastes, is a border that has encroached 
upon everything. It is

3

4

APPROACHING ABJECTION

no longer I who expel, "I" is expelled. 
The border has become
an object. How can I be without border? 
That elsewhere that
I imagine beyond the present, or that I 
hallucinate so that I
might, in a present time, speak to you, 
conceive of you—it is
now here, jetted, abjected, into "my" 
world. Deprived of
world, therefore, I fall in a faint. In 
that compelling, raw, insolent thing in 
the morgue's full sunlight, in that 
thing that no
longer matches and therefore no longer 
signifies anything, I
behold the breaking down of a world 
that has erased its borders:
fainting away. The corpse, seen without 
God and outside of
science, is the utmost of abjection. It 
is death infecting life.
Abject. It is something rejected from 
which one does not part,
from which one does not protect oneself 
as from an object.
Imaginary uncanniness and real threat, 
it beckons to us and
ends up engulfing us.
It is thus not lack of cleanliness or 
health that causes abjection
but what disturbs identity, system, 
order. What does not respect
borders, positions, rules. The 
in-between, the ambiguous, the
composite. The traitor, the liar, the 
criminal with a good conscience, the 
shameless rapist, the killer who claims 
he is a
savior. . . . Any crime, because it 
draws attention to the fragility of the 
law, is abject, but premeditated crime, 
cunning murder, hypocritical revenge 
are even more so because they
heighten the display of such fragility. 
He who denies morality
is not abject; there can be grandeur in 
amorality and even in
crime that flaunts its disrespect for 
the law—rebellious, liberating, and 
suicidal crime. Abjection, on the other 
hand, is immoral, sinister, scheming, 
and shady: a terror that dissembles,*
a hatred that smiles, a passion that 
uses the body for barter
instead of inflaming it, a debtor who 
sells you up, a friend who
stabs you.*. . .
In the dark halls of the museum that is 
now what remains
of Auschwitz, I see a heap of 
children's shoes, or something
like that, something I have already 
seen elsewhere, under a
Christmas tree, for instance, dolls I 
believe. The abjection of
Nazi crime reaches its apex when death, 
which, in any case,
kills me, interferes with what, in my 
living universe, is supposed to save me 
from death: childhood, science, among 
other
things.

APPROACHING ABJECTION

THE ABJECTION OF SELF
If it be true that the abject 
simultaneously beseeches and pulverizes 
the subject, one can understand that it 
is experienced
at the peak of its strength when that 
subject, weary of fruitless
attempts to identify with something on 
the outside, finds the
impossible within; when it finds that 
the impossible constitutes
its very being, that it is none other 
than abject. The abjection
of self would be the culminating form 
of that experience of the
subject to which it is revealed that 
all its objects are based merely
on the inaugural loss that laid the 
foundations of its own being.
There is nothing like the abjection of 
self to show that all abjection is in 
fact recognition of the want on which 
any being,
meaning, language, or desire is 
founded. One always passes too
quickly over this word, "want," and 
today psychoanalysts are
finally taking into account only its 
more or less fetishized product, the 
"object of want." But if one imagines 
(and imagine
one must, for it is the working of 
imagination whose foundations are being 
laid here) the experience of want 
itself_as logically preliminary to 
being and object—to the being of the
object—then one understands that 
abjection, and even more so
abjection of self, is its only 
signified. Its signifier, then, is none
but literature. Mystical Christendom 
turned this abjection of
self into the ultimate proof of 
humility before God, witness
Elizabeth of Hungary who "though a 
great princess, delighted
in nothing so much as in abasing 
herself."1
The question remains as to the ordeal, 
a secular one this time,
that abjection can constitute for 
someone who, in what is
termed knowledge of castration, turning 
away from perverse
dodges, presents himself with his own 
body and ego as the
most precious non-objects; they are no 
longer seen in their own
right but forfeited, abject. The 
termination of analysis can lead
us there, as we shall see. Such are the 
pangs and delights of
masochism.
Essentially different from 
"uncanniness," more violent, too,
abjection is elaborated through a 
failure to recognize its kin;
nothing is familiar, not even the 
shadow of a memory. I imagine
a child who has swallowed up his 
parents too soon, who frightens himself 
on that account, "all by himself," and, 
to save

5

6

APPROACHING ABJECTION

himself, rejects and throws up 
everything that is given to him—
all gifts, all objects. He has, he 
could have, a sense of the abject.
Even before things for him are—hence 
before they are signifiable—he drives 
them out, dominated by drive as he is, 
and
constitutes his own territory, edged by 
the abject. A sacred
configuration. Fear cements his 
compound, conjoined to another world, 
thrown up, driven out, forfeited. What 
he has
swallowed up instead of maternal love 
is an emptiness, or rather
a maternal hatred without a word for 
the words of the father;
that is what he tries to cleanse 
himself of, tirelessly. What solace
does he come upon within such loathing? 
Perhaps a father,
existing but unsettled, loving but 
unsteady, merely an apparition but an 
apparition that remains. Without him 
the holy brat
would probably have no sense of the 
sacred; a blank subject,
he would remain, discomfited, at the 
dump for non-objects that
are always forfeited, from which, on 
the contrary, fortified by
abjection, he tries to extricate 
himself. For he is not mad, he
through whom the abject exists. Out of 
the daze that has petrified him before 
the untouchable, impossible, absent 
body of
the mother, a daze that has cut off his 
impulses from their
objects, that is, from their 
representations, out of such daze he
causes, along with loathing, one word 
to crop up—fear. The
phobic has no other object than the 
abject. But that word,
"fear"—a fluid haze, an elusive 
clamminess—no sooner has it
cropped up than it shades off like a 
mirage and permeates all
words of the language with 
nonexistence, with a hallucinatory,
ghostly glimmer. Thus, fear having been 
bracketed, discourse
will seem tenable only if it 
ceaselessly confront that otherness,
a burden both repellent and repelled, a 
deep well of memory
that is unapproachable and intimate: 
the abject.
BEYOND THE UNCONSCIOUS
Put another way, it means that there 
are lives not sustained by
desire, as desire is always for 
objects. Such lives are based on
exclusion. They are clearly 
distinguishable from those understood 
as neurotic or psychotic, articulated 
by negation and its
modalities, transgression, denial, and 
repudiation. Their dynamics

APPROACHING ABJECTION

challenges the theory of the 
unconscious, seeing that the latter
is dependent upon a dialectic of 
negativity.
The theory of the unconscious, as is 
well known, presupposes
a repression of contents (affects and 
presentations) that, thereby,
do not have access to consciousness but 
effect within the subject
modifications, either of speech 
(parapraxes, etc.), or of the body
(symptoms), or both (hallucinations, 
etc.). As correlative to the
notion of repression, Freud put forward 
that of denial as a means
of figuring out neurosis, that of 
rejection (repudiation) as a means
of situating psychosis. The asymmetry 
of the two repressions
becomes more marked owing to denial's 
bearing on the object
whereas repudiation affects desire 
itself (Lacan, in perfect keeping with 
Freud's thought, interprets that as 
"repudiation of the
Name of the Father").
Yet, facing the ab-ject and more 
specifically phobia and the
splitting of the ego (a point I shall 
return to), one might ask
if those articulations of negativity 
germane to the unconscious
(inherited by Freud from philosophy and 
psychology) have not
become inoperative. The "unconscious" 
contents remain here
excluded but in strange fashion: not 
radically enough to allow
for a secure differentiation between 
subject and object, and yet
clearly enough for a defensive position 
to be established—one
that implies a refusal but also a 
sublimating elaboration. As if
the fundamental opposition were between 
I and Other or, in
more archaic fashion, between Inside 
and Outside. As if such
an opposition subsumed the one between 
Conscious and Unconscious, elaborated 
on the basis of neuroses.
Owing to the ambiguous opposition 
I/Other, Inside/Outside—an opposition 
that is vigorous but pervious, violent 
but
uncertain—there are contents, 
"normally" unconscious in neurotics, 
that become explicit if not conscious 
in "borderline"
patients' speeches and behavior. Such 
contents are often openly
manifested through symbolic practices, 
without by the same
token being integrated into the judging 
consciousness of those
particular subjects. Since they make 
the conscious/unconscious
distinction irrelevant, borderline 
subjects and their speech constitute 
propitious ground for a sublimating 
discourse ("aesthetic" or "mystical," 
etc.), rather than a scientific or 
rationalist
one.

APPROACHING ABJECTION

AN EXILE WHO ASKS, "WHERE?"
The one by whom the abject exists is 
thus a deject who places
(himself), separates (himself), 
situates (himself), and therefore
strays instead of getting his bearings, 
desiring, belonging, or
refusing. Situationist in a sense, and 
not without laughter—
since laughing is a way of placing or 
displacing abjection. Necessarily 
dichotomous, somewhat Manichaean, he 
divides, excludes, and without, 
properly speaking, wishing to know his
abjections is not at all unaware of 
them. Often, moreover, he
includes himself among them, thus 
casting within himself the
scalpel that carries out his 
separations.
Instead of sounding himself as to his 
"being," he does so
concerning his place: "Where am I?" 
instead of "Who am I?" For
the space that engrosses the deject, 
the excluded, is never one,
nor homogeneous, nor totalizable, but 
essentially divisible, foldable, and 
catastrophic. A deviser of territories, 
languages,
works, the deject never stops 
demarcating his universe whose
fluid confines—for they are constituted 
of a non-object, the
abject—constantly question his solidity 
and impel him to start
afresh. A tireless builder, the deject 
is in short a stray. He is on
a journey, during the night, the end of 
which keeps receding.
He has a sense of the danger, of the 
loss that the pseudo-object!1
attracting him represents for him, but 
he cannot help taking the
risk at the very moment he sets himself 
apart. And the more
he strays, the more he is saved.
TIME: FORGETFULNESS AND THUNDER
For it is out of such straying on 
excluded ground that he draws
his jouissance. The abject from which 
he does not cease separating is for 
him, in short, a land of oblivion that 
is constantly
remembered. Once upon blotted-out time, 
the abject must have
been a magnetized pole of covetousness. 
But the ashes of oblivion now serve as 
a screen and reflect aversion, 
repugnance.
The clean and proper (in the sense of 
incorporated and incorporable) becomes 
filthy, the sought-after turns into the 
banished, fascination into shame. Then, 
forgotten time crops up
suddenly and condenses into a flash of 
lightning an operation

APPROACHING ABJECTION 9

that, if it were thought out, would 
involve bringing together
the two opposite terms but, on account 
of that flash, is discharged like 
thunder. The time of abjection is 
double: a time
of oblivion and thunder, of veiled 
infinity and the moment
when revelation bursts forth.
JOUISSANCE AND AFFECT
Jouissance, in short. For the stray 
considers himself as equivalent to a 
Third Party. He secures the latter's 
judgment, he acts
on the strength of its power in order 
to condemn, he grounds
himself on its law to tear the veil of 
oblivion but also to set up
its object as inoperative. As 
jettisoned. Parachuted by the Other.
A ternary structure, if you wish, held 
in keystone position by
the Other, but a "structure" that is 
skewed, a topology of
catastrophe. For, having provided 
itself with an alter ego, the
Other no longer has a grip on the three 
apices of the triangle
where subjective homogeneity resides; 
and so, it jettisons the
object into an abominable real, 
inaccessible except through
jouissancey It follows that jouissance 
alone causes the abject to
exist as such. One does not know it, 
one does not desire it,
one joys in it [on enjouit]. Violently 
and painfully. A passion.
And, as in jouissance where the object 
of desire, known as
object a [in Lacan's terminology], 
bursts with the shattered
mirror where the ego gives up its image 
in order to contemplate
itself in the Other, there is nothing 
either objective or objectal
to the abject. It is simply a frontier, 
a repulsive gift that the
Other, having become alter ego, drops 
so that "I" does not
disappear in it but finds, in that 
sublime alienation, a forfeited
existence. Hence a jouissance in which 
the subject is swallowed
up but in which the Other, in return, 
keeps the subject from
foundering by making it repugnant. One 
thus understands why
so many victims of the abject are its 
fascinated victims—if not
its submissive and willing ones.
We may call it a border; abjection is 
above all ambiguity.
Because, while releasing a hold, it 
does not radically cut off the
subject from what treatens it—on the 
contrary, abjection acknowledges it to 
be in perpetual danger. But also 
because ab-

10

APPROACHING ABJECTION

jection itself is a composite of 
judgment and affect, of condemnation 
and yearning, of signs and drives. 
Abjection preserves
what existed in the archaism of 
pre-objectal relationship, in the
immemorial violence with which a body 
becomes separated
from another body in order to 
be—maintaining that night in
which the outline of the signified 
thing vanishes and where only
the imponderable affect is carried out. 
To be sure, if I am
affected by what does not yet appear to 
me as a thing, it is
because laws, connections, and even 
structures of meaning govern and 
condition me. That order, that glance, 
that voice, that
gesture, which enact the law for my 
frightened body, constitute
and bring about an effect and not yet a 
sign. I speak to it in
vain in order to exclude it from what 
will no longer be, for
myself, a world that can be 
assimilated. Obviously, I am only
like someone else: mimetic logic of the 
advent of the ego, objects, and signs. 
But when I seek (myself), lose 
(myself), or
experience jouissance—then "I" is 
heterogeneous. Discomfort,
unease, dizziness stemming from an 
ambiguity that, through
the violence of a revolt against, 
demarcates a space out of which
signs and objects arise. Thus braided, 
woven, ambivalent, a
heterogeneous flux marks out a 
territory that I can call my own
because the Other, having dwelt in me 
as alter ego, points it out
to me through loathing.
This means once more that the 
heterogeneous flow, which
portions the abject and sends back 
abjection, already dwells in
a human animal that has been highly 
altered. I experience abjection only if 
an Other has settled in place and stead 
of what
will be "me." Not at all an other with 
whom I identify and
incorporate, but an Other who precedes 
and possesses me, and_
through such possession causes me to 
be. A possession previous
to my advent: a being-there of the 
symbolic that a father might
or might not embody. Significance is 
indeed inherent in the
human body.
AT THE LIMIT OF PRIMAL REPRESSION
If, on account of that Other, a space 
becomes demarcated,
separating the abject from what will be 
a subject and its objects,
it is because a repression that one 
might call "primal" has been

APPROACHING ABJECTION

11

effected prior to the springing forth 
of the ego, of its objects
and representations. The latter, in 
turn, as they depend on another 
repression, the "secondary" one, arrive 
only a posteriori
on an enigmatic foundation that has 
already been marked off;
its return, in a phobic, obsessional, 
psychotic guise, or more
generally and in more imaginary fashion 
in the shape of abjection,
notifies us of the limits of the human 
universe.
On such limits and at the limit one 
could say that there is no
unconscious, which is elaborated when 
representations and affects (whether or 
not tied to representations) shape a 
logic.
Here, on the contrary, consciousness 
has not assumed its rights
and transformed into signifiers those 
fluid demarcations of yet
unstable territories where an "I" that 
is taking shape is ceaselessly 
straying. We are no longer within the 
sphere of the unconscious but at the 
limit of primal repression that, 
nevertheless,
has discovered an intrinsically 
corporeal and already signifying
brand, symptom, and sign: repugnance, 
disgust, abjection.
There is an effervescence of object and 
sign—not of desire but
of intolerable significance; they 
tumble over into non-sense or
the impossible real, but they appear 
even so in spite of "myself'
(which is not) as abjection.
PREMISES OF THE SIGN, LININGS OF THE 
SUBLIME
Let us pause a while at this juncture. 
If the abject is already a
wellspring of sign for a non-object, on 
the edges of primal
repression, one can understand its 
skirting the somatic symptom
on the one hand and sublimation on the 
other. The symptom:
a language that gives up, a structure 
within the body, a nonassimilable 
alien, a monster, a tumor, a cancer 
that the listening
devices of the unconscious do not hear, 
for its strayed subject
is huddled outside the paths of desire. 
Sublimation, on the contrary, is 
nothing else than the possibility of 
naming the prenominal, the 
pre-objectal, which are in fact only a 
trans-nominal, a trans-objectal. In 
the~symptom, the abject permeates me,
I become abject. Through sublimation, I 
keep it under control.
The abject is edged with the sublime. 
It is not the same moment
on the journey, but the same subject 
and speech bring them
into being.

12

APPROACHING ABJECTION

For the sublime has no object either. 
When the starry sky,
a vista of open seas or a stained glass 
window shedding purple
beams fascinate me, there is a cluster 
of meaning, of colors, of
words, of caresses, there are light 
touches, scents, sighs, cadences that 
arise, shroud me, carry me away, and 
sweep me
beyond the things that I see, hear, or 
think. The "sublime"
object dissolves in the raptures of a 
bottomless memory. It is
such a memory, which, from stopping 
point to stopping point,
remembrance to remembrance, love to 
love, transfers that object to the 
refulgent point of the dazzlement in 
which I stray
in order to be. As soon as I perceive 
it, as soon as I name it,
the sublime triggers—it has always 
already triggered—a spree
of perceptions and words that expands 
memory boundlessly.
I then forget the point of departure 
and find myself removed
to a secondary universe, set off from 
the one where "I" am—
delight and loss. Not at all short of 
but always with and through
perception and words, the sublime is a 
something added that
expands us, overstrains us, and causes 
us to be both here, as
dejects, and there, as others and 
sparkling. A divergence, an
impossible bounding. Everything missed, 
joy—fascination.
BEFORE THE BEGINNING: SEPARATION
The abject might then appear as the 
most fragile (from a synchronic point 
of view), the most archaic (from a 
diachronic one)
sublimation of an "object" still 
inseparable from drives. The
abject is that pseudo-object that is 
made up before but appears
only within the gaps of secondary 
repression. The abject would
thus be the "object" of primal 
repression.
But what is primal repression? Let us 
call it the ability of the
speaking being, always already haunted 
by the Other, to divide,
reject, repeat. Without one division, 
one separation, one subject/
object having been constituted (not 
yet, or no longer yet). Why?
Perhaps because of maternal anguish, 
unable to be satiated
within the encompassing symbolic.
The abject confronts us, on the one 
hand, with those fragile
states where man strays on the 
territories of animal. Thus, by
way of abjection, primitive societies 
have marked out a precise

APPROACHING ABJECTION

13

area of their culture in order to 
remove it from the threatening
world of animals or animalism, which 
were imagined as representatives of sex 
and murder.
The abject confronts us, on the other 
hand, and this time
within our personal archeology, with 
our earliest attempts to
release the hold of maternal entity 
even before_ex-isting outside
of her, thanks to the autonomy of 
language. It is a violent,
clumsy breaking away,"\with the 
constant risk of falling back
under the sway of a power as securing 
as it is stifling". The
difficulty a mother has in 
acknowledging (or being acknowledged 
by) the symbolic realm—in other words, 
the problem
she has with the phallus that her 
father or her husband stands
for—is not such as to help the future 
subject leave the natural
mansion. The child can serve its mother 
as token of her own
authentication; there is, however, 
hardly any reason for her to
serve as go-between for it to become 
autonomous and authentic
in its turn. In such close combat, the 
symbolic light that a third
party, eventually the father, can 
contribute helps the future
subject, the more so if it happens to 
be endowed with a robust
supply of drive energy, in pursuing a 
reluctant struggle against
what, having been the mother, will turn 
into an abject. Repelling, rejecting; 
repelling itself, rejecting itself. 
Ab-jecting.
In this struggle, which fashions the 
human being, the mimesis,
by means of which he becomes homologous 
to another in order
to become himself, is in short 
logically and chronologically
secondary. Even before being like, "I" 
am not but do separate,
reject, ab-ject. Abjection, with a 
meaning broadened to take in
subjective diachrony, is a precondition 
of narcissism. It is
coexistent
with it and causes it to be permanently 
brittle. The more or
less beautiful image in which I behold 
or recognize myself rests
upon an abjection that sunders it as 
soon as repression, the
constant watchman, is relaxed.
THE "CHORA," RECEPTACLE OF NARCISSISM
Let us enter, for a moment, into that 
Freudian aporia called
primal repression. Curious primacy, 
where what is repressed
cannot really be held down, and where 
what represses always

14

APPROACHING ABJECTION

already borrows its strength and 
authority from what is apparently very 
secondary: language. Let us therefore 
not speak
of primacy but of the instability of 
the symbolic function in its
most significant aspect—the prohibition 
placed on the maternal
body (as a defense against 
autoeroticism and incest taboo). Here,
drives hold sway and constitute a 
strange space that I shall
name, after Plato (Timeus, 48-53), a 
chora, a receptacle.
For the benefit of the ego or its 
detriment, drives, whether
life drives or death drives, serve to 
correlate that "not yet" ego
with an "object" in order to establish 
both of them. Such a
process, while dichotomous 
(inside/outside, ego/not ego) and
repetitive, has nevertheless something 
centripetal about it: it
aims to settle the ego as center of a 
solar system of objects. If,
by dint of coming back towards the 
center, the drive's motion
should eventually become centrifugal, 
hence fasten on the Other
and come into being as sign so as to 
produce meaning—that
is, literally speaking, exorbitant.
But from that moment on, while I 
recognize my image as
sign and change in order to signify, 
another economy is instituted. The sign 
represses the chora and its eternal 
return. Desire
alone will henceforth be witness to 
that "primal" pulsation. But
desire ex-patriates the ego toward an 
other subject and accepts
the exactness of the ego only as 
narcissistic. Narcissism then
appears as a regression to a position 
set back from the other,
a return to a self-contemplative, 
conservative, self-sufficient
haven. Actually, such narcissism never 
is the wrinkleless image
of the Greek youth in a quiet fountain. 
The conflicts of drives
muddle its bed, cloud its water, and 
bring forth everything
that, by not becoming integrated with a 
given system of signs,
is abjection for it.
Abjection is therefore a kind of 
narcissistic crisis: it is witness
to the ephemeral aspect of the state 
called "narcissism" with
reproachful jealousy, heaven knows why; 
what is more, abjection gives 
narcissism (the thing and the concept) 
its classification
as "seeming."
Nevertheless, it is enough that a 
prohibition, which can be
a superego, block the desire craving an 
other—or that this
other, as its role demands, not fulfill 
it—for desire and its sig-

APPROACHING ABJECTION

15 )

nifiers to turn back toward the "same," 
thus clouding the waters
of Narcissus. It is precisely at the 
moment of narcissistic perturbation 
(all things considered, the permanent 
state of the
speaking being, if he would only hear 
himself speak) that secondary 
repression, with its reserve of 
symbolic means, attempts
to transfer to its own account, which 
has thus been overdrawn,
the resources of primal repression. The 
archaic economy is
brought into full light of day, 
signified, verbalized. Its strategies
(rejecting, separating, 
repeating/abjecting) hence find a 
symbolic existence, and the very logic 
of the symbolic—arguments,
demonstrations, proofs, etc.—must 
conform to it. It is then
that the object ceases to be 
circumscribed, reasoned with, thrust
aside: it appears as abject.
Two seemingly contradictory causes 
bring about the narcissistic crisis 
that provides, along with its truth, a 
view of the
abject. Too much strictness on the part 
of the Other, confused with
the One and the Law. The lapse of the 
Other, which shows
through the breakdown of objects of 
desire. In both instances,
the abject appears in order to uphold 
"I" within the Other. The
abject is the violence of mourning for 
an "object" that has
always already been lost. The abject 
shatters the wall of repression and its 
judgments. It takes the ego back to its 
source on
the abominable limits from which, in 
order to be, the ego has
broken away—it assigns it a source in 
the non-ego, drive, and
death. Abjection is a resurrection that 
has gone through death
(of the ego). It is an alchemy that 
transforms death drive into
a start of life, of new signifiance.
PERVERSE OR ARTISTIC
The abject is related to perversion^ 
The sense of abjection that
I experience is anchored in the 
superego. The abject is perverse
because it neither gives up nor assumes 
a prohibition, a rule,
or a law; but turns them aside, 
misleads, corrupts; uses them,
takes advantage of them, the better to 
deny them. It kills in the
name of life—a progressive despot; it 
lives at the behest of
death—an operator in genetic 
experimentations; it curbs the
other's suffering for its own profit—a 
cynic (and a psychoan-

16

APPROACHING ABJECTION

alyst); it establishes narcissistic 
power while pretending to reveal
the abyss—an artist who practices his 
art as a "business." Corruption is its 
most common, most obvious appearance. 
That
is the socialized appearance of the 
abject.
An unshakable adherence to Prohibition 
and Law is necessary
if that perverse interspace of 
abjection is to be hemmed in and
thrust aside. Religion, Morality, Law. 
Obviously always arbitrary, more or 
less; unfailingly oppressive, rather 
more than
less; laboriously prevailing, more and 
more so.
Contemporary literature does not take 
their place. Rather,
it seems to be written out of the 
untenable aspects of perverse
or superego positions. It acknowledges 
the impossibility of
Religion, Morality, and Law—their power 
play, their necessary
and absurd seeming. Like perversion, it 
takes advantage of
them, gets round them, and makes sport 
of them. Nevertheless,
it maintains a distance where the 
abject is concerned. The writer,
fascinated by the abject, imagines its 
logic, projects himself into
it, introjects it, and as a consequence 
perverts language—style
and content. But on the other hand, as 
the sense of abjection
is both the abject's judge and 
accomplice, this is also true of
the literature that confronts it. One 
might thus say that with
such a literature there takes place a 
crossing over of the dichotomous 
categories of Pure and Impure, 
Prohibition and Sin,
Morality and Immorality.
For the subject firmly settled in its 
superego, a writing of this
sort is necessarily implicated in the 
interspace that characterizes
perversion; and for that reason, it 
gives rises in turn to abjection.
And yet, such texts call for a 
softening of the superego. Writing
them implies an ability to imagine the 
abject, that is, to see
oneself in its place and to thrust it 
aside only by means of the
displacements of verbal play. It is 
only after his death, eventually, that 
the writer of abjection will escape his 
condition of
waste, reject, abject. Then, he will 
either sink into oblivion or
attain the rank of incommensurate 
ideal. Death would thus be
the chief curator of our imaginary 
museum; it would protect
us in the last resort from the 
abjection that contemporary literature 
claims to expend while uttering it. 
Such a protection,
which gives its quietus to abjection, 
but also perhaps to the

APPROACHING ABJECTION

bothersome, incandescent stake of the 
literary phenomenon itself, which, 
raised to the status of the sacred, is 
severed from
its specificity. Death thus keeps house 
in our contemporary
universe. By purifying (us from) 
literature, it establishes our
secular religion.
AS ABJECTION—SO THE SACRED
Abjection accompanies all religious 
structurings and reappears,
to be worked out in a new guise, at the 
time of their collapse.
Several structurations of abjection 
should be distinguished, each
one determining a specific form of the 
sacred.
Abjection appears as a rite of 
defilement and pollution in the
paganism that accompanies societies 
with a dominant or surviving 
matrilinear character. It takes on the 
form of the exclusion
of a substance (nutritive or linked to 
sexuality), the execution
of which coincides with the sacred 
since it sets it up.
Abjection persists as exclusion or 
taboo (dietary or other) in
monotheistic religions, Judaism in 
particular, but drifts over to
more "secondary" forms such as 
transgression (of the Law)
within the same monotheistic economy. 
It finally encounters,
with Christian sin, a dialectic 
elaboration, as it becomes integrated 
in the Christian Word as a threatening 
otherness—but
always nameable, always totalizeable.
The various means of purifying the 
abject—the various catharses—make up 
the history of religions, and end up 
with that
catharsis par excellence called art, 
both on the far and near side
of religion. Seen'from that standpoint, 
the artistic experience,
which is rooted in the abject it utters 
and by the same token
purifies, appears as the essential 
component of religiosity. That
is perhaps why it is destined to 
survive the collapse of the
historical forms of religions.
OUTSIDE OF THE SACRED, THE ABJECT IS 
WRITTEN
In the contemporary practice of the 
West and owing to the
crisis in Christianity, abjection 
elicits more archaic resonances
that are culturally prior to sin; 
through them it again assumes

17

18

APPROACHING ABJECTION

its biblical status, and beyond it that 
of defilement in primitive
societies. In a world in which the 
Other has collapsed, the
aesthetic task—a descent into the 
foundations of the symbolic
construct—amounts to retracing the 
fragile limits of the speaking
being, closest to its dawn, to the 
bottomless "primacy" constituted by 
primal repression. Through that 
experience, which
is nevertheless managed by the Other, 
"subject" and "object"
push each other away, confront each 
other, collapse, and start
again—inseparable, contaminated, 
condemned, at the boundary of what is 
assimilable, thinkable: abject. Great 
modern literature unfolds over that 
terrain: Dostoyevsky, Lautreamont,
Proust, Artaud, Kafka, Celine.
DOSTOYEVSKY
The abject is, for Dostoyevsky, the 
"object" of The Possessed:
it is the aim ,and motive of an 
existence whose meaning is lost
in absolute degradation because it 
absolutely rejected the moral
limit (a social, religious, familial, 
and individual one) as absolute—God. 
Abjection then wavers between the 
fading away of
all meaning and all humanity, burnt as 
by the flames of a conflagration, and 
the ecstasy of an ego that, having lost 
its Other
and its objects, reaches, at the 
precise moment of this suicide,
the height of harmony with the promised 
land. Equally abject
are Verkhovensky and Kirilov, murder 
and suicide.
A big fire at night always produces an 
exciting and exhilarating effect;
this explains the attraction of 
fireworks; but in the case of fireworks,
the graceful and regular shape of the 
flames and the complete immunity from 
danger produce a light and playful 
effect comparable to
the effect of a glass of champagne. A 
real fire is quite another matter:
there the horror and a certain sense of 
personal danger, combined with
the well-known exhilarating effect of a 
fire at night, produce in the
spectator (not, of course, in one whose 
house has burnt down) a
certain shock to the brain and, as it 
were, a challenge to his own
destructive instincts, which, alas, lie 
buried in the soul of even the
meekest and most domesticated official 
of the lowest grade. This grim
sensation is almost always delightful. 
"I really don't know if it is
possible to watch a fire without some 
enjoyment."2

APPROACHING ABJECTION

There are seconds—they come five or six 
at a time—when you suddenly feel the 
presence of eternal harmony in all its 
fullness. It is
nothing earthly. I don't mean that it 
is heavenly, but a man in his
earthly semblance can't endure it. He 
has to undergo a physical change
or die. This feeling is clear and 
unmistakable. It is as though you
suddenly apprehended all nature and 
suddenly said: "Yes, it is true—
it is good." [. . .] What is so 
terrifying about it is that it is so 
terribly
clear and such gladness. If it went on 
for more than five seconds, the
soul could not endure it and must 
perish. In those five seconds I live
through a lifetime, and I am ready to 
give my life for them, for it's
worth it. To be able to endure it for 
ten seconds, you would have to
undergo a physical change. I think man 
ought to stop begetting children. What 
do you want children for, what do you 
want mental
development, if your goal has been 
attained? It is said in the gospel
that in the resurrection they neither 
marry nor are given in marriage,
but are the angels of God in heaven. 
It's a hint. Is your wife giving
birth to a baby?3
Verkhovensky is abject because of his 
clammy, cunning appeal to ideals that 
no longer exist, from the moment when
Prohibition (call it God) is lacking. 
Stavrogin is perhaps less so,
for his immoralism admits of laughter 
and refusal, something
artistic, a cynical and gratuitous 
expenditure that obviously
becomes capitalized for the benefit of 
private narcissism but
does not serve an arbitrary, 
exterminating power. It is possible
to be cynical without being 
irremediably abject; abjection, on
the other hand, is always brought about 
by that which attempts
to get along with trampled-down law.
He's got everything perfect in his 
note-book, Verkhovensky went on.
Spying. Every member of the society 
spies on the others, and he is
obliged to inform against them. 
Everyone belongs to all the others,
and all belong to everyone. All are 
slaves and equals in slavery. In
extreme cases slander and murder, but, 
above all, equality. To begin
with, the level of education, science, 
and accomplishment is lowered.
A high level of scientific thought and 
accomplishment is open only
to men of the highest abilities! Men of 
the highest ability have always
seized the power and become autocrats. 
Such men cannot help being
autocrats, and they've always done more 
harm than good; they are
either banished or executed. A Cicero 
will have his tongue cut out,
Copernicus will have his eyes gouged 
out, a Shakespeare will be

19

20

APPROACHING ABJECTION

stoned—there you have Shigalyov's 
doctrine! Slaves must be equal:
without despotism there never has been 
any freedom or equality, but
in a herd there is bound to be 
equality—there's the Shigalyov doctrine
for you! Ha, ha, ha! You think it 
strange? I am for the Shigalyov
doctrine!4
Dostoyevsky has X-rayed sexual, moral, 
and religious abjection, displaying it 
as collapse of paternal laws. Is not the
world of The Possessed a world of 
fathers, who are either repudiated, 
bogus, or dead, where matriarchs 
lusting for power
hold sway—ferocious fetishes but 
nonetheless phantomlike?
And by symbolizing the abject, through 
a masterful delivery
of the jouissance produced by uttering 
it, Dostoyevsky delivered himself of 
that ruthless maternal burden.
But it is with Proust that we find the 
most immediately
erotic, sexual, and desiring mainspring 
of abjection; and it is
with Joyce that we shall discover that 
the feminine body, the
maternal body, in its most 
un-signifiable, un-symbolizable aspect, 
shores up, in'the individual, the 
fantasy of the loss in
which he is engulfed or becomes 
inebriated, for want of the
ability to name an object of desire.
PROUST
Abjection, recognized as inherent in 
the mellow and impossible alteration of 
the ego, hence recognized as welded to 
narcissism, has, in Proust, something 
domesticated about it; without 
belonging to the realm of "one's own 
clean and proper"
or of the "self evident," it 
constitutes a scandal of which one
has to acknowledge if not the banality 
at least the secrets of a
telltale snob. Abjection, with Proust, 
is fashionable, if not social; it is 
the foul lining of society. That may be 
why he furnishes
the only modern example, certified by 
dictionaries, of the use
of the word "abject" with the weak 
meaning it has (in French)
at the end of the eighteenth century:
In those regions that were almost 
slums, what a modest existence,
abject, if you please, but delightful, 
nourished by tranquillity and
happiness, he would have consented to 
lead indefinitely.5

APPROACHING ABJECTION

Proust writes that if the object of 
desire is real it can only
rest upon the abject, which is 
impossible to fulfill. The object
of love then becomes unmentionable, a 
double of the subject,
similar to it, but improper, because 
inseparable from an impossible 
identity. Loving desire is thus felt as 
an inner fold
within that impossible identity, as an 
accident of narcissism,
ob-ject, painful alteration, 
delightfully and dramatically condemned 
to find the other in the same sex only. 
As if one acceded
to the truth, to the abject truth of 
sexuality, only through 
homosexuality—Sodom and Gomorrah, the 
Cities of the Plain.
I had not even cause to regret my not 
having arrived in the shop until
several, minutes had elapsed. For from 
what I heard first at Jupien's
shop, which was only a series of 
inarticulate sounds, I imagine that
few words- had been exchanged. It is 
true that these sounds were so
violent that, if one set had not always 
been taken up an octave higher
by a parallel plaint, I might have 
thought that one person was strangling 
another within a few feet of me, and 
that subsequently the
murderer and his resuscitated victim 
were taking a bath to wash away
the traces of the crime. I concluded 
from this later on that there is
another thing as vociferous as pain, 
namely pleasure, especially when
there is added to it—failing the fear 
of an eventual parturition, which
could not be present in this case, 
despite the hardly convincing example
in the Golden Legend—an immediate 
afterthought of cleanliness.6
Compared to this one, the orgy in Sade, 
meshing with a
gigantic philosophy, be it that of the 
boudoir, had nothing
abject about it. Methodical, 
rhetorical, and, from that point of
view, regular, it broadens Meaning, 
Body, and Universe but
is not at all exorbitant: everything is 
nameable for it, the whole
is nameable. Sade's scene integrates: 
it allows for no other, no
unthinkable, nothing heterogeneous. 
Rational and optimistic,
it does not exclude. That means that it 
does not recognize a
sacred, and in that sense it is the 
anthropological and rhetorical
acme of atheism. Proustian writing, to 
the contrary, never gives
up a judging prerogative, perhaps a 
biblical one, which splits,
banishes, shares out, or condemns; land 
it is in relation to it,
with it and against it, that the web of 
Proust's sentence, memory, sexuality, 
and morality is elaborated—infinitely 
spinning
together differences (sexes, classes, 
races) into a homogeneity

21

22

APPROACHING ABJECTION

that consists only in signs, a fragile 
net stretched out over an
abyss of incompatibilities, rejections, 
and abjections. Desire and
signs, with Proust, weave the infinite 
cloth that does not hide
but causes the subdued foulness to 
appear. As lapse, discomfort,
shame, or blunder. As permanent threat, 
in short, to the homogenizing rhetoric 
that the writer composes against and 
with
the abject.
JOYCE
How dazzling, unending, eternal—and so 
weak, so insignificant, so sickly—is 
the rhetoric of Joycean language. Far 
from
preserving us from the abject, Joyce 
causes it to break out in
what he sees as prototype of literary 
utterance: Molly's monologue. If that 
monologue spreads out the abject, it is 
not because there is a woman speaking. 
But because, from ajar, the
writer approaches the hysterical body 
so that it might speak,
so that he might speak, using it as 
springboard, of what eludes
speech and turns out to be the hand to 
hand struggle of one
woman with another, her mother of 
course, the absolute because primeval 
seat of the impossible—of the excluded, 
the
outside-of-meaning, the abject. Atopia.

The abject here does not reside in the 
thematic of masculine
sexuality as Molly might see it. Not 
even in the fascinated
horror that the other women, sketched 
out in back of the men,
imbue the speaker with. The abject 
lies, beyond the themes,
and for Joyce generally, in the way one 
speaks; it is verbal
communication, it is the Word that 
discloses the abject. But at
the same time, the Word alone purifies 
from the abject, and
that is what Joyce seems to say when he 
gives back to the
masterly rhetoric that his Work in 
progress constitutes full powers
against abjection. A single catharsis: 
the rhetoric of the pure
signifier, of music in 
letters—Finnegans Wake.
Celine's journey, to the end of his 
night, will also encounter
rhythm and music as being the only way 
out, the ultimate
sublimation of the unsignifiable. 
Contrary to Joyce, however,
Celine will not find salvation in it. 
Again carrying out a rejection, without 
redemption, himself forefeited, Celine 
will become, body and tongue, the 
apogee of that moral, political,
and stylistic revulsion that brands our 
tide. A .time that seems
to have, for a century now, gone into 
unending labor pains.
The enchantment will have to wait for 
some other time, always
and forever.
BORGES
According to Borges the "object" of 
literature is in any case
vertiginous and hallucinatory. It is 
the Aleph, which appears,
in its transfinite truth, at the time 
of a descent, worthy of
Mallarme's Igitur, into the cellar of 
the native house, condemned
to destruction—by definition. A 
literature that dares to relate
the dizzying pangs of such a descent is 
no more than mediocre
mockery of an archaic memory that 
language lays out as much
as it betrays it. The Aleph is 
exorbitant to the extent that, within
the narrative, nothing could tap its 
power other than the narration of 
infamy. That is, of rampancy, 
boundlessness, the unthinkable, the 
untenable, the unsymbolizable. But what 
is it?
Unless it be the untiring repetition of 
a drive, which, propelled
by an initial loss, does not cease 
wandering, unsated, deceived,
warped, until it finds its only stable 
object—death. Handling

24 APPROACHING ABJECTION

that repetition, staging it, 
cultivating it until it releases, beyond
its eternal return, its sublime destiny 
of being a struggle with
death—is it not that which 
characterizes writing? And yet, dealing 
with death in that manner, making sport 
of it, is that not
infamy itself? The literary narrative 
that utters the workings of
repetition must necessarily become, 
beyond fantastic tales, detective 
stories, and murder mysteries, a 
narrative of the infamous (A Universal 
History of Infamy). And the writer 
cannot but
recognize himself, derisive- and 
forfeited, in that abject character, 
Lazarus Morell, the frightful redeemer, 
who raises his
slaves from the dead only to have them 
die more fully, but not
until they have been circulated—and 
have brought in a return—
like currency. Does that mean that 
literary objects, our fictional
objects, like the slaves of Lazarus 
Morell, are merely ephemeral
resurrections of that elusive Aleph? 
Does this Aleph, this impossible 
"object," this impossible imagination, 
sustain the work
of writing, even though the latter is 
merely a temporary halt
in the Borgesian race toward death, 
which is contained in the
chasm of the maternal cave?
The stealing of horses in one state and 
selling them in another were
barely more than a digression in 
Morell's criminal career, but they
foreshadowed the method that now 
assures him his rightful place in
a Universal History of Infamy. This 
method is unique not only for
the popular circumstances that 
distinguished it but also for the 
sordidness it required, for its deadly 
manipulation of hope, and for its
step by step development, so like the 
hideous unfolding of a nightmare. [. .

Flashing rings on their fingers to 
inspire respect, they traveled up
and down the vast plantations of the 
South. They would pick out a
wretched black and offer him freedom. 
They would tell him that if
he ran away from his master and allowed 
them to sell him, he would
receive a portion of the money paid for 
him, and they would then
help him escape again, this second time 
sending him to a free state.
Money and freedom, the jingle of silver 
dollars together with his
liberty—what greater temptation could 
they offer him? The slave
became emboldened for his first escape.
The river provided the natural route. A 
canoe; the hold of a steamboat; a scow; 
a great raft as big as the sky, with a 
cabin at the point

APPROACHING ABJECTION

was feeling the movement and the safety 
of the unceasing river. The
black would be sold on some other 
plantation, then run away again
to the canebrakes or the morasses. 
There his terrible benefactors (about
whom he now began to have serious 
misgivings) cited obscure expenses and 
told him they had to sell him one final 
time. On his return,
they said, they would give him his part 
of both sales and his freedom.
The man let himself be sold, worked for 
a while, and on his final
escape defied the hounds and the whip. 
He then made his way back
bloodied, sweaty, desperate, and 
sleepy. [. . .]
The runaway expected his freedom. 
Lazarus Morell's shadowy
mulattoes would give out an order among 
themselves that was sometimes barely 
more than a nod of the head, and the 
slave would be
freed from sight, hearing, touch, day, 
infamy, time, his benefactors,
pity, the air, the hound packs, the 
world, hope, sweat, and himself.
A bullet, a knife, or a blow, and the 
Mississippi turtles and catfish
would receive the last evidence.
Just imagine that imaginary machine 
transformed into a social
institution—and what you get is the 
infamy of fascism.
ARTAUD
An "I" overcome by the corpse—such is 
often the abject in
Artaud's text. For it is death that 
most violently represents the
strange state in which a non-subject, a 
stray, having lost its
non-objects, imagines nothingness 
through the ordeal of abjection. The 
death that "I" am provokes horror, 
there is a
choking sensation that does not 
separate inside from outside
but draws them the one into the other, 
indefinitely. Artaud is
the inescapable witness of that 
torture—of that truth.
The dead little girl says, I am the one 
who guffaws in horror inside
the lungs of the live one. Get me out 
of there at once.9
Once dead, however, my corpse was 
thrown out on the dunghill, and
I remember having been macerated I 
don't know now many days or
how many hours while waiting to awaken. 
For I did not know at first
that I was dead: I had to make up my 
mind to understand that before
I could succeed in raising myself. A 
few friends, then, who had completely 
forsaken me at first, decided to come 
and embalm my corpse
and were joylessly surprised at seeing 
me again, alive.

25

26 APPROACHING ABJECTION

I have no business going to bed with 
you, things, for I stink more
than you do, god, and going to bed does 
not mean getting soiled but,
to the contrary, clearing myself, from 
you.11
At that level of downfall in subject 
and object, the abject is
the equivalent of death. And writing, 
which allows one to
recover, is equal to a resurrection. 
The writer, then, finds himself marked 
out for identification with Christ, if 
only in order
for him, too, to be rejected, ab-jected:
For, as ball-breaking as this may seem, 
I am that Artaud crucified on
Golgotha, not as christ but as Artaud, 
in other words as complete
atheist. I am that body persecuted by 
erotic golosity, the obscene
sexual erotic golosity of mankind, for 
which pain is a humus, the
liquid from a fertile mucus, a serum 
worth sipping by one who has
never on his own gained by being a man 
while knowing that he was
becoming one.12
These different literary texts name 
types of abjects that are
answerable to, this goes without 
saying, different psychic structures. 
The types of articulation (narrative 
and syntactic structures, prosodic 
processes, etc. in the different texts) 
also vary.
Thus the abject, depending on the 
writer, turns out to be named
differently when it is not merely 
suggested by linguistic modifications 
that are always somewhat elliptic. In 
the final part of
this essay I shall examine in detail a 
specific articulation of the
abject—that of Celine. Let me just say 
at this point, as an
introduction, that contemporary 
literature, in its multiple variants, 
and when it is written as the language, 
possible at last,
of that impossible constituted either 
by a-subjectivity or by
non-objectivity, propounds, as a matter 
of fact, a sublimation
of abjection. Thus it becomes a 
substitute for the role formerly
played by the sacred, at the limits of 
social and subjective identity. But we 
are dealing here with a sublimation 
without consecration. Forfeited.
CATHARSIS AND ANALYSIS
That abjection, which modernity has 
learned to repress, dodge,
or fake, appears fundamental once the 
analytic point of view

APPROACHING ABJECTION 27

is assumed. Lacan says so when he links 
that word to the saint1
liness of the analyst, a linkage in 
which the only aspect of humor
that remains is blackness.13
One must keep open the wound where he 
or she who enters
into the analytic adventure is 
located—a wound that the professional 
establishment, along with the cynicism 
of the times and
of institutions, will soon manage to 
close up. There is nothing
initiatory in that rite, if one 
understands by "initiation" the
accession to a purity that the posture 
of death guaranteed (as in
Plato's Phaedo) or the unadulterated 
treasure of the "pure signifier" (as is 
the gold of truth in The Republic, or 
the pure
separatism of the statesman in the 
Statesman). It is rather a
heterogeneous, corporeal, and verbal 
ordeal of fundamental incompleteness: a 
"gaping," "less One." For the 
unstabilized subject who comes out of 
that—like a crucified person opening up
the stigmata of its desiring body to a 
speech that structures only
on condition that it let go—any 
signifying or human phenomenon, insofar 
as it is, appears in its being as 
abjection. For what
impossible catharsis? Freud, early in 
his career, used the same
word to refer to a therapeutics, the 
rigor of which was to come
out later.
WITH PLATO AND ARISTOTLE
The analyst is thus and forever sent 
back to the question that
already haunted Plato when he wanted to 
take over where
Apollonian or Dionysiac religion left 
off.14 Purification is something only 
the Logos is capable of. But is that to 
be done in the
manner of the Phaedo, stoically 
separating oneself from a body
whose substance and passions are 
sources of impurity? Or
rather, as in the Sophist, after having 
sorted out the worst from
the best; or after the fashion of the 
Philebus by leaving the doors
wide open to impurity, provided the 
eyes of the mind remain
focused on truth? In such a case, 
pleasure, having become pure
and true through the harmony of color 
and form as in the case
of accurate and beautiful geometric 
form, has nothing in common, as the 
philosopher says, with "the pleasures 
of scratching"
(Philebus 51).

APPROACHING ABJECTION

Catharsis seems to be a concern that is 
intrinsic to philosophy,
insofar as the latter is an ethics and 
unable to forget Plato. Even
if the mixture seems inevitable towards 
the end of the Platonic
course, it is the mind alone, as 
harmonious wisdom, that insures
purity: catharsis has been transformed, 
where transcendental
idealism is concerned, into philosophy. 
Of the cathartic incantation peculiar 
to mysteries, Plato has kept only, as 
we all know,
the very uncertain role of poets whose 
frenzy would be useful
to the state only after having been 
evaluated, sorted out, and
purified in its turn by wise men.
Aristotelian catharsis is closer to 
sacred incantation. It is the
one that has bequeathed its name to the 
common, esthetic concept of catharsis. 
Through the mimesis of passions—ranging
from enthusiasm to suffering—in 
"language with pleasurable
accessories," the most important of 
which being rhythm and
song (see the Poetics), the soul 
reaches orgy and purity at the same
time. What is involved is a 
purification of body and soul by
means of a heterogeneous and complex 
circuit, going from
"bile" to "fire," from "manly warmth" 
to the "enthusiasm"
of the "mind." Rhythm and song hence 
arouse the impure, the
other of mind, the 
passionate-corporeal-sexual-virile, but 
they
harmonize it, arrange it differently 
than the wise man's knowledge does. 
They thus soothe frenzied outbursts 
(Plato, in the
Laws, allowed such use of rhythm and 
meter only to the mother
rocking her child), by contributing an 
external rule, a poetic
one, which fills the gap, inherited 
from Plato, between body
and soul. To Platonic death, which 
owned, so to speak, the state
of purity, Aristotle opposed the act of 
poetic purification—in
itself an impure process that protects 
from the abject only by.
dint of being immersed in it. The 
abject, mimed through sound
and meaning, is repeated. Getting rid 
of it is out of the question—
the final Platonic lesson has been 
understood, one does not get
rid of the impure; one can, however, 
bring it into being a second
time, and differently from the original 
impurity. It is a repetition
through rhythm and song, therefore 
through what is not yet,
or no longer is "meaning," but 
arranges, defers, differentiates
and organizes, harmonizes pathos, bile, 
warmth, and enthusiasm. Benveniste 
translates "rhythm" by "trace" and 
"conca-

tenation" [enchainement]. Prometheus is 
"rhythmical," and we
call him "bound" [enchaine]. An 
attachment on the near and far
side of language. Aristotle seems to 
say that there is a discourse
of sex and that is not the discourse of 
knowledge—it is the only
possible catharsis. That discourse is 
audible, and through the
speech that it mimics it repeats on 
another register what the
latter does not say.
PHILOSOPHICAL SADNESS AND THE SPOKEN 
DISASTER
OF THE ANALYST
Poetic catharsis, which for more than 
two thousand years behaved as an 
underage sister of philosophy, face to 
face and
incompatible with it, takes us away 
from purity, hence from
Kantian ethics, which has long governed 
modern codes and
remains more faithful to a certain 
Platonic stoicism. By means
of the "universalizing of maxims," as 
is well known, the Kant
of the Foundations of the Metaphysics 
of Ethics or of the Metaphysical 
Principles of Virtue advocated an 
"ethical gymnastics"
in order to give us, by means of 
consciousness, control over
our defilements and, through that very 
consciousness, making
us free and joyous.
More skeptical and, from a certain 
point of view, more Aristotelian, 
Hegel, on the contrary, rejects a 
"calculation" that
claims to eliminate defilement, for the 
latter seems fundamental
to him. Probably echoing the Greek 
polis, he conceives of no
other ethics than that of the act. Also 
distrustful, however, of
those fine aestheticizing souls who 
find purity in the elaboration
of empty forms, he obviously does not 
hold to the mimetic and
orgiastic catharsis of Aristotle. It is 
in the historical act that Hegel
sees fundamental impurity being 
expended; as a matter of fact,
the latter is a sexual impurity whose 
historical achievement
consists in marriage. But—and this is 
where transcendental
idealism, too, sadly comes to an 
end—here it is that desire
{Lust), thus normalized in order to 
escape abject concupiscence
(Begierde), sinks into a banality that 
is sadness and silence. How
come? Hegel does not condemn impurity 
because it is exterior
to ideal consciousness; more 
profoundly—but also more craf-

30 APPROACHING ABJECTION

tily—he thinks that it can and should 
get rid of itself through
the historico-social act, If he thereby 
differs from Kant, he
nevertheless shares his condemnation of 
(sexual) impurity. He
agrees with his aim to keep 
consciousness apart from defilement, 
which, nevertheless, dialectically 
constitutes it. Reabsorbed into the 
trajectory of the Idea, what can 
defilement become if not the negative 
side of consciousness—that is, lack of
communication and speech? In other 
words, defilement as reabsorbed in 
marriage becomes sadness. In so doing, 
it has not
strayed too far from its logic, 
according to which it is a border
of discourse—a silence.15
It is obvious that the analyst, from 
the abyss of his silence,
brushes against the ghost of the 
sadness Hegel saw in sexual
normalization. Such sadness is the more 
obvious to him as his
ethics is rigorous—founded, as it must 
be in the West, on the
remains of transcendental idealism. But 
one can also argue that
the Freudian stance, which is dualistic 
and dissolving, unsettles
those foundations. In that sense, it 
causes the sad, analytic silence to 
hover above a strange, foreign 
discourse, which, strictly
speaking, shatters verbal communication 
(made up of a knowledge and a truth 
that are nevertheless heard) by means 
of a
device that mimics terror, enthusiasm, 
or orgy, and is more
closely related to rhythm and song than 
it is to the World.
There is mimesis (some say 
identification) in the analytic passage
through castration. And yet it is 
necessary that the analyst's
interpretative speech (and not only his 
literary or theoretical
bilingualism) be affected by it in 
order to be analytical. As
counterpoise to a purity that found its 
bearings in disillusioned
sadness, it is the "poetic" 
unsettlement of analytic utterance
that testifies to its closeness to, 
cohabitation with, and "knowledge" of 
abjection.
I am thinking, in short, of the 
completely mimetic identification 
(transference and countertransference) 
of the analyst with
respect to analysands. That 
identification allows for securing
in their place what, when parcelled 
out, makes them suffering
and barren. It allows one to regress 
back to the affects that can
be heard in the breaks in discourse, to 
provide rhythm, too,
to concatenate (is that what "to become 
conscious" means?) the

APPROACHING ABJECTION 31

gaps of a speech saddened because it 
turned its back on its abject
meaning. If there is analytic 
jouissance it is there, in the 
thoroughly poetic mimesis that runs 
through the architecture of
speech and extends from coenesthetic 
image to logical and phantasmatic 
articulations. Without for that matter 
biologizing language, and while 
breaking away from identification by 
means
of interpretation, analytic speech is 
one that becomes "incarnate" in the 
full sense of the term. On that 
condition only, it
is "cathartic"—meaning thereby that it 
is the equivalent, for
the analyst as well as for the 
analysand, not of purification but
of rebirth with and against abjection.
This preliminary survey of abjection, 
phenomenological on
the whole, will now lead me to a more 
straightforward consideration of 
analytic theory on the one hand, of the 
history of
religions on the other, and finally of 
contemporary literary
experience.

THE OBJECT AS TRIMMING OF ANGUISH
When psychoanalysts speak of an object 
they speak of the object
of desire as it is elaborated within 
the Oedipian triangle. According to 
that trope, the father is the mainstay 
of the law and
the mother the prototype of the object. 
Toward the mother
there is convergence not only of 
survival needs but of the first
mimetic yearnings. She is the other 
subject, an object that guarantees my 
being as subject. The mother is my 
first objectboth desiring and 
signifiable.
No sooner sketched out, such a, thesis 
is exploded by its
contradictions and flimsiness.
Do we not find, sooner (chronologically 
and logically speaking), if not objects 
at least pre-objects, poles of 
attraction of a
demand for air, food, and motion? Do we 
not also find, in the
very process that constitutes the 
mother as other, a series of
semi-objects that stake out the 
transition from a state of 
indifferentiation to one of discretion 
(subject/object)—semi-objects
that are called precisely 
"transitional" by Winnicott?1 Finally,
do we not find a whole gradation within 
modalities of separation: a real 
deprivation of the breast, an imaginary 
frustration
of the gift as maternal relation, and, 
to conclude, a symbolic

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

castration inscribed in the Oedipus 
complex; a gradation constituting, in 
Lacan's brilliant formulation, the 
object relation
insofar as it is always "a means of 
masking, of parrying the
fundamental fund of anguish" (Seminar 
of 1956-1957)?
The matter of the object sets in 
motion, or implicates, the
entire Freudian structure. 
Narcissism—beginning with what, or
when, does it allow itself to be 
exceeded by sexual drive, which
is drive toward the other? 
Repression—what type of repression
yields symbolization, hence a 
signifiable object, and what other
type, on the contrary, blocks the way 
toward symbolization
and topples drive into the 
lack-of-object of asymbolia or the
auto-object of somatization? The 
connection between the unconscious and 
language—what is the share of language 
learning
or language activity in the 
constitution of object relation and
its transformations?
It is with respect to the phobia of 
Little Hans that Freud
tackles in the clearest fashion the 
matter of the relation to the
object, which is crucial for the 
constitution of the subject.2
From the start, fear and object are 
linked. Can that be by accident? The 
unending and uncertain identifications 
of hysterics
did surely not throw light on Freud's 
work on this topic. This
obsessional rumination—which 
ceaselessly elaborates signs so as
better to protect, within the family 
vault, a sacred object that
is missing—was probably of greater 
avail to him in dealing
with the question. But why is it phobia 
that best allows one
to tackle the matter of relation to the 
object? Why fear and
object?
Confronted with states of distress that 
are evoked for us by
the child who makes himself heard but 
is incapable of making
himself understood, we, adults, use the 
word "fear." Birth
trauma, according to Otto Rank, or the 
upsetting of the balance
of drive integration elaborated by the 
maternal receptacle
(Wilfred R. Bion) in the course of 
uterine life and by "good
mothering," are theoretical artifacts: 
they rationalize a "zero
state" of the subject, and also 
probably a zero state of theory
as confronted with what the child has 
not uttered. Fear, therefore, in a 
first sense, could be the upsetting of 
a bio-drive balance.
The constitution of object relation 
might then be a reiteration

34

of fear, alternating with optimal but 
precarious states of balance.
Fear and object proceed together until 
the one represses the
other. But in which one of us is that 
fully successful?
HANS IS AFRAID OF THE UNNAMABLE
And yet, the fear of which one can 
speak, the one therefore that
has a signifiable object, is a more 
belated and more logical
product that assumes all earlier alarms 
of archaic, non-representable fear. 
Spoken fear, hence subsequent to 
language and
necessarily caught in the Oedipus 
structure, is disclosed as the
fear of an unlikely object that turns 
out to be the substitute for
another. Another "object"? That is what 
Freud believes when
he hears the story of little Hans who 
is afraid of horses. He
detects the fear of castration—of his 
mother's "missing" sexual
organ, of the loss of his own, of the 
guilty desire to reduce the
father to the same unmanning or to the 
same death, and so
forth.
This is astonishingly true, and not 
quite so. What is striking
in the case of Hans, as little as he 
might be, what Freud does
not cease to be astonished by, is his 
stupendous verbal skill: he
assimilates and reproduces language 
with impressive eagerness
and talent. So eager is he to name 
everything that he runs into
the unnamable—street sounds, that 
ceaseless trade activity involving 
horses in front of the house, the 
intensity with which
his father, a recent convert to 
psychoanalysis, is interested in
his body, his love for small girls, the 
stories and fantasies that
he (the father) sexualizes to the 
utmost; the somewhat elusive,
somewhat frail presence of his mother. 
All of this, which has
already considerable sense for Hans 
without having found its
significance, is doubtless distributed, 
as Freud says, between narcissistic 
conversation drive and sexual drive. It 
all becomes necessarily crystallized in 
the epistemophilic experience of Hans
who wants to know himself and to know 
everything; to know,
in particular, what seems to be lacking 
in his mother or could
be lacking in himself.
More generally, however, the phobia of 
horses becomes a
hieroglyph that condenses all fears, 
from unnamable to namable.

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

From archaic fears to those that 
accompany language learning,
at the same time as familiarization 
with the body, the street,
animals, people. The statement, "to be 
afraid of horses," is a
hieroglyph having the logic of metaphor 
and hallucination. By
means of the signifier of the phobic 
object, the "horse," it calls
attention to a drive economy in want of 
an object—that conglomerate of fear, 
deprivation, and nameless frustration, 
which,
properly speaking, belongs to the 
unnamable. The phobic object shows up 
at the place of non-objectal states of 
drive3 and
assumes all the mishaps of drive as 
disappointed desires or as
desires diverted from their objects.
The metaphor that is taxed with 
representing want itself (and
not its consequences, such as 
transitional objects and their sequels, 
the "a" objects of the desiring quest) 
is constituted under
the influence of a symbolizing agency. 
That symbolic law is
not necessarily of the superego type, 
but it can also seep into
the ego and the ideal of the ego.
PHOBIA AS ABORTIVE METAPHOR OF WANT
Metaphor of want as such, phobia bears 
the marks of the frailty
of the subject's signifying system. It 
must be perceived that
such a metaphor is inscribed not in 
verbal rhetoric but in the
heterogeneity of the psychic system 
that is made up of drive
presentations and thing presentations 
linked to word presentations. The 
infancy of little Hans does not 
entirely explain the
frailty of the signifying system that 
forces metaphor to turn
into drive and conversely. One must 
also conclude, and phobic
adults confirm this, that within the 
symbolic law accruing to
the function of the father, something 
remains blurred in the
Oedipal triangle constituting the 
subject. Does Hans' father not
play a bit too much the role of the 
mother whom he thrusts
into the shadows? Does he not overly 
seek the surety of the
professor? If phobia is a metaphor that 
has mistaken its place,
forsaking language for drive and sight, 
it is because a father
does not hold his own, be he the father 
of the subject or the
father of its mother.
Freud understands this perfectly. After 
the first accounts by

35

36

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

Hans' father, he suggests to such a 
Hermes that he remember
himself to his son and try, if only by 
means of his mustache
and pince-nez, to take the horses' 
place.
The treatment obviously succeeded, up 
to a point at any rate,
for Hans plays along and ventures to 
produce other metaphors
of his fear of the unnamable in the 
framework of a rhetoric that
on occasion clears itself of drive or, 
better, hysterizes it. Fear,
as a matter of fact, retreats to the 
benefit of a loathing for raspberry 
syrup, the color of which alone evokes 
the edge of a gash.
But has phobia really disappeared? It 
does not seem to have.
For at least two reasons.
First, the Freudian treatment, by 
referring to the apices of
the family triangle what we have seen 
to be a fear of the unnamable—fear of 
want and of castration?—actually 
revives the
phobia. The treatment justifies the 
phobic child. Freud tells Hans
that he is right; you cannot not be 
afraid of castration, and upon
your fear I found the truth of theory. 
In so doing, he rationalizes
that fear and, even though such a 
rationalization is also, in effect,
and because of transference, an 
elaboration, it remains in part
an anticathexis of phobia. A certain 
handling of the analytic
cure runs the risk of being nothing 
else but a counter-phobic
treatment, if that cure remains at the 
level of fantasy and does
not enter, after having traversed the 
latter, into the more subtle
workings of the metaphoric elaboration 
constituted by the statement and the 
phobic "object," to the extent that 
this "object"
is the representative of drive and not 
of an already present
object. Indeed, as Freud is first to 
admit, the analytical apparatus
is no match for that phobic 
condensation, for it cannot open
it out:
In the process of the formation of a 
phobia from the unconscious
thoughts underlying it, condensation 
takes place; and for that reason
the course of the analysis can never 
follow that of the development
of the neurosis.4
Obviously such an acknowledgment does 
no more than establish the difference 
between the analytic process and the 
neurotic condensation process. But one 
could also understand it
as neglecting, through the linear, 
transferential approach of

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF 37

analysis (the more so as analysis is 
often undertaken on the level
of the imaginary and even of the 
superego), the processes of
condensation that oversee phobic work. 
In order to deal with
such processes, it would be necessary 
to revive the work of
introjection as well as to pay 
particular attention to displacements 
and condensations within the signifying 
chain.
On the other hand, taking that 
metaphoricalness into account
would amount to considering the phobic 
person as a subject
in want of metaphoricalness. Incapable 
of producing metaphors
by means of signs alone, he produces 
them in the very material
of drives—and it turns out that the 
only rhetoric of which he
is capable is that of affect, and it is 
projected, as often as not,
by means of images. It will then fall 
upon analysis to give back
a memory, hence a language, to the 
unnamable and namable
states of fear, while emphasizing the 
former, which make up
what is most unapproachable in the 
unconscious. It will also
fall upon it, within the same 
temporality and the same logic,
to make the analysand see the void upon 
which rests the play
with the signifier and primary 
processes. Such a void and the
arbitrariness of that play are the 
truest equivalents of fear. But
does it not amount to diverting the 
analytic process towards
literature, or even stylistics? Is this 
not asking the analyst to be
rhetorical, to "write" instead of 
"interpreting"? Does this not
also imply holding up a fetishist 
screen, that of the word, before
a dissolving fear?
The fetishist episode peculiar to the 
unfolding of phobia is
well known. It is perhaps unavoidable 
that, when a subject
confronts the factitiousness of object 
relation, when he stands
at the place of the want that founds 
it, the fetish becomes a life
preserver, temporary and slippery, but 
nonetheless indispensable. But is not 
exactly language our ultimate and 
inseparable
fetish? And language, precisely, is 
based on fetishist denial
("I know that, but just the same," "the 
sign is not the thing,
but just the same," etc.) and defines 
us in our essence as speaking
beings. Because of its founding status, 
the fetishism of "language" is perhaps 
the only one that is unanalyzable.
One might then view writing, or art in 
general, not as the
only treatment but as the only 
"know-how" where phobia is

38

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

concerned. Little Hans has become stage 
director for an opera
house.
Finally, and this is the second reason 
why phobia does not
disappear but slides beneath language, 
the phobic object is a
proto-writing and, conversely, any 
practice of speech, inasmuch as it 
involves writing, is a language of 
fear. I mean a
language of want as such, the want that 
positions sign, subject,
and object. Not a language of the 
desiring exchange of messages
or objects that are transmitted in a 
social contract of communication and 
desire beyond want, but a language of 
want, of
the fear that edges up to it and runs 
along its edges. The one
who tries to utter this "not yet a 
place," this no-grounds, can
obviously only do so backwards, 
starting from an over-mastery
of the linguistic and rhetorical code. 
But in the last analysis he
refers to fear—a terrifying, abject 
referent. We encounter this
discourse in our dreams, or when death 
brushes us by, depriving
us of the assurance mechanical use of 
speech ordinarily gives
us, the assurance of being ourselves, 
that is, untouchable, unchangeable, 
immortal. But the writer is permanently 
confronted with such a language. The 
writer is a phobic who succeeds in 
metaphorizing in order to keep from 
being frightened
to death; instead he comes to life 
again in signs.
"I AM AFRAID OF BEING BITTEN" OR "I AM 
AFRAID
OF BITING"?
Nevertheless, does not fear hide an 
aggression, a violence that
returns to its source, its sign having 
been inverted? What was
there in the beginning: want, 
deprivation, original fear, or the
violence of rejection, aggressivity, 
the deadly death drive? Freud
abandoned the vicious circle of cause 
and effect, of the chicken
and the egg, by discovering a complex 
being completely alien
to the angelism of the Rousseauistic 
child. At the same time as
the Oedipus complex, he discovered 
infantile, perverse, polymorphic 
sexuality, always already a carrier of 
desire and death.
But, and this is the master stroke, he 
accompanied that "given"
with a completely symbolic causality 
that not only balances it
but destroys it as fundamental 
determinism. I refer to the mod-

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

eling and, in the final analysis, 
determining role of symbolic
language relation. From the deprivation 
felt by the child because
of the mother's absence to the paternal 
prohibitions that institute
symbolism, that relation accompanies, 
forms, and elaborates
the aggressivity of drives, which, 
consequently, never presents
itself in a "pure" state. Let me say 
then that want and aggressivity
are chronologically separable but 
logically coextensive. Aggressivity 
appears to us as a rejoinder to the 
original deprivation
felt from the time of the mirage known 
as "primary narcissism";
it merely takes revenge on initial 
frustrations. But what can be
known of their connection is that want 
and aggressivity are
adapted to one another. To speak of 
want alone is to repudiate
aggressivity in obsessional fashion; to 
speak of aggressivity
alone, forgetting want, amounts to 
making transference
paranoidal.
"I am afraid of horses, I am afraid of 
being bitten." Fear and
the aggressivity intended to protect me 
from some not yet
localizable cause are projected and 
come back to me from the
outside: "I am threatened." The fantasy 
of incorporation by
means of which I attempt to escape fear 
(I incorporate a portion
of my mother's body, her breast, and 
thus I hold on to her)
threatens me none the less, for a 
symbolic, paternal prohibition
already dwells in me on account of my 
learning to speak at the
same time. In the face of this second 
threat, a completely symbolic one, I 
attempt another procedure: I am not the 
one that
devours, I am being devoured by him; a 
third person therefore
(he, a third person) is devouring me.
PASSIVATION
Syntactical passivation, which heralds 
the subject's ability to
put himself in the place of the object, 
is a radical stage in the
constitution of subjectivity. What a 
fuss was made over "A
Child Is Being Beaten," what efforts 
exerted to write passive
sentences in those languages that have 
such a mood. I should
point out here that the logic of the 
constitution of the phobic
object also requires such a procedure 
of passivation. In parallel
fashion to the setting up of the 
signifying function, phobia,

39

40 SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

which also functions under the aegis of 
censorship and repression, displaces by 
inverting the sign (the active becomes 
passive)
before metaphorizing.
Only after such an inversion can the 
"horse" or the "dog"
become the metaphor of my empty and 
incorporating mouth,
which watches me, threatening, from the 
outside. Overdetermined like all 
metaphors, this "horse," this "dog" 
also contain
speed, racing, flight, motion, the 
street, traffic, cars, walking—
an entire world of others towards which 
they escape and where,
in order to save myself, I try to 
escape. But rendered culpable,
abashed, "I" come back, "I" withdraw, 
"I" meet with anguish
again: "I" am afraid.
Of what}
This sort of question appears only at 
that moment, laden
with all the meanings of object and 
pre-object relations, with
all its weight for a correlative "ego," 
and not as an empty sign.
This means that an object that is a 
hallucination is being made
up. The phobic object is a complex 
elaboration, already comprising logical 
and linguistic workings that are 
attempts at drive
introjection outlining the failure to 
introject that which is incorporated. 
If incorporation marks out the way 
toward the
constitution of the object, phobia 
represents the failure of the
concomitant drive introjection.
DEVOURING LANGUAGE
The phobia of a little girl, discussed 
during Anna Freud's seminar,5 gives us 
the opportunity to measure the 
importance of
orality in this matter. The fact that 
it is a girl who is afraid of
being eaten up by a dog is perhaps not 
without importance in
the emphasis on orality and 
passivation. Moreover, the phobia
followed upon a separation from her 
mother and a reunion
when the mother already belonged to 
another. Curiously, the
more phobic Sandy got, the more she 
spoke: the observer noted,
as a matter of fact, that she spoke 
with a rural accent, that she
was talkative, that at the age of three 
and a half "she talks a lot,
has an extensive vocabulary, expresses 
herself with ease and
enjoys repeating strange and difficult 
words."

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

Through the mouth that I fill with 
words instead of my
mother whom I miss from now on more 
than ever, I elaborate
that want, and the aggressivity that 
accompanies it, by saying.
It turns out that, under the 
circumstances, oral activity, which
produces the linguistic signifier, 
coincides with the theme of
devouring, which the "dog" metaphor has 
a first claim on. But
one is rightfully led to suppose that 
any verbalizing activity,
whether or not it names a phobic object 
related to orality, is
an attempt to introject the 
incorporated items. In that sense,
verbalization has always been 
confronted with the "ab-ject"
that the phobic object is. Language 
learning takes place as an
attempt to appropriate an oral "object" 
that slips away and
whose hallucination, necessarily 
deformed, threatens us from
the outside. Sandy's increasing 
interest in language, in proportion as 
her phobia grows, the verbal games in 
which she indulges, are on a par with 
the intense verbal activity of little
Hans, which I discussed.
One might contrast with this relation 
between phobia and
language in the child the commonplace 
observation on adult
phobic discourse. The speech of the 
phobic adult is also characterized by 
extreme nimbleness. But that 
vertiginous skill is
as if void of meaning, traveling at top 
speed over an untouched
and untouchable abyss, of which, on 
occasion, only the affect
shows up, giving not a sign but a 
signal. It happens because
language has then become a 
counterphobic object; it no longer
plays the role of an element of 
miscarried introjection, capable,
in the child's phobia, of revealing the 
anguish of original want.
In analyzing those structures one is 
led to thread one's way
through the meshes of the non-spoken in 
order to get at the
meaning of such a strongly barricaded 
discourse.
The child undergoing a phobic episode 
has not reached that
point. His symptom, because he utters 
it, is already an elaboration of 
phobia. By means of the logical and 
linguistic work
he undertakes at the same time, his 
symptom arrives at a complex and 
ambiguous elaboration. The phobic 
hallucination then
stands halfway between the recognition 
of desire and counterphobic 
construction: not yet a defensive, 
over-coded discourse
that knows too much and manipulates its 
objects wonderfully

41

42

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

well; nor is it a recognition of the 
object of want as object of
desire. The phobic object is precisely 
avoidance of choice, it
tries as long as possible to maintain 
the subject far from a
decision; this is not done through a 
superego blocking of symbolization or 
through asymbolia, but to the contrary 
through
a condensation of intense symbolic 
activities that results in the
heterogeneous agglomeration we call 
phobic hallucination.
HALLUCINATION OF NOTHING
It is, I said it earlier, a metaphor. 
And yet more than that. For
to the activity of condensation and 
displacement that oversees
its formation, there is added a drive 
dimension (heralded by fear)
that has an anaphoric, indexing value, 
pointing to something
else, to some non-thing, to something 
unknowable. The phobic
object is in that sense the 
hallucination of nothing: a metaphor 
that
is the anaphora of nothing.
What is "nothing"? The analyst wonders 
and answers, after
"deprivation," "frustration," "want," 
etc.: "the maternal phallus." That, 
from his point of view, is not false. 
But such a
position implies that, in order to 
bring fear to the surface, the
confrontation with the impossible 
object (the maternal phallus,
which is not) will be transformed into 
a fantasy of desire. On
the trail of my fear I meet again with 
my desire, and I bind
myself to it, thus leaving stranded the 
concatenation of discourse with which I 
have built my hallucination, my weakness
and my strength, my investment and my 
ruin.
It is precisely at such a point that 
writing takes over, within
the phobic child that we are, to the 
extent that we speak only
of anguish. It is not into a fantasy of 
desire that writing transforms the 
confrontation with the ab-ject. It 
unfolds, on the
contrary, the logical and psycho-drive 
strategies that make up
the hallucination metaphor improperly 
called "the object of
phobia." If we are all phobics in the 
sense that it is anguish that
causes us to speak, provided that 
someone forbids it, we are
not all scared of large horses or 
biting mouths. Hans has quite
simply written earlier than others, or 
rather he has been stage
director within a scription that 
encompassed his living space

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

with all its extras, putting into flesh 
(a horse) those logical
constructs that set us up as beings of 
abjection and/or as symbolic beings. He 
was a "writer," a precocious one, and 
also a
failure. The mature writer, whether a 
failure or not (though
perhaps never losing sight of those two 
alternatives), never
stops harking back to symbolization 
mechanisms, within language itself, in 
order to find in a process of eternal 
return, and
not in the object that it names or 
produces, the hollowing out
of anguish in the face of nothing./
PHOBIC NARCISSISM
Phobia literally stages the instability 
of object relation. The
lability of the "object" within the 
phobic "compromise"—
which may also be seen in some 
psychotic structures—can lead
us to consider the formation in 
question from the point of view
not of object relation but of its 
opposite correlative, narcissism.
There, too, we come up against 
difficulties of analytic theory
that are linked, this time, to its 
postulating a primary narcissism
following upon autoeroticism and to 
what amounts to a forcing
of thought—the assignment of a subject 
to archaic, pre-linguistic
narcissism, taking us back, in short, 
to the mother-child symbiosis. Freud 
accepted that difficulty: in 
postulating the existence of two kinds 
of drives, sexual drives directed toward
others and ego drives aimed at 
self-preservation, he appears to
have granted, in the phobic symptom, 
preponderance to the
latter.
But however clear may have been the 
victory in Hans's phobia of the
forces that were opposed to sexuality, 
nevertheless, since such an illness

is in its very nature a compromise, 
this cannot have been all that the
repressed drives obtained.6
Thus, even if sexual drives gain the 
upper hand again with
Hans, and this with the obsessed and 
obsessive help of the father
and the psychoanalyst, we are 
witnessing a victory of "the
forces that were opposed to sexuality." 
Such a narcissism presents us with at 
least two problems. How can one account 
for
its strength, which hands over the 
object drive? How does it
happen that, dominating as it may be, 
it does not lead to autism?

43

44

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

A particular biological makeup, 
imaginable although enigmatic, could 
provide a partial answer to the first 
question. And
yet it is the failure of the triangular 
relationship, which alone
posits the existence of an object, that 
seems to be implicated
here. In the final analysis, the 
so-called narcissistic drive dominates 
only if instability of the paternal 
metaphor prevents the
subject from finding its place within a 
triadic structure giving
an object to its drives. That means 
that the object relationship
of drives is a belated and even 
nonessential phenomenon. And
it is not by accident that Freud 
subordinates the question of the
drive object to the smoothing, if not 
the quenching, of the
drive.
The object of a drive is the thing in 
regard to which or through which
the drive is able to achieve its aim. 
It is what is most variable about
a drive and is not originally connected 
with it, but becomes assigned to
it only in consequence of being 
particularly fitted to make satisfaction
possible.7
This is easy enough to understand if 
one takes the word
object in its strongest acceptation—as 
the correlative of a subject
in a symbolic chain. The paternal 
agency alone, to the extent
that it introduces the symbolic 
dimension between "subject"
(child) and "object" (mother), can 
generate such a strict object
relation. Otherwise, what is called 
"narcissism," without always or 
necessarily being conservative, becomes 
the unleashing
of drive as such, without object, 
threatening all identity, including 
that of the subject itself. We are then 
in the presence
of psychosis.
THE "OBJECT" OF PHOBIC DESIRE: SIGNS
The point, however, of the 
hallucinatory metaphor of the phobic is 
precisely that, while displaying the 
victory of "the forces
that were opposed to sexuality, " it 
finds a certain "object."
Which one? Not the object of sexual 
drive; the mother, or her
parts, or her representatives; no more 
than some neutral referent
or other, but symbolic activity itself. 
If the latter is often eroticized,
and if the phobic, in that case, 
cumulates with the obsessive,

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF 45

this does not detract from the 
originality of the structure, which
consists in the following: symbolicity 
itself is cathected by a
drive that is not object-oriented in 
the classic sense of the term
(we are not dealing with an object of 
need or desire), nor is it
narcissistic (it does not return to 
collapse upon the subject or
to cause its collapse). Since it is not 
sex-oriented, it denies the
question of sexual difference; the 
subject that houses it can
produce homosexual symptoms while being 
strictly speaking
indifferent to them: that is not where 
the subject is. If it is true
that such/cathexis of symbolicity as 
sole site of drive and desire
is a means of preservation, it is 
obviously not the specular ego—
the reflection of the maternal 
phallus—that sees itself thus 
preserved; on the contrary, the ego, 
here, is rather in abeyance.
Strangely enough, however, it is the 
subject that is built up, to
the extent that it is the correlative 
of the paternal metaphor,
disregarding the failure of its 
support—the subject, that is, as
correlative of the Other.
A representative of the paternal 
function takes the place of
the good maternal object that is 
wanting. There is language
instead of the good breast. Discourse 
is being substituted for
maternal care, and with it a fatherhood 
belonging more to the
realm of the ideal than of the 
superego. One can vary the patterns 
within which such an ascendency of the 
Other, replacing
the object and taking over where 
narcissism left off, produces
a hallucinatory metaphor. There is fear 
and fascination. The
body (of the ego) and the (sexual) 
object are completely absorbed in it.
Abjection—at the crossroads of phobia, 
obsession, and perversion—shares in the 
same arrangement. The loathing that is
implied in it does not take on the 
aspect of hysteric conversion;
the latter is the symptom of an ego 
that, overtaxed by a "bad
object," turns away from it, cleanses 
itself of it, and vomits it.
In abjection, revolt is completely 
within being. Within the being
of language. Contrary to hysteria, 
which brings about, ignores,
or seduces the symbolic but does not 
produce it, the subject of
abjection is eminently productive of 
culture.. Its symptom is the
rejection and reconstruction of 
languages.,

AIMING AT THE APOCALYPSE: SIGHT
To speak of hallucination in connection 
with such an unstable
"object" suggests at once that there is 
a visual cathexis in the
phobic mirage—and at least a 
speculative cathexis in the abject.
Elusive, fleeting, and baffling as it 
is, that non-object can be
grasped only as a sign. It is through 
the intermediary of a
representation, hence a seeing, that it 
holds together. A visual
hallucination that, in the final 
analysis, gathers up the others
(those that are auditory, tactile, 
etc.) and, as it bursts into a
symbolicity that is normally calm and 
neutral, represents the
subject's desire. For the absent 
object, there is a sign. For the
desire of that want, there is a visual 
hallucination. More than
that, a cathexis of looking, in 
parallel with the symbolic domination 
taking the place of narcissism, often 
leads to voyeuristic
"side effects" of phobia. Voyeurism is 
a structural necessity in
the constitution of object relation, 
showing up every time the
object shifts towards the abject; it 
becomes true perversion only
if there is a failure to symbolize the 
subject/object instability.
Voyeurism accompanies the writing of 
abjection. When that
writing stops, voyeurism becomes a 
perversion.8
A FORTIFIED CASTLE
Whether it be projected metaphor or 
hallucination, the phobic
object has led us, on the one hand, to 
the borders of psychosis
and, on the other, to the strongly 
structuring power of symbolicity. In 
either case, we are confronted with a 
limit that turns
the speaking being into a separate 
being who utters only by
separating—from within the discreteness 
of the phonemic chain
up to and including logical and 
ideological constructs.
How does such a limit become 
established without changing
into a prison? If the radical effect of 
the founding division is
the establishment of the subject/object 
division, how can one
prevent its misfires from leading 
either to the secret confinement
of archaic narcissism, or to the 
indifferent scattering of objects
that are experienced as false? The 
glance cast on phobic symptom has 
allowed us to witness the painful 
dawning, splendid

in its symbolic complexity, of the 
(verbal) sign in the grip of
drive (fear, aggressivity) and sight 
(projection of the ego ontoI
the other). But analytic reality, 
mindful of what is called the
"unanalyzable," seems to cause 
experience to arise from another
symptom, one that emerges from the same 
very problematic
separation subject/object—but now 
seemingly at the opposite
end of phobic hallucination.
The constituting barrier between 
subject and object has here
become an unsurmountable wall. An ego, 
wounded to the point
of annulment, barricaded and 
untouchable, cowers somewhere,
nowhere, at no other place than the one 
that cannot be found. /
Where objects are concerned he 
delegates phantoms, ghosts,
"false cards": a stream of spurious 
egos and for that very reason
spurious objects, seeming egos that 
confront undesirable objects. 
Separation exists, and so does 
language, even brilliantly
at times, with apparently remarkable 
intellectual realizations.
But no current flows—it is a pure and 
simple splitting, an abyss
without any possible means of 
conveyance between its two
edges. No subject, no object: 
petrification on one side, falsehood on 
the other.
Letting current flow into such a 
"fortified castle" amounts
to causing desire to rise. But one soon 
realizes, during transference, that 
desire, if it dawns, is only a 
substitute for adaptation to a social 
norm (is desire ever anything else but 
desire
for an idealized norm, the norm of the 
Other?). On the way,
as if hatched by what, for others, will 
be desire, the patient
encounters abjection. It seems to be 
the first authentic feeling
of a subject in the process of 
constituting itself as such, as it
emerges out of its jail and goes to 
meet what will become, but
only later, objects. Abjection of self: 
the first approach to a self
that would otherwise be walled in. 
Abjection of others, of the
other ("I feel like vomiting the 
mother"), of the analyst, the
only violent link to the world. A rape 
of anality, a stifled aspiration 
towards an other as prohibited as it is 
desired—abject.
The outburst of abjection is doubtless 
only a moment in the
treatment of borderline cases. I call 
attention to it here because
of the key position it assumes in the 
dynamics of the subject's
constitution, which is nothing other 
than a slow, laborious

48

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

production of object relation. When the 
fortified castle of the
borderline patient begins to see its 
walls crumble, and its indifferent 
pseudo-objects start losing their 
obsessive mask, the
subject-effect—fleeting, fragile, but 
authentic—allows itself to
be heard in the advent of that 
interspace, which is abjection.
It is not within the scheme of the 
analytic setup, probably
because it does not have the power to 
do so, to linger over that
blossoming. Emphasizing it would lead 
the patient into paranoia or, at best, 
into morality; now, the psychoanalyst 
does not
believe he exists for that purpose. He 
follows or diverts the
path, leading the patient towards the 
"good" object—the object
of desire, which is, whatever may be 
said, fantasized according
to the normal criteria of the Oedipus 
complex: a desire for the
other sex.
That, however, is not where we stand 
with respect to abjection in the case 
of the borderline patient. It had 
barely begun
to slide the bolt of narcissism and had 
changed the walls behind
which he protected himself into a 
barely pervious limit—and
for that very reason, a threatening, 
abominable one. Hence
there was not yet an other, an ob-ject: 
merely an ab-ject. What
is to be done with this ab-ject? Allow 
it to drift towards the
libido so as to constitute an object of 
desire? Or towards symbolicity, to 
change it into a sign of love, hatred, 
enthusiasm,
or damnation? The question might well 
remain undecided,
undecidable.
It is within that undecidable space, 
logically coming before
the choice of the sexual object, that 
the religious answer to
abjection breaks in: defilement, taboo, 
or sin. In dealing with such
notions, rehabilitating them will not 
be the point. My aim will
be to bring to light the variants of 
the subject/object relation
that religions implied, avoiding the 
nonexistence of separation
just as much as the rigidity of the 
splitting. In other words, I
shall need to look into the solutions 
given for phobia and psychosis by 
religious codes.
POWERLESS OUTSIDE, IMPOSSIBLE INSIDE
Constructed on the one hand by the 
incestuous desire of (for)
his mother and on the other by an 
overly brutal separation from

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

49

her, the borderline patient, even 
though he may be a fortified
castle, is nevertheless an empty 
castle. The absence, or the failure, of 
paternal function to establish a 
unitary bent between
subject and object, produces this 
strange configuration: an encompassment 
that is stifling (the container 
compressing the ego)
and, at the same time, draining (the 
want of an other, qua
object, produces nullity in the place 
of the subject). The ego
then plunges into a pursuit of 
identifications that could repair
narcissism—identifications that the 
subject will experience as
in-significant, "empty," "null," 
"devitalized," "puppet-like."
An empty castle, haunted by unappealing 
ghosts—"powerless"
outside, "impossible" inside.
It is worth noting what repercussions 
such a foreclosure of
the Name of the Father have on 
language. That of the borderline
patient is often abstract, made up of 
stereotypes that are bound
to seem cultured; he aims at precision, 
indulges in self-examination, in 
meticulous comprehension, which easily 
brings to
mind obsessional discourse. But there 
is more to it than that.
That shell of ultra-protected signifier 
keeps breaking up to the
point of desemantization, to the point 
of reverberating only as
notes, music, "pure signifier" to be 
reparcelled out and resemanticized 
anew. It is a breaking up that puts a 
check on free
association and pulverizes fantasy 
before it can take shape. It
is, in short, a reduction of discourse 
to the state of "pure"
signifier, which insures the 
disconnection between verbal signs
on the one hand and drive 
representations on the other. And
it is precisely at such a boundary of 
language splitting that the
affect makes an imprint. Within the 
blanks that separate dislocated themes 
(like the limbs of a fragmented body), 
or through
the shimmering of a signifier that, 
terrified, flees its signified,
the analyst can perceive the imprint of 
that affect, participating"
in the language cluster that everyday 
usage of speech absorbs
but, with the borderline patient, 
becomes dissociated and collapses. The 
affect is first enunciated as a 
coenesthetic image of
painful fixation; the borderline 
patient speaks of a numbed
body, of hands that hurt, of paralyzed 
legs. But also, as a motion
metaphor binding significance: 
rotation, vertigo, or infinite
quest. The problem then, starting with 
transference, is to tap
these remainders of signifying 
vectorization (which the paternal

50

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

metaphor makes fast and stabilizes into 
"normal discourse" in
the case of the normative Oedipus 
triangle, which is here absent)
by giving them a desiring and/or 
deathly signification. In short,
one unfailingly orients them toward the 
other: another object,
perhaps another sex, and, why not, 
another discourse—a text,
a life to relive.
WHY DOES LANGUAGE APPEAR TO BE "ALIEN"?
Finally, foreclosure of paternal 
function affects what, in the
sign, stems from condensation (or 
metaphor), that is, the ability
of the sound-trace to maintain and go 
beyond (in the sense of
an Aujhebung) the signified, which 
always involves a relation
to the addressee as a perception, as 
well as coenesthetic representation of 
object relation and of the relation to 
the discourse of
the other subject. With the borderline 
patient there is a collapse
of the nexus constituted by the verbal 
signifier effecting the
simultaneous Aujhebung of both 
signified and affect. A consequence of 
that disconnection, involving the very 
function of
language in its psychic economy, is 
that verbalization, as he
says, is alien to him. More so than 
with the neurotic, it is by
means of the signifier alone that the 
unconscious meaning of
the borderline patient is delivered. 
Only seldom is metaphor
included in his speech; when it is, 
more than with anyone else,
it is a literal one—to be understood as 
metonymy for unnamable
desire. "I displace, therefore you must 
associate and condense
for me," says such an analysand, who, 
in short, is asking the
analyst to build up an imagination for 
him. He is asking to be
saved like Moses, to be born like 
Christ. He is asking for a
rebirth that—the analysand knows it, he 
tells it to us—will
result from a speech that is recovered, 
rediscovered as belonging
to him. Lacan had perceived this: the 
metaphor retraces within
the unconscious the path of paternal 
myth, and it is quite deliberately that 
Victor Hugo's metaphor in Booz endormi 
is chosen, in Ecrits, as illustration 
of all metaphoricity.9 But with the
borderline patient, sense does not 
emerge out of non-sense,
metaphorical or witty though it might 
be. On the contrary,
non-sense runs through signs and sense, 
and the resulting ma-

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

51

nipulation of words is not an 
intellectual play but, without any
laughter, a desperate attempt to hold 
on to the ultimate obstacles
of a pure signifier that has been 
abandoned by the paternal
metaphor. It is a frantic attempt made 
by a subject threatened
with sinking into the void. A void that 
is not nothing but
indicates, within its discourse, a 
challenge to symbolization.
Whether we call it an affect10 or link 
it with infantile semiotization—for 
which pre-signifying articulations are 
merely equations rather than symbolic 
equivalents for objects,11 we must
point to a necessity within analysis. 
This necessity, emphasized
by that type of structure, consists in 
not reducing analytic attention to 
language to that of philosophical 
idealism and, in its
wake, to linguistics; the point is, 
quite to the contrary, to posit
a heterogeneity of signifiance. It 
stands to reason that one can say
nothing of such (effective or semiotic) 
heterogeneity without
making it homologous with the 
linguistic signifier. But it is
precisely that powerlessness that the 
"empty" signifier, the dissociation of 
discourse, and the fully physical 
suffering of these
patients within the faults of the Word 
come to indicate.
THE "SIGN" ACCORDING TO FREUD
It is necessary, therefore, to go back 
to the Freudian theory of
language. And, returning to the moment 
when it starts off from
neurophysiology,12 one notes the 
heterogeneity of the Freudian
sign. This sign is articulated as 
establishing a relation between
word Presentation and object 
Presentation (which becomes
thing Presentation as early as 1915). 
The former is already a
closed heterogeneous set (sound image, 
reading image, written
image, spoken motor image), as is the 
latter, but this one is
open (acoustic image, tactile image, 
visual image). Obviously
privileged here, the sound image of 
word presentation and the
visual image of object presentation 
become linked, calling to
mind very precisely the matrix of the 
sign belonging to philosophical 
tradition and to which Saussurian 
semiology gave
new currency. But it is easy to forget 
the other elements belonging to the 
sets thus tied together. They are what 
constitutes
all the originality of Freudian 
"semiology" and guarantee its

52

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

hold on the heterogeneous economy (body 
and discourse) of
the speaking being (and particularly on 
the psychosomatic
"disturbances" of speech).
One might think that Freud's later 
concern with neurotic
discourse had centered his thought 
solely on the relation between sound 
image and visual image.13 But there are 
two things
that allow me to say that Freud's 
research constantly left open
the hypothetical suture of the "pure 
signifier" that an overly
philosophical reading, in a word a 
Kantian one, might compel;
these are, on the one hand, the 
discovery of the Oedipus complex and, 
on the other, that of the splitting of 
the Ego and the
second topography, together with, 
precisely, the very heterogeneous 
(involving both drive and thought) 
importance of the
symbol of negation.14 Although a 
reductiveness of this sort
amounts to a true castration of the 
Freudian discovery, one
should not forget the advantages that 
centering the heterogeneous Freudian 
sign in the Saussurian one afforded. 
Essentially,
they can be summed up in the explicit 
statement of a question
that has haunted Freud ever since the 
discovery of the Oedipus
complex.
THE SIGN—A CONDENSATION
What is it that insures the existence 
of the sign, that is, of the
relation that is a condensation between 
sound image (on the side
of word presentation) and visual image 
(on the side of thing
presentation)? Condensation is indeed 
what we are dealing with,
and the logic of dreams testifies to it 
when it brings together
elements from different perception 
registers or when it engages
in ellipses. The figure of speech known 
as metaphor merely
actuates, within the synchronic 
handling of discourse, the process 
that, genetically and diachronically, 
makes up one signifying
unit out of at least two (sound and 
sight) components. But the
speaking subject enjoys the possibility 
of condensation because
it is inscribed in the Oedipal 
triangle. By means of that inscription, 
not only beginning with the so-called 
Oedipal stage but
from the time of its advent into the 
world, which is always
already a world of discourse, it finds 
itself subjected to paternal

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

function. Thus, when Lacan posits the 
Name of the Father as
the keystone to all sign, meaning, and 
discourse, he points to
the necessary condition of one and only 
one process of the signifying unit, 
albeit a constitutive one: the process 
of condensing
one heterogeneous set (that of word 
presentation) with another
(that of thing presentation), releasing 
the one into the other,
and insuring its "unitary bent." Such a 
statement of the problem
enables one to avoid all the 
metaphysics, not to mention the
arbitrariness, that underlies, in the 
wake of John Stuart Mill,
to whom Freud alludes, the Freudian 
notions of "presentation."
The stress shifts from the terms 
(images) to the functions that
tie them together (condensation, 
metaphoricalness, and more
strongly yet, paternal function), and 
ultimately to the space,
the topology that emerges out of them 
(unitary bent).
Nevertheless, when the condensation 
function that constitutes the sign 
collapses (and in that case one always 
discovers
a collapse of the Oedipal triangulation 
that supports it), once
the sound image/sight image solidarity 
is undone, such a splitting allows one 
to detect an attempt at direct 
semantization of
acoustic, tactile, motor, visual, etc., 
coenesthesia. A language
now manifests itself whose complaint 
repudiates the common
code, then builds itself into an 
idiolect, and finally resolves itself
through the sudden irruption of affect.
THE HORROR WITHIN
The body's inside, in that case, shows 
up in order to compensate
for the collapse of the border between 
inside and outside. It is
as if the skin, a fragile container, no 
longer guaranteed the
integrity of one's "own and clean self" 
but, scraped or transparent, invisible 
or taut, gave way before the dejection 
of its
contents. Urine, blood, sperm, 
excrement then show up in
order to reassure a subject that is 
lacking its "own and clean
self." The abjection of those flows 
from within suddenly become the sole 
"object1' of sexual desire—a true 
"ab-ject" where
man, frightened, crosses over the 
horrors of maternal bowels
and, in an immersion that enables him 
to avoid coming face
to face with an other, spares 
himself-the risk of castration. But

53

54

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF

at the same time that immersion gives 
him the full power of
possessing, if not being, the bad 
object that inhabits the maternal
body. Abjection then takes the place of 
the other, to the extent
of affording him jouissance, often the 
only one for the borderline patient 
who, on that account, transforms the 
abject into
the site of the Other. 15Such a 
frontiersman is a metaphysician
who carries the experience of the 
impossible to the point of
scatology. When a woman ventures out in 
those regions it is
usually to gratify, in very maternal 
fashion, the desire for the
abject that insures the life (that is, 
the sexual life) of the man
whose symbolic authority she accepts. 
Very logically, this is
an abjection from which she is 
frequently absent; she does not
think about it, preoccupied as she is 
with settling accounts
(obviously anal) with her own mother. 
Rarely does a woman
tie her desire and her sexual life to 
that abjection, which, coming
to her from the other, anchors her 
interiorly in the Other. When
that happens, one notes that it is 
through the expedient of
writing that she gets there, and on 
that account she still has
quite a way to go within the Oedipal 
mosaic before identifying
with the owner of the penis.
CONFRONTING THE MATERNAL
But devotees of the abject, she as well 
as he, do not cease
looking, within what flows from the 
other's "innermost
being," for the desirable and 
terrifying, nourishing and murderous, 
fascinating and abject inside of the 
maternal body. For,
in the misfire of identification with 
the mother as well as with
the father, how else are they to be 
maintained in the Other?
How, if not by incorporating a 
devouring mother, for want
of having been able to introject her 
and joy in what manifests
her, for want of being able to signify 
her: urine, blood, sperm,
excrement. Harebrained staging of an 
abortion, of a self-giving
birth ever miscarried, endlessly to be 
renewed, the hope for
rebirth is short-circuited by the very 
splitting: the advent of
one's own identity demands a law that 
mutilates, whereas
jouissance demands an abjection from 
which identity becomes
absent.

SOMETHING TO BE SCARED OF 55

This erotic cult of the abject makes 
one think of a perversion,
but it must be distinguished at once 
from what simply dodges
castration. For even if our 
borderlander is, like any speaking
being, subject to castration to the 
extent that he must deal with
the symbolic, he in fact runs a far 
greater risk than others do.
It is not a part of himself, vital 
though it may be, that he is
threatened with losing, but his whole 
life. To preserve himself
from severance, he is ready for 
more—flow, discharge, hemorrhage. All 
mortal. Freud had, in enigmatic 
fashion, noted in
connection with melancholy: "wound," 
"internal hemorrhage," "a hole in the 
psyche."16 The erotization of abjection,
and perhaps any abjection to the extent 
that it is already ero- ;
ticized, is an attempt at stopping the 
hemorrhage: a threshold
before death, a halt or a respite?

| Abjection [. . .] is merely the 
inability to assume with sufficient
strength the imperative act of 
excluding abject things (and that act
establishes the foundations of 
collective existence).
[. . .] The act of exclusion has the 
same meaning as social or divine
sovereignty, but it is not located on 
the same level; it is precisely
located in the domain of things and 
not, like sovereignty, in the
domain of persons. It differs from the 
latter in the same way that anal
eroticism differs from sadism.
Georges Bataille, Essais de sociologie

MOTHER-PHOBIA AND THE MURDER OF THE 
FATHER
In psychoanalysis as in anthropology 
one commonly links the
sacred and the establishment of the 
religious bond that it presupposes with 
sacrifice. Freud tied the sacred to 
taboo and totemism,1 and concluded 
that, "we consider ourselves justified 
in
substituting the father for the totem 
animal in the male's formula of 
totemism."2 We are all familiar with 
that Freudian
thesis as to the murder of the father 
and, more specifically, with
the one he develops in Moses and 
Monotheism: in connection with
Judaic religion the archaic father and 
master of the primeval
horde is killed by the conspiring sons 
who, later seized with
a sense of guilt for an act that was 
upon the whole inspired by
ambivalent feelings, end up restoring 
paternal authority, no
longer as an arbitrary power but as a 
right; thus renouncing the
possession of all women in their turn, 
they establish at one
stroke the sacred, exogamy, and society.
There is nevertheless a strange 
slippage in the Freudian argument, one 
that has not been sufficiently noticed. 
Relying on

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 57

numerous readings in ethnology and the 
history of religions,
more specifically on Frazer and 
Robertson Smith, Freud notes
that the morality of man starts with 
"the two taboos of totemism"—murder and 
incest.3 Totem and Taboo begins with an
evocation of the "dread of incest," and 
Freud discusses it at
length in connection with taboo, 
totemism, and more specifically with 
food and sex prohibitions. The woman- 
or motherimage haunts a large part of 
that book and keeps shaping its
background even when, relying on the 
testimony of obsessional
neurotics, Freud slips from dread (p. 
23: "His incest dread"; p.
24: "the incest dread of savages"; p. 
161: "The interpretation
of incest dread," "This dread of 
incest") to the inclusion of
dread symptom in obsessional neurosis. 
At the same time he
leaves off speculating on incest ("we 
do not know the origin
of incest dread and do not even know 
how to guess at it," p.
162) in order to center his conclusion 
in the second taboo, the
one against murder, which he reveals to 
be the murder of the
father.
That such a murderous event could be as 
much mythical as
endowed with founding properties, that 
it should be both the
keystone to the desire henceforth known 
as Oedipal and a severance that sets up 
a signifier admitting of logical 
concatenation,
analytic attention now knows only too 
well. Divergences from
and even contradictions with this 
Freudian thesis4 are finally no
more than variants and confirmations. 
What will concern me
here is not that aspect of the Freudian 
position, which I shall
consider to have been logically 
established. I shall attempt to
question the other side of the 
religious phenomenon, the one
that Freud points to when he brings up 
dread, incest, and the
mother; one that, even though it is 
presented as the second
taboo founding religion, nevertheless 
disappears during the final
elucidation of the problem.
THE TWO-SIDED SACRED
Could the sacred be, whatever its 
variants, a two-sided formation? One 
aspect founded by murder and the social 
bond
made up of murder's guilt-ridden, 
atonement, with all the pro-

58

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

jective mechanisms and obsessive 
rituals that accompany it; and
another aspect, like a lining, more 
secret still and invisible, 
nonrepresentable, oriented toward those 
uncertain spaces of unstable identity, 
toward the fragility—both threatening 
and fusional—of the archaic dyad, 
toward the non-separation of 
subject/object, on which language has 
no hold but one woven of
fright and repulsion? One aspect is 
defensive and socializing,
the other shows fear and 
indifferentiation. The similarities that
Freud delineates between religion and 
obsessional neurosis
would then involve the defensive side 
of the sacred. Now, to
throw light on the subjective economy 
of its other side, it is
phobia as such, and its drifting toward 
psychosis, that one
would need to tackle head on.
"
That, at any rate, will be my point of 
departure. For we shall
see, in a large number of rituals and 
discourses involved in
making up the sacred—notably those 
dealing with defilement
and its derivations in different 
religions—an attempt at coding
the other taboo that the earliest 
ethnologists and psychoanalysts
viewed as presiding over social 
formations: beside death, incest.
Levi-Strauss' structural anthropology 
has shown how all systems of knowledge 
in so-called primitive societies, and 
myths
in particular, are a later elaboration, 
within stages of symbolicity, of the 
prohibition that weighs on incest and 
founds the
signifying function as well as the 
social aggregate. What will
concern me here is not the socially 
productive value of the sonmother 
incest prohibition but the alterations, 
within subjectivity
and within the very symbolic 
competence, implied by the 
confrontation with the feminine and the 
way in which societies code
themselves in order to accompany as far 
as possible the speaking
subject on that journey. Abjection, or 
the journey to the end
of the night.
PROHIBITED INCEST VS. COMING FACE TO 
FACE WITH
THE UNNAMABLE
What we designate as "feminine," far 
from being a primeval
essence, will be seen as an "other" 
without a name, which
subjective experience confronts when it 
does not stop at the

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

appearance of its identity. Assuming 
that any Other is appended
to the triangulating function of the 
paternal prohibition, what
will be dealt with here, beyond and 
through the paternal function, is a 
coming face to face with an unnamable 
otherness—
the solid rock of jouissance and 
writing as well.
I shall set aside in this essay a 
different version of the confrontation 
with the feminine, one that, going 
beyond abjection
and fright, is enunciated as ecstatic. 
"The light-suffused face
of the young Persian god" Freud refers 
to, and similarly, in a
more secular fashion, Mallarme's claim 
to be that "startled
hero," "merry" for having overcome the 
"dishevelled tuft"—
both point to another manner of coming 
to terms with the
unnamable. That kind of confrontation 
appears, where our civilization is 
concerned, only in a few rare flashes 
of writing.
Celine's laughter, beyond horror, also 
comes close to it,
perhaps.
NARCISSUS AND MURKY WATERS
Freud had strongly emphasized, at the 
outset of Totem and
Taboo, "man's deep aversion to his 
former incest wishes" (p.
24). He had reminded us of the 
properties of the taboo: it is
"sacred, consecrated; but on the other 
hand it means uncanny,
dangerous, forbidden and unclean" (p. 
26); as to the object of
taboos, "The prohibition mostly 
concerns matters that are capable of 
enjoyment" [Genussgejahig] (p. 31), 
they include the
"unclean" (p. 32). The contact 
avoidance that he observes in
it nevertheless makes him think only of 
compulsion and its
rituals, while the ambivalent hostility 
it harbors suggests to him
paranoid projection. The two structures 
cause the threat that
would be hovering over the subject to 
converge on the paternal
apex—the one that prohibits, separates, 
prevents contact (between son and 
mother?). This hypothesis would suggest 
an
idyllic dual relationship 
(mother-child), which, to the extent
that the father prevents it, changes 
into an ulterior aversion to
incest. The idea of such a soothing 
dual relationship crops up
again when Freud draws up the 
hypothesis of a transition between the 
primeval horde and civilized society, 
transition in

59

60

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

which the sons, out of "maternal 
love,"5 and/or supported by
"homosexual feelings and activities" 
(p. 186), would renounce
mothers and sisters and set up an 
organization based at first on
matriarchal law, and ultimately on 
patriarchal law.
Nevertheless there are other thoughts 
of Freud, from which
he will not draw any conclusions, that 
allow one to progress
in another direction. He first appears 
to refer states of fear and
impurity to primary narcissism, a 
narcissism laden with hostility and 
which does not yet know its limits. For 
we are dealing
with imprecise boundaries in that 
place, at that moment, where
pain is born out of an excess of 
fondness and a hate that, refusing
to admit the satisfaction it also 
provides, is projected toward
an other. Inside and outside are not 
precisely differentiated here,
nor is language an active practice or 
the subject separated from
the other. Melanie Klein will make of 
this area her privileged
field of observation; it is well known 
that Winnicot found in
it a fruitful terrain for the etiology 
of psychoses and "false
selves" as well as for creation and 
play. But it is Freud indeed
who blazes the trail. Let us read more 
carefully the following
passages, which can be understood in 
another way than as preludes to the 
obsessional or paranoid structure.
Under conditions whose nature has not 
yet been sufficiently established, 
internal perceptions of emotional and 
thought processes can
be projected outwards in the same way 
as sense perceptions; they are
thus employed for building up the 
external world, though they should
by rights remain part of the internal 
world. This may have some
genetic connection with the fact that 
the function of attention was
originally directed not towards the 
internal world but towards the
stimuli that stream in from the 
external world, and that that function's
only information upon endopsychic 
processes was received from feelings of 
pleasure and unpleasure. It was not 
until a language of abstract
thought had been developed, that is to 
say, not until the sensory
residues of verbal presentations had 
been linked to the internal processes, 
that the latter themselves gradually 
became capable of being
perceived. Before that, owing to the 
projection outwards of internal
perceptions, primitive men arrived at a 
picture of the external world
which we, with our intensified 
conscious perception, have now to
translate back into psychology.6

And further along, in a footnote:
The projected creations of primitive 
men resemble the personifications
constructed by creative writers; for 
the latter externalize in the form
of separate individuals the opposing 
instinctual impulses struggling
within them.7
INCEST AND THE PRE-VERBAL
Let me sum up. There would be a 
"beginning" preceding the
word. Freud, echoing Goethe, says so at 
the end of Totem and
Taboo: "In the beginning was the 
deed."8 In that anteriority
to language, the outside is elaborated 
by means of a projection
from within, of which the only 
experience we have is one of
pleasure and pain. An outside in the 
image of the inside, made
of pleasure and pain. The 
non-distinctiveness of inside and 
outside would thus be unnamable, a 
border passable in both directions by 
pleasure and pain. Naming the latter, 
hence differentiating them, amounts to 
introducing language, which, just
as it distinguishes pleasure from pain 
as it does all other oppositions, 
founds the separation inside/outside. 
And yet, there
would be witnesses to the perviousness 
of the limit, artisans
after a fashion who would try to tap 
that pre-verbal "beginning"
within a word that is flush with 
pleasure and pain. They are
primitive man through his ambivalences 
and the poet through the
personification of his opposing states 
of feeling—but also perhaps through the 
rhetorical recasting of language that 
he effects
and over which Freud, who says he is 
heedful and fascinated,
never tarries. If the murder of the 
father is that historical event
constituting the social code as such, 
that is, symbolic exchange
and the exchange of women, its 
equivalent on the level of the
subjective history of each individual 
is therefore the advent of
language, which breaks with 
perviousness if not with the chaos
that precedes it and sets up 
denomination as an exchange of
linguistic signs. Poetic language would 
then be, contrary to
murder and the univocity of verbal 
message, a reconciliation
with what murder as well as names were 
separated from. It
would be an attempt to symbolize the 
"beginning," an attempt

62 FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

to name the other facet of taboo: 
pleasure, pain. Are we finally
dealing with incest?
Not quite, or not directly. When Freud 
again speaks, still in
Totem and Taboo, "of the first 
beginnings in childhood" of
libidinal trends, he asserts that "from 
the very first" "they are
not yet directed toward any external 
object." As he did in Three
Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, he 
calls autoeroticism the
phase which gives way to object-choice. 
Nevertheless he inserts
between the two stages a third one that 
will hold our attention.
In this intermediary stage [. . .] the 
sexual impulses which formerly
were separate have already formed into 
a unit and have also found an
object; but this object is not external 
and foreign to the individual,
but is his own ego, which is formed at 
this period.9
Fixation at this stage will be called 
narcissism. Let me try to
point out the latent meanings of the 
definition. Narcissism is
predicated on the existence of the ego 
but not of an external
object; we are faced with the strange 
correlation between an
entity (the ego) and its converse (the 
object), which is nevertheless not yet 
constituted; with an "ego" in relation 
to a nonobject.
Two consequences seem necessarily to 
follow from such a
structure. On the one hand, the 
non-constitution of the (outside) 
object as such renders unstable the 
ego's identity, which
could not be precisely established 
without having been differentiated from 
an other, from its object. The ego of 
primary
narcissism is thus uncertain, fragile, 
threatened, subjected just
as much as its non-object to spatial 
ambivalence (inside/outside
uncertainty) and to ambiguity of 
perception (pleasure/pain). On
the other hand, one has to admit that 
such a narcissistic topology
has no other underpinning in 
psychosomatic reality than the
mother-child dyad. Now, though that 
relation has always been
immersed in language, it allows the 
latter's inscription in the
future subject only when 
biophysiological preconditions and
the conditions of the Oedipus complex 
permit the setting up
of a triadic relationship. The 
subject's active use of the signifier
truly dates only from this moment. By 
stressing the inherence
of language in the human state, by 
overestimating the subject's

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 63

having been the slave of language since 
before his birth, one
avoids noting the two moods, active and 
passive, according to
which the subject is constituted in the 
signifier; by the same
token one neglects the economy of 
narcissism in the elaboration
and practice of the symbolic function.
That having been said, the archaic 
relation to the mother,
narcissistic though it may be, is from 
my point of view of no
solace to the protagonists and even 
less so to Narcissus. For the
subject will always be marked by the 
uncertainty of his borders
and of his affective valency as well; 
these are all the more determining as 
the paternal function was weak or even 
nonexistent, opening the door to 
perversion or psychosis. The edenic
image of primary narcissism is perhaps 
a defensive negation
elaborated by the neurotic subject when 
he sets himself under
the aegis of the father. On the other 
hand, patients who have
recently come to the couch (borderline 
cases, false selves, etc.)
reveal the horror of that dual war, its 
terror, and the ensuing
fear of being rotten, drained, or 
blocked.
DEFILEMENT AS RITUAL RESCUE FROM PHOBIA
AND PSYCHOSIS
This abjection, which threatens the ego 
and results from the
dual confrontation in which the 
uncertainties of primary narcissism 
reside—is it such as to motivate, if 
not explain, the
incest dread of which Freud speaks? I 
believe so. If it be true,
as Claude Levi-Strauss has 
demonstrated, that the prohibition
of incest has the logical import of 
founding, by means of that
very prohibition, the discreteness of 
interchangeable units, thus
establishing social order and the 
symbolic, I shall maintain that
such a logical operation is carried out 
owing to a subjective
benefit derived from it on the level of 
libidinal economy. Incest
prohibition throws a veil over primary 
narcissism and the always ambivalent 
threats with which it menaces 
subjective identity. It cuts short the 
temptation to return, with abjection and
jouissance, to that passivity status 
within the symbolic function,
where the subject, fluctuating between 
inside and outside, pleasure and pain, 
word and deed, would find death, along 
with

64

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

nirvana. Phobia alone, crossroad of 
neurosis and psychosis, and
of course conditions verging on 
psychosis, testify to the appeal
of such a risk; as if, with regard to 
it, the taboo barring contact
with the mother and/or primary 
narcissism suddenly
disintegrated.
A whole facet of the sacred, true 
lining of the sacrificial,
compulsive, and paranoid side of 
religions, assumes the task
of warding off that danger. This is 
precisely where we encounter
the rituals of defilement and their 
derivatives, which, based on
the feeling of abjection and all 
converging on the maternal,
attempt to symbolize the other threat 
to the subject: that of
being swamped by the dual relationship, 
thereby risking the
loss not of a part (castration) but of 
the totality of his living
being. The function of these religious 
rituals is to ward off the
subject's fear of his very own identity 
sinking irretrievably into
the mother.
THE POVERTY OF PROHIBITION: GEORGES 
BATAILLE
The logic of prohibition, which founds 
the abject, has been
outlined and made explicit by a number 
of anthropologists
concerned with defilement and its 
sacred function in so-called
primitive societies. And yet Georges 
Bataille remains the only
one, to my knowledge, who has linked 
the production of the
abject to the weakness of that 
prohibition, which, in other respects,
necessarily constitutes each social 
order. He links abjection to
"the inability to assume with 
sufficient strength the imperative
act of excluding." Bataille is also the 
first to have specified that
the plane of abjection is that of the 
subject/object relationsip (and
not subject/other subject) and that 
this archaism is rooted in
anal eroticism rather than sadism.10
In the following, my point will be to 
suggest that such an
archaic relationship to the object 
interprets, as it were, the 
relationship to the mother. Her being 
coded as "abject" points to
the considerable importance some 
societies attribute to women
(matrilineal or related filiation, 
endogamy, decisive role of procreation 
for the survival of the social group, 
etc.). The symbolic
"exclusory prohibition" that, as a 
matter of fact, constitutes
collective existence does not seem to 
have, in such cases, suf-

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 65

ficient strength to dam up the abject 
or demoniacal potential
of the feminine. The latter, precisely 
on account of its power,
does not succeed in differentiating 
itself as other but threatens
one's own and clean self, which is the 
underpinning of any organization 
constituted by exclusions and 
hierarchies.
But before outlining the weakness of 
prohibition and finally the
matrilineal order that can be perceived 
in those communities, let
us return to the anthropological 
delineation of the logic of exclusion 
that causes the abject to exist.
THE FUNDAMENTAL WORK OF MARY DOUGLAS
Anthropologists, since Sir James George 
Frazer, W. Robertson
Smith, Arnold van Gennep, and Alfred 
Reginald RadcliffBrown, or Rudolf 
Steiner, have noted that secular 
"filth,"
which has become sacred "defilement," 
is the excluded on the
basis of which religious prohibition is 
made up. In a number
of primitive societies religious rites 
are purification rites whose
function is to separate this or that 
social, sexual, or age group
from another one, by means of 
prohibiting a filthy, defiling
element. It is as if dividing lines 
were built up between society
and a certain nature, as well as within 
the social aggregate, on
the basis of the simple logic of 
excluding filth, which, promoted
to the ritual level of defilement, 
founded the "self and clean" of
each social group if not of each 
subject.
The purification rite appears then as 
that essential ridge,
which, prohibiting the filthy object, 
extracts it from the secular
order and lines it at once with a 
sacred facet. Because it is
excluded as a possible object, asserted 
to be a non-object of
desire, abominated as ab-ject, as 
abjection, filth becomes defilement and 
founds on the henceforth released side 
of the "self
and clean" the order that is thus only 
(and therefore, always
already) sacred.
Defilement is what is jettisoned from 
the "symbolic system."
It is what escapes that social 
rationality, that logical order on
which a social aggregate is based, 
which then becomes differentiated from 
a temporary agglomeration of 
individuals and,
in short, constitutes a classification 
system or a structure.
The British anthropologist Mary Douglas 
begins by con-

66

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

struing the "symbolic system" of 
religious prohibitions as a
reflection of social divisions or even 
contradictions. As if the
social being, coextensive with a 
"symbolic system," were always present 
to itself through its religious 
structures, which
transfer its contradictions to the 
level of rituals. And yet, at a
second stage of her thinking, Mary 
Douglas seems to find in
the human body the prototype of that 
translucid being constituted by society 
as symbolic system. As a matter of 
fact, the
explanation she gives of defilement 
assigns in turn different
statuses to the human body: as ultimate 
cause of the socioeconomic causality, 
or simply as metaphor of that 
socio-symbolic being constituted by the 
human universe always present
to itself. In so doing, however, Mary 
Douglas introduces willynilly the 
possibility of a subjective dimension 
within anthropological thought on 
religions. Where then lies the 
subjective
value of those demarcations, 
exclusions, and prohibitions that
establish the social organism as a 
"symbolic system"? The anthropological 
analysis of these phenomena was for 
Mary Douglas essentially syntactic at 
first: defilement is an element 
connected
with the boundary, the margin, etc., of 
an order. Henceforth
she finds herself led to semantic 
problems: what is the meaning
that such a border-element assumes in 
other psychological,
economic, etc., systems? At this moment 
of her thinking there
emerges a concern to integrate Freudian 
data as semantic values
connected with the psychosomatic 
functioning of the speaking
subject. But a hasty assimilation of 
such data leads Mary Douglas naively to 
reject Freudian premises.
Finally, such a conception disregards 
both subjective dynamics
(if one wishes to consider the social 
set in its utmost particularization) 
and language as common and universal 
code (if one wishes
to consider the aggregate and the 
social aggregates in their
greatest generality). Levi-Strauss' 
structural anthropology had
one advantage among others; it linked a 
classification system,
that is, a symbolic system, within a 
given society, to the order
of language in its universality (binary 
aspects of phonology,
signifier-signified dependencies and 
autonomies, etc.). In thus
attaining universal truth, it 
nevertheless neglected the subjective
dimension and/or the diachronic and 
synchronic implication of
the speaking subject in the universal 
order of language.

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 67

Consequently, when I speak of symbolic 
order, I shall imply
the dependence and articulation of the 
speaking subject in the
order of language, such as they appear 
diachronically in the
advent of each speaking being, and as 
analytic listening discovers them 
synchronically in the speech of 
analysands. I shall
consider as an established fact the 
analytic finding that different
subjective structures are possible 
within that symbolic order,
even if the different types presently 
recorded seem subject to
discussion and refinement, if not 
reevaluation.
One might advance the hypothesis that a 
(social) symbolic
system corresponds to a specific 
structuration of the speaking
subject in the symbolic order. To say 
that it "corresponds" leaves
out questions of cause and effect; is 
the social determined by
the subjective, or is it the other way 
around? The subjectivesymbolic 
dimension that I am introducing does 
not therefore
reinstate some deep or primary 
causality in the social symbolic
system. It merely presents the effects 
and especially the benefits
that accrue to the speaking subject 
from a precise symbolic
organization; perhaps it explains what 
desiring motives are required in order 
to maintain a given social symbolics. 
Furthermore, it seems to me that such a 
statement of the problem has
the advantage of not turning the 
"symbolic system" into a
secular replica of the "preestablished 
harmony" or the '"divine
order"; rather, it roots it, as a 
possible variant, within the only
concrete universality that defines the 
speaking being—the signifying process.
IN THE SAME FASHION AS INCEST 
PROHIBITION
We are now in a position to recall what 
was suggested earlier
concerning that border of subjectivity 
where the object no
longer has, or does not yet have a 
correlative function bonding
the subject. On that location, to the 
contrary, the vacillating,
fascinating, threatening, and dangerous 
object is silhouetted as
non-being—as the abjection into which 
the speaking being is
permanently engulfed.
Defilement, by means of the rituals 
that consecrate it, is perhaps, for a 
social aggregate, only one of the 
possible foundings
of abjection bordering the frail 
identity of the speaking being.

68

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

In this sense, abjection is coextensive 
with social and symbolic
order, on the individual as well as on 
the collective level. By
virtue of this, abjection, just like 
prohibition of incest, is a universal
phenomenon; one encounters it as soon 
as the symbolic and/or
social dimension of man is constituted, 
and this throughout the
course of civilization. But abjection 
assumes specific shapes and
different codings according to the 
various "symbolic systems."
I shall attempt to examine some of its 
variants: defilement, food
taboo, and sin.
Socio-historical considerations can be 
brought in at a second
stage. They will allow us to understand 
why that demarcating
imperative, which is subjectively 
experienced as abjection, varies 
according to time and space, even 
though it is universal. I
shall nevertheless stick to a 
typological argument. Prohibitions
and conflicts that are specific to a 
given subject and ritualized
by religion for a given type of body 
will appear as isomorphic
with the prohibitions and conflicts of 
the social group within
which they happen. Leaving aside the 
question of the priority
of one over the other (the social does 
not represent the subjective
any more than the subjective represents 
the social), I shall posit
that they both follow the same logic, 
with no other goal than
the survival of both group and subject.
My reflections will make their way 
through anthropological
domains and analyses in order to aim at 
a deep psycho-symbolic
economy: the general, logical 
determination that underlies 
anthropological variants (social 
structures, marriage rules, religious 
rites) and evinces a specific economy 
of the speaking
subject, no matter what its historical 
manifestations may be
In short, an economy that analytic 
listening and semanalytic
deciphering discover in our 
contemporaries. Such a procedure
seems to me to be directly in keeping 
with Freudian utilization
of anthropological data. It inevitably 
entails a share of disappointment for 
the empirically minded ethnologist. It 
does not
unfold without a share of fiction, the 
nucleus of which, drawn
from actuality and the subjective 
experience of the one who
writes, is projected upon data 
collected from the life of other
cultures, less to justify itself than 
to throw light on them by
means of an interpretation to which 
they obviously offer
resistance.

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 69

THE MARGIN OF A FLOATING STRUCTURE
Taking a closer look at defilement, as 
Mary Douglas has done,
one ascertains the following. In the 
first place, filth is not a
quality in itself, but it applies only 
to what relates to a boundary
and, more particularly, represents the 
object jettisoned out of
that boundary, its other side, a margin.
Matter issuing from them [the orifices 
of the body] is marginal stuff
of the most obvious kind. Spittle, 
blood, milk, urine, faeces or tears
by simply issuing forth have traversed 
the boundary of the body.
[. . .] The mistake is to treat bodily 
margins in isolation from all other
margins.11
The potency of pollution is therefore 
not an inherent one; it
is proportional to the potency of the 
prohibition that founds
it.
It follows from this that pollution is 
a type of danger which is not
likely to occur except where the lines 
of structure, cosmic or social,
are clearly defined.12
Finally, even if human beings are 
involved with it, the dangers entailed 
by defilement are not within their 
power to deal
with but depend on a power "inhering in 
the structure of
ideas."13 Let us posit that defilement 
is an objective evil undergone by the 
subject. Or, to put it another way, the 
danger of
filth represents for the subject the 
risk to which the very symbolic order 
is permanently exposed, to the extent 
that it is a
device of discriminations, of 
differences. But from where and
from what does the threat issue? From 
nothing else but an
equally objective reason, even if 
individuals can contribute to
it, and which would be, in a way, the 
frailty of the symbolic
order itself. A threat issued from the 
prohibitions that found
the inner and outer borders in which 
and through which the
speaking subject is constituted—borders 
also determined by the
phonological and semantic differences 
that articulate the syntax
of language.
And yet, in the light of this 
structural-functional X-ray of
defilement, which draws on the major 
anthropological works
of modern times, from Robertson Smith 
to Marcel Mauss, from
Emile Durkheim to Levi-Strauss, one 
question remains unan-

70 FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

swered. Why does corporeal waste, 
menstrual blood and excrement, or 
everything that is assimilated to them, 
from nail-parings to decay, 
represent—like a metaphor that would 
have
become incarnate—the objective frailty 
of symbolic order?
One might be tempted at first to seek 
the answer in a type
of society where defilement takes the 
place of supreme danger
or absolute evil.
BETWEEN TWO POWERS
Nevertheless, no matter what 
differences there may be among
societies where religious prohibitions, 
which are above all behavior 
prohibitions, are supposed to afford 
protection from
defilement, one sees everywhere the 
importance, both social
and symbolic, of women and particularly 
the mother. In societies where it 
occurs, ritualization of defilement is 
accompanied by a strong concern for 
separating the sexes, and this means
giving men rights over women. The 
latter, apparently put in
the position of passive objects, are 
none the less felt to be wily
powers, "baleful schemers" from whom 
rightful beneficiaries
must protect themselves. It is as if, 
lacking a central authoritarian power 
that would settle the definitive 
supremacy of one
sex—or lacking a legal establishment 
that would balance the
prerogatives of both sexes—two powers 
attempted to share out
society. One of them, the masculine, 
apparently victorious,
confesses through its very 
relentlessness against the other, the
feminine, that it is threatened by an 
asymmetrical, irrational,
wily, uncontrollable power. Is this a 
survival of a matrilineal
society or the specific particularity 
of a structure (without the
incidence of diachrony)? The question 
of the origins of such a
handling of sexual difference remains 
moot. But whether it be
within the highly hierarchical society 
of India or the Lele in
Africa14 it is always to be noticed 
that the attempt to establish
a male, phallic power is vigorously 
threatened by the no less
virulent power of the other sex, which 
is oppressed (recently?
or not sufficiently for the survival 
needs of society?). That other
sex, the feminine, becomes synonymous 
with a radical evil that
is to be suppressed.15

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

Let us keep that fact in mind; I shall 
return to it later on for
the interpretation of defilement and 
its rites. In the meantime
I turn to the particulars—the 
prohibited objects and the symbolic 
devices that accompany those 
prohibitions.
EXCREMENTS AND MENSTRUAL BLOOD
While they always relate to corporeal 
orifices as to so many
landmarks parceling-constituting the 
body's territory, polluting
objects fall, schematically, into two 
types: excremental and
menstrual. Neither tears nor sperm, for 
instance, although they
belong to borders of the body, have any 
polluting value.
Excrement and its equivalents (decay, 
infection, disease,
corpse, etc.) stand for the danger to 
identity that comes from
without: the ego threatened by the 
non-ego, society threatened
by its outside, life by death. 
Menstrual blood, on the contrary,
stands for the danger issuing from 
within the identity (social
or sexual); it threatens the 
relationship between the sexes within
a social aggregate and, through 
internalization, the identity of
each sex in the face of sexual 
difference.
MATERNAL AUTHORITY AS TRUSTEE OF THE 
SELF'S
CLEAN AND PROPER BODY
What can the two types of defilement 
have in common? Without
having recourse to anal eroticism or 
the fear of castration—one
cannot help hearing the reticence of 
anthropologists when confronted with 
that explanation—it might be suggested, 
by means
of another psychoanalytic approach, 
that those two defilements
stem from the maternal and/or the 
feminine, of which the maternal is the 
real support. That goes without saying 
where
menstrual blood signifies sexual 
difference. But what about
excrement? It will be remembered that 
the anal penis is also the
phallus with which infantile 
imagination provides the feminine
sex and that, on the other hand, 
maternal authority is experienced first 
and above all, after the first 
essentially oral frustrations, as 
sphincteral training. It is as if, 
while having been forever immersed in 
the symbolics of language, the human 
being

71

72

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

experienced, in addition, an authority 
that was a—chronologically and 
logically immediate—repetition of the 
laws of language. Through frustrations 
and prohibitions, this authority
shapes the body into a territory having 
areas, orifices, points and
lines, surfaces and hollows, where the 
archaic power of mastery
and neglect, of the differentiation of 
proper-clean and improperdirty, 
possible and impossible, is impressed 
and exerted. It is
a "binary logic," a primal mapping of 
the body that I call
semiotic to say that, while being the 
precondition of language,
it is dependent upon meaning, but in a 
way that is not that of
linguistic signs nor of the symbolic 
order they found. Maternal
authority is the trustee of that 
mapping of the self s clean and
proper body; it is distinguished from 
paternal laws within
which, with the phallic phase and 
acquisition of language, the
destiny of man will take shape.
If language, like culture, sets up a 
separation and, starting
with discrete elements, concatenates an 
order, it does so precisely by 
repressing maternal authority and the 
corporeal mapping that abuts against 
them. It is then appropriate to ask what
happens to such a repressed item when 
the legal, phallic, linguistic symbolic 
establishment does not carry out the 
separation
in radical fashion—or else, more 
basically, when the speaking
being attempts to think through its 
advent in order better to
establish its effectiveness.

DEFILEMENT RITE—A SOCIAL ELABORATION OF 
THE
BORDERLINE PATIENT?
The structuralist hypothesis is well 
known. Basic symbolic institutions; 
such as sacrifice or myths, expand on 
logical processes
inherent in the economy of language 
itself; in doing so they
realize for the community what makes up 
in depth, historically
and logically, the speaking being as 
such. Thus myth projects
on contents that are vitally important 
for a given community
those binary oppositions discovered at 
the level of phonematic
concatenation of language. As for 
sacrifice, it solemnizes the
vertical dimension of the sign: the one 
that leads from the thing

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

that is left behind, or killed, to the 
meaning of the word and
transcendence.
Following that line, one could suggest 
that the rites surrounding defilement, 
particularly those involving 
excremential
and menstrual variants, shift the 
border (in the psychoanalytic
meaning relating to borderline 
patients) that separates the
body's territory from the signifying 
chain; they illustrate the
boundary between semiotic authority and 
symbolic law. Through
language and within highly hierarchical 
religious institutions,
man hallucinates partial 
"objects"—witnesses to an archaic 
differentiation of the body on its way 
toward ego identity, which
is also sexual identity. The defilement 
from which ritual protects
us is neither sign nor matter. Within 
the rite that extracts it
from repression and depraved desire, 
defilement is the translinguistic spoor 
of the most archaic boundaries of the 
self's
clean and proper body. In that sense, 
if it is a jettisoned object,
it is so from the mother. It absorbs 
within itself all the experiences of 
the non-objectal that accompany the 
differentiation
mother-speaking being, hence all 
ab-jects (from those the phobic shuns 
to those that hem in split subjects). 
As if purification
rites, through a language that is 
already there, looked back
toward an archaic experience and 
obtained from it a partialobject, not 
as such but only as a spoor of a 
pre-object, an archaic
parceling. By means of the symbolic 
institution of ritual, that
is to say, by means of a system of 
ritual exclusions, the partialobject 
consequently becomes scription—an 
inscription of limits,
an emphasis placed not on the 
(paternal) Law but on (maternal)
Authority through the very signifying 
order.
There follows something quite 
particular for the ritual device
itself.
A SCRIPTION WITHOUT SIGNS
First, those rites concerning 
defilement (but perhaps also any
rite, defilement rite being 
prototypical) effect'an abreaction of
the pre-sign impact, the semiotic 
impact of language. In any
event it is thus that one can underpin 
anthropologists' definitions, according 
to which rites are acts rather than 
symbols. In

73

74

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

other words, rites would not be limited 
to their signifying
dimension, they would also have a 
material, active, translinguistic, 
magical impact.
In the second place, the strong 
ritualization of defilement,
which may be observed, for instance, 
within the castes of India,
appears to be accompanied by one's 
being totally blind to filth
itself, even though it is the object of 
those rites. It is as if one
had maintained, so to speak, only the 
sacred, prohibited facet
of defilement, allowing the anal object 
that such a sacralization
had in view to become lost within the 
dazzling light of unconsciousness if 
not of the unconscious. V. S. Naipaul 
points out
that Hindus defecate everywhere without 
anyone ever mentioning, either in 
speech or in books, those squatting 
figures,
because, quite simply, no one sees 
them.16 It is not a form of
censorship due to modesty that would 
demand the omission
in discourse of a function that has, in 
other respects, been ritualized. It is 
blunt foreclosure that voids those acts 
and objects
from conscious representation. A split 
seems to have set in
between, on the one hand, the body's 
territory where an authority without 
guilt prevails, a kind of fusion 
between mother
and nature, and on the other hand, a 
totally different universe
of socially signifying performances 
where embarrassment,
shame, guilt, desire, etc. come into 
play—the order of the
phallus. Such a split, which in another 
cultural universe would
produce psychosis, thus finds in this 
context a perfect socialization. That 
may be because setting up the rite of 
defilement
takes on the function of the hyphen, 
the virgule, allowing the
two universes of filth and of 
prohibition to brush lightly against
each other without necessarily being 
identified as such, as object
and as law. On account of the 
flexibility at work in rites of
defilement, the subjective economy of 
the speaking being who
is involved abuts on both edges of the 
unnamable (the nonobject, the 
off-limits) and the absolute (the 
relentless coherence
of Prohibition, sole donor of Meaning).
Finally, the frequency of defilement 
rites in societies without
writing leads one to think that such 
cathartic rites function like
a "writing of the real." They parcel 
out, demarcate, delineate
an order, a framework, a sociality, 
without having any other

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 75

signification than the one inhering in 
that very parceling and
the order thus concatenated. One might 
ask, proceeding in
reverse, if all writing is not a second 
level rite, at the level of
language, that is, which causes one to 
be reminded, through
the linguistic signs themselves, of the 
demarcations that precondition them and 
go beyond them. Indeed, writing causes
the subject who ventures in it to 
confront an archaic authority,
on the nether side of the proper Name. 
The maternal connotations of this 
authority never escaped great writers, 
no more
than the coming face to face with what 
we have called abjection.
From "I am Madame Bovary" to Molly's 
monologue and to
Celine's emotion, which does injury to 
syntax before opening
on to music, the ballerina, or nothing.
POLLUTION BY FOOD—A COMPOUND
When food appears as a polluting 
object, it does so as oral object
only to the extent that orality 
signifies a boundary of the self s
clean and proper body. Food becomes 
abject only if it is a
border between two distinct entities or 
territories. A boundary
between nature and culture, between the 
human and the nonhuman. This may be 
noticed in India and Polynesia, for 
instance, in the case of cooked foods 
whose vulnerability to impurity is 
characteristic.17 In contrast to a ripe 
fruit that may be
eaten without danger, food that is 
treated with fire is polluting
and must be surrounded with a series of 
taboos. It is as if fire,
contrary to what hygienist conceptions 
posit, far from purifying, pointed to a 
contact, to organic food's meddling with
the familial and the social. The 
virtual impurity of such food
comes close to excremential abjection, 
which is the most striking example of 
the interference of the organic within 
the social.
The fact remains nevertheless that all 
food is liable to defile.
Thus the Brahmin who surrounds his meal 
and his food with
very strict regulations is less pure 
after eating than before. Food
in this instance designates the other 
(the natural) that is opposed
to the social condition of man and 
penetrates the self s clean and
proper body. In other respects, food is 
the oral object (the abject) that sets 
up archaic relationships between the 
human being

j6

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

and the other, its mother, who wields a 
power that is as vital
as it is fierce.
THE REMAINDER: DEFILEMENT AND REBIRTH
The nature of the repulsion aroused by 
food remainders in Brahmanism is very 
significant from that point of view. 
More defiling still than any other 
food, they do not seem to be so on
account of that ambivalence, duplicity, 
or permanent or potential compound 
between same and other that all 
nourishment
signifies, as I have just shown. 
Remainders are residues of something 
but especially of someone. They pollute 
on account of
incompleteness. Under certain 
conditions, however, the Brahmin can 
eat remainders, which, instead of 
polluting him, make
him qualified to undertake a journey or 
even accomplish his
specific office, the priestly act.
That ambivalence of residues (pollution 
and potential for renewal, remainder 
and fresh start) can also be seen in 
domains
unrelated to food. Some cosmogonies 
represent the remainder,
after the flood, in the shape of a 
serpent that becomes the supporter of 
Vishnu and thus insures the rebirth of 
the universe.
In similar fashion, if what remains of 
a sacrifice can be called
abject, in another connection consuming 
the leavings of a sacrifice can also be 
the cause of a series of good rebirths 
and can
even lead to finding salvation. The 
remainder is thus a strongly
ambivalent notion in 
Brahmanism—defilement as well as 
rebirth, abjection as much as high 
purity, obstacle at the same
time as incentive toward holiness. But 
here is perhaps the essential point: 
the remainder appears to be coextensive 
with the
entire architecture of non-totalizing 
thought. In its view there
is nothing that is everything; nothing 
is exhaustive, there is a
residue in every system—in cosmogony, 
food ritual, and even
sacrifice, which deposits, through 
ashes for instance, ambivalent
remains. A challenge to our 
mono-theistic and mono-logical
universes such a mode of thinking 
apparently needs the ambivalence of 
remainder if it is not to become 
enclosed within
One single-level symbolics, and thus 
always posit a non-object
as polluting as it is 
reviving—defilement and genesis. That is

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 77

why the poet of the Atharva Veda extols 
the defiling and regenerating remainder 
(uchista) as precondition for all form.
"Upon remainder the name and the form 
are founded, upon
remainder the world is founded . . . 
Being and non-being, both
are in the remainder, death, vigor."18
FEAR OF WOMEN—FEAR OF PROCREATION
Fear of the archaic mother turns out to 
be essentially fear of
her generative power. It is this power, 
a dreaded one, that
patrilineal filiation has the burden of 
subduing. It is thus not
surprising to see pollution rituals 
proliferating in societies where
patrilineal power is poorly secured, as 
if the latter sought, by
means of purification, a support 
against excessive matrilineality.
Thus, in a society where religious 
prohibitions correspond
to the sexual prohibitions intended to 
separate men from
women and insure the power of the 
former over the latter, it
has been possible to note—as with the 
Gidjingali in Australia—
the considerable sway of maternal 
authority over the sons. On
the other hand, with the neighboring 
Aranda, where paternal
control is much more important than 
with the Gidjingali, there
is no connection between sexual and 
religious prohibitions.19
The instance of the Nuer, analyzed by 
Evans Pritchard and
again by Mary Douglas, is very 
significant in that respect. It
involves a society that is dominated, 
at least among the aristocrats, by the 
agnatic principle and in which women 
are a
divisive factor; essential for 
reproduction, they nevertheless
endanger the ideal norms of the agnatic 
group, the more so as
cohabitation with maternal relatives 
seems common. Menstrual
pollution, as well as prohibition of 
incest with the mother,
considered the most dangerous of all, 
can be interpreted as the
symbolic equivalent of that conflict.20
A loathing of defilement as protection 
against the poorly
controlled power of mothers seems even 
clearer with the
Bemba. Ritually impure and 
contaminating, menstrual defilement 
wields with them, in addition, a 
cataclysmic power such
that one is led to speak, under the 
circumstances, not only of
ritual impurity but also of the 
power-of pollution. Thus, if a woman

78

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

undergoing her period touches fire (a 
masculine and patrilineal
symbol), food cooked on that fire makes 
her ill and threatens
her with death. Now, among the Bemba, 
power is in the hands
of men, but filiation is matrilineal 
and residence, after marriage,
is matrilocal. There is a great 
contradiction between male rule
and matrilocal residence; the young 
bridegroom is subjected to
the authority of the bride's family, 
and he must override it
through personal excellence during his 
maturity. He remains
nevertheless, because of 
matrilineality, in conflict with the 
maternal uncle who is the legal 
guardian of the children especially
when they are growing up.21 The power 
of pollution (the threat
of illness or death through the 
conjunction blood-fire) thus
transposes, on the symbolic level, the 
permanent conflict resulting from an 
unsettled separation between masculine 
and
feminine power at the level of social 
institutions. Non-separation would 
threaten the whole society with 
disintegration.
Here is a significant fact. Again as 
protection against the
generative power of women, pollution 
rites arise within societies that are 
afraid of overpopulation (in barren 
regions, for
instance). One thus finds them, as part 
of a whole system of
restraining procreation, along with 
incest taboo, etc., among
the Enga of New Guinea. On the other 
hand, with their Fore
neighbors, the desire to procreate, 
encouraged for opposite
ecological reasons, entails, one might 
say symmetrically, the
disappearance of incest taboo and 
pollution rites. Such a relaxation of 
prohibitions among the Fore, for the 
sake of a single
objective—reproduction at any cost—is 
accompanied by such
a lack of the "clean and proper" and 
hence of the "abject" that
cannibalism of the dead seems to be 
current practice. Contrariwise the 
Enga, heedful of pollution and 
subjected td fear of
procreation, are not acquainted with 
cannibalism.22
Is that parallel sufficient to suggest 
that defilement reveals,
at the same time as an attempt to 
throttle matrilineality, an
attempt at separating the speaking 
being from his body in order
that the latter accede to the status of 
clean and proper body,
that is to say, non-assimilable, 
uneatable, abject? It is only at
such a cost that the body is capable of 
being defended, protected—and also, 
eventually, sublimated. Fear of the 
uncon-

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 79

trollable generative mother repels me 
from the body; I give up
cannibalism because abjection (of the 
mother) leads me toward
respect for the body of the other, my 
fellow man, my brother.
DEFILEMENT AND ENDOGAMY IN INDIA
It is of course the hierarchic caste 
system in India that provides
the most complex and striking instance 
of a social, moral, and
religious system based on pollution and 
purification, on the
pure and the impure. It is worth 
confronting, as Louis Dumont
has done, this hierarchic system with 
the regulation of marriage.23 Dumont 
concludes that the endogamy in castes 
is only
a consequence of the initial hierarchic 
principle based on the
opposition pure/impure. Without going 
into the details of his
demonstration or into the numerous 
infractions to endogamy—
which are moreover inscribed naturally 
within the hierarchic
order, complicating it and 
strengthening it—I shall, for my
purpose, note the following.
The endogamic principle inherent in 
caste system amounts,
as everywhere else, to having the 
individual marry within his
group, or rather to his being 
prohibited from marrying outside
of it. Endogamy, in Indian castes, 
implies in addition a specific
filiation: the passing on of membership 
in the group by both
parents at the same time. The result of 
such a regulation is in fact
a balancing, symbolic and real, of the 
role of both sexes within
that socio-symbolic unit constituted by 
caste. The highly hierarchical nature 
of Indian society does not come into 
play between the sexes, at least not 
where filiation is concerned—a
major criterion of power in those 
societies. One could say that
caste is a hierarchic device that, in 
addition to professional 
specializations, insures, in the 
passing on of group membership,
an equal share to the father and to the 
mother.
Starting from there, the question as to 
whether the pure/
impure opposition determines the 
hierarchic order, or whether
caste endogamy is the initial 
principle, appears in a different
light. Let us put aside the debate over 
cause and effect, the
chicken and the egg. Let me note only 
that in an organization
like this one, without classic exogamy, 
social order is not elab-

80

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

orated on the basis of clear-cut 
oppositions represented by men
and women as tokens of "one's own" and 
the "foreign," the
"same" and the "different" (sex, group, 
clan, etc.). Nevertheless, as though 
making up for that lack of 
differentiation, meticulous rules of 
separation, rejection, and repulsion 
are introduced. Subjects and objects 
have only, on that basis, the status
of ab-jects for one another. In short, 
when one avoids the binarism of the 
exogamic system, that is, the 
father/mother, man/
woman strangeness at the level of the 
matrimonial institution,
then, at the ritual level, one 
multiplies abjections between the
sexes, between subjects and objects 
(essentially borderlanders,
a point to which I shall return), and 
between castes.
Beside that general rule, there are 
specific situations that confirm the 
impression that the strong caste 
hierarchy compensates
for the man/woman balance introduced by 
Indian endogamy.
Let me take note, among other matters, 
of the various forms
of marriage, often challenged and 
contradicted, that some have
been able to interpret as dual 
filiation, paternal and maternal.
Thus, for M. B. Emenau,24 there is in 
southern India a dual
unilineal descent, while for Louis 
Dumont the two unilineal
principles are found separately, even 
if paternal and maternal
traits can interfere in several ways 
within the same group.25 In
another connection, certain cases of 
hypergamy (the possibility
for the daughter to marry into a family 
superior to her own
without affecting the status of her 
children or excluding endogamy), while 
they may amount to a promotion for the
woman, are valid only for her, since 
the marriage is of no
account for the husband. That very 
particular search for a father
having a higher status is interpreted 
as maintaining "matrihneal
filiation in a patrilineal 
environment."26
Ethnologists could multiply and specify 
examples. The conclusion that I shall 
draw is as follows. If any organization 
is
necessarily made up of differences, 
separations, and oppositions, the caste 
system, by reason of the endogamy that 
goes
with it and the balance between the two 
sexes that the latter
institutionalizes, seems to translate a 
difference elsewhere by
multiplying it; that difference, in 
exogamic societies, is one and
acts fundamentally between the two 
sexes as representatives and

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 81

the two entities that are territorial, 
economic, political, ethnic,
etc.
It is as if the more the balance 
between the two sexual powers
was maintained by endogamy, the greater 
was the need to have
other differences come into play. That 
inseparability, one might
even say that immanence to endogamy, of 
the hierarchic principle, like the 
cloth and lining of a single 
organization, perhaps
explains why marriage (the rite of 
joining, of maintaining the
identity and balance of the two) is the 
only rite of passage that
"is not accompanied by any impurity."27 
It gives the Hindu the
impression that he is "symbolically and 
temporarily raised from
his condition (which is hierarchical, 
governed by the pure/impure) and 
assimilated to the highest, that of 
prince or Brahman
for a non-Brahman, god for a 
Brahman."28 Everywhere else
the principle of separation holds sway, 
one that Bougie likens
to a repulsion.
MARRIAGE OR LOATHING?
Dumont's distrust for Bougie's term and 
the logic that it conveys, the 
preference he gives to the hierarchical 
principle, do
not appear to invalidate my reasoning. 
I shall simply conclude
that the hierarchic principle is 
jointly based on two logical 
principles—the separation exemplified 
by the dichotomy of the pure
and the impure, and the maintaining of 
a balance between the two
sexes through endogamy.
As I have pointed out, it is Celestin 
Bougie who has evoked,
along with the socio-logical principle 
ruling the caste system
("hierarchy, hereditary 
specialization"30), the one he calls 
"repulsion"31 or "loathing";32 a 
principle that seems more psychological 
but is in fact linked to the logic of 
the sacred. Particularly, he dwells on 
the question of "food loathing": is 
caste
a "matter of marriage" or a "matter of 
meals"? Skirting the
psychological or psychoanalytical 
archeology of repulsion, this
controversial anthropologist seeks its 
anchorage in family organization on the 
one hand, in the economy of sacrifice 
on the
other. As to family organization, he 
restricts himself to references to "far 
away memories of earliest family 
practices" or to

82

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

"relics of family religion" (as opposed 
to the demands of industry); these 
would account for the traits that cause 
guild system to resemble caste 
system.33 The notion of repulsion is 
studied neither by Dumont nor by 
Bougie, even when Bougie
mentions it in connection with Brahmans 
and has it spring from
the taboo that surrounds sacrifice in 
any society, and which India
"merely carried to its highest power." 
He mentions that the
sacrificer is surrounded by taboos 
because he channels "from
the profane world to the sacred world 
fluid, ambiguous forces,
that are at the same time the most 
dangerous and the most
beneficial of all."34
HIERARCHY AND NONVIOLENCE
If, on the other hand, one 
reestablishes Bougie's outlook in the
light of the precise details given by 
Dumont, one no longer sees
the pure/impure opposition that governs 
Indian hierarchic order
as merely encompassing; one also sees 
it as correlative of marriage rules and 
religious customs (sacrifices and their 
evolution).
One is then led to conceive of the 
opposition between pure and
impure not as an archetype but as one 
coding of the differentiation of the 
speaking subject as such, a coding of 
his repulsion
in relation to the other in order to 
autonomize himself. The
pure/impure opposition represents (when 
it does not function
as metaphor) /the striving for 
identity, a difference. It appears
instead of sexual difference (and in 
that sense it may seem, as in
caste system, parallel to the 
institutionalizing of bisexuality
through endogamic marriage). On that 
basis, it acts as a separating value 
peculiar to the symbolic function 
itself (sacrificer/
sacrifice/God; subject/thing/meaning). 
The hierarchy founded
on the pure and the impure displaces 
(or denies) the difference
between the sexes; it replaces the 
violence of sacrifice with the ritual
of purification.
In the final analysis, the pure/impure 
opposition would not
be a datum in itself but would stem 
from the necessity for the
speaking being to be confronted with 
sexual difference and the
symbolic. The Indian caste system would 
allow that confrontation to take place 
smoothly. It would manage it without 
being

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 83

pre-emptive—in the manner of 
monotheism, for instance—and
with the greatest of care, protecting 
the subject who, from
abjection to abjection, is confronted 
with them systematically.
The cost is social immobility and an 
identification of that which
is elsewhere autonomous subjectivity 
with the rules of abjection
that pattern the socio-symbolic 
territory. Hierarchy is indeed
constitutive of Hindu man (and perhaps 
of any speaking being
if he does not erase his participation 
in the symbolic), but it is
rooted in two prime shifts: the sign 
(solemnized by sacrifice),
sexual difference (regulated by 
marriage). If it be true that the
pure/impure opposition takes in the 
area that, with us, is governed by the 
good/evil opposition, the boundary at 
issue is
related, through the hierarchy of caste 
and matrimonial regulations that 
accompany and secure it, to a very deep 
logic of
the speaking being as separated by sex 
and language. India has
the incomparable advantage of laying 
bare the ab-ject logic of
that separation and resolving in its 
nonviolent fashion the
asymptotic relation between sexuality 
and symbolism, balancing differences 
where sexuality is concerned, 
multiplying and
grading divisions to the utmost in the 
case of symbolism.
OEDIPUS THE KING OR INVISIBLE ABJECTION
The tragic and sublime fate of Oedipus 
sums up and displaces
the mythical defilement that situates 
impurity on the untouchable "other 
side" constituted by the other sex, 
within the corporeal border—the thin 
sheet of desire—and, basically, within
the mother woman—the myth of natural 
fullness. To be convinced of this, we 
would have to follow Sophocles' Oedipus 
the
King and above all his Oedipus at 
Colonus.
A sovereign on account of his knowing 
how to unveil logical
enigmas, Oedipus the king is 
nonetheless ignorant of his desire,
He does not know that he is also the 
one who kills his father
Laius and marries his mother Jocasta. 
Had they remained veiled,
that murder as much as that desire 
would onlybe the obverse,
quite obviously solidary, of his 
logical and consequently political 
power. Abjection breaks out only when, 
driven to distraction by a desire to 
know, Oedipus discovers desire and death

84 FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

in his sovereign being; when he assigns 
them to the same, full,
knowing, and responsible sovereignty. 
In Oedipus the King the
solution remains nonetheless wholly 
mythical; it proceeds by
means of exclusion, as we have seen it 
at work in the logic of
other mythical and ritual systems.
There is, first of all, a spatial 
exclusion. Oedipus must exile
himself, leave the proper place of his 
sovereignty, thrust defilement aside so 
that the boundaries of the social 
contract may
be perpetuated at Thebes.
At the same time, there is an exclusion 
from sight. Oedipus
blinds himself, so as not to have to 
suffer the sight of the objects
of his desire and murder (the faces of 
his wife, mother, and
children). If it be true that such 
blinding is equivalent to castration, 
it is neither eviration nor death. In 
relation to them,
it is a symbolic substitute intended 
for building the wall, reinforcing the 
boundary that wards off opprobrium, 
which, because of this very fact, is 
not disavowed but shown to be alien.
Blinding is thus an image of splitting; 
it marks, on the very
body, the alteration of the self and 
clean into the defiled—the
scar taking the place of a revealed and 
yet invisible abjection.
Of abjection considered as invisible. 
In return for which citystate and 
knowledge can endure.
PHARMAKOS THE AMBIGUOUS
Let us emphasize again the tragic 
development of Oedipus the
King: does it not sum up the mythic 
variant of abjection? Entering an 
impure city—a miasma—he turns himself 
into agos,
defilement, in order to purify it and 
to become katharmos. He
is thus a purifier by the very fact of 
being agos. His abjection
is due to the permanent ambiguity of 
the parts he plays without
his knowledge, even when he believes he 
knows.35 It is precisely
such a dynamics of reversals that makes 
of him a being of
abjection and a pharmakos, a scapegoat 
who, having been
ejected, allows the city to be freed 
from defilement. The
mainspring of the tragedy lies in that 
ambiguity;36 prohibition
and ideal are joined in a single 
character in order to signify that
the speaking being has no space of his 
own but stands on a

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

fragile threshold as if stranded on 
account of an impossible
demarcation. If such is the logic of 
Oedipus as pharmakos katharmos, there 
is no alternative but to note that 
Sophocles' play
derives its effectiveness not only from 
that mathesis of ambiguity but also 
from the wholly semantic values it 
endows opposing terms with. But what 
"values"?
Thebes is a miasma on account of 
sterility, disease, and death.
Oedipus is agos on account of his 
having, through murder of
the father and incest with the mother, 
interrupted the reproductive chain. 
Defilement is the stopping of life; 
(like) sexuality
without reproduction (the sons born out 
of Oedipus' incest will
perish, while his daughter will survive 
only within another
logic, that of the contract or symbolic 
existence, as will be seen
in Oedipus at Colonus). A certain 
sexuality, which does not have
in Greek tragedy the meaning it has for 
modern man, which
does not even adorn itself with 
pleasure but with sovereignty
and knowledge, is the equivalent of 
disease and death. Defilement
blends into it: practically, it amounts 
to tampering with the
mother. Defilement is incest considered 
as transgression of the
boundaries of what is clean and proper.
Where then lies the border, the initial 
phantasmatic limit that
establishes the clean and proper self 
of the speaking and/or social
being? Between man and woman? Or 
between mother and
child? Perhaps between woman and 
mother? The replica of
Oedipus-pharmakos on the woman's side 
is Jocasta; she is herself
Janus-like, ambiguity and reversal in a 
single being, a single
part, a single function. Janus-like 
perhaps as any woman is, to
the extent that any woman is at the 
same time a desiring being,
that is, a speaking being, and a 
reproductive being, that is, one
that separates itself from its child. 
Oedipus has perhaps done
nothing more than marrying the 
splitting of Jocasta—the mystery, the 
enigma of femininity. At the limit, if 
someone personifies abjection without 
assurance of purification, it is a
woman, "any woman," the "woman as a 
whole"; as far as he
is concerned, man exposes abjection by 
knowing it, and
through that very act purifies it. 
Jocasta is miasma and agos—
that goes without saying. But Oedipus 
alone is pharmakos. He
knows and bounds the mythic universe 
constituted by the ques-

85

86 FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

tion of (sexual) difference and 
preoccupied with the separation
of the two powers: 
reproduction/production, 
feminine/masculine. Oedipus completes 
that universe by introducing it into
the particularity of each individual 
who then unfailingly becomes pharmakos 
and universally tragic.
But for such interiorization to take 
place, a transition was
needed; from Thebes to Colonus, 
ambiguity and reversal of
differences become contract.
PURIFICATION AT COLONUS
Oedipus at Colonus is therefore 
completely other. The locale has
changed. And while divine laws have not 
lost their harshness,
Oedipus, for his part, has modified his 
stance with respect to
them. In point of fact, a 
transformation of political laws 
actually
took place between the writing of the 
two plays. Between 420
(Oedipus the King) and 402, when 
Oedipus at Colonus was first
performed (after Sophocles' death in 
406-405), there was a transition from 
tyranny to democracy. But if in the 
work of Sophocles' old age the 
democratic principle appears to hold 
sway,
that is perhaps only one of the reasons 
that explain such a change
with respect to divine laws in the 
dynamics of Oedipus at Colonus. In 
opposition to the sovereign Oedipus, 
overcome, destroyed, shattered through 
and within opprobrium, we have
here an Oedipus who is not king, in 
other words an Oedipus
who is a subject, who proclaims his 
innocence. Not without
hesitations. Having first thought of 
shaking Theseus' hand and
embracing him, he comes to think that 
he is impure although
irresponsible:
But what am I saying? Unhappy as I have 
become, how could I wish
thee to touch one with whom all stain 
of sin hath made its dwelling?
No, not I, nor allow thee, if thou 
wouldst. (lines 1134 ff.)
And yet he had cried out at the very 
beginning of that closing
in of his fate:
• • ■ mine acts, at least, have been in 
suffering rather than doing (1.
268)

stainless before the law, void of 
malice have I come unto this pass!
(1- 348)37

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 87

Let us stop with this acknowledgment. 
Neither a confession
of guilt nor an entreaty of innocence 
consequent to the suffering
that was undergone, that statement 
marks the slipping from
Oedipus the king to Oedipus the 
subject. "I am innocent before
the Law" signifies first, / do not know 
the Law, the one who solves
logical enigmas does not know the Law, 
and that means, I who
knows am not the Law. Thus a first 
estrangement is introduced
between knowledge and Law, one that 
unbalances the sovereign. If the Law is 
in the Other, my fate is neither power 
nor
desire, it is the fate of an estranged 
person: my fate is death.
The abjection of Oedipus the king was 
the irreconcilable in
knowledge and desire, both all-powerful 
in man's being.
The abjection of Oedipus at Colonus is 
the not known of the
speaking being who is subject to death 
at the same time as to
symbolic union.
For it is on the threshold of death, 
while he is making a pact
with a foreigner, that Oedipus says he 
does not know the Law.
Exile, first desired, then refused by 
his sons, has become rejection
before being transformed, for Oedipus, 
into choice and symbolic
handing down. For it is on foreign 
soil, and to a foreign hero,
Theseus, a symbolic son, that he 
bequeaths, at the same time
as his daughters, the secret of his 
death. A death that, also in
and of itself, without being in any way 
expiatory or redeeming
for Oedipus, is meant for the benefit 
of others, of foreigners—
Theseus and the Atheneans.
Within such a context, it is Ismene, 
the daughter so often
silent but who speaks in order to 
object to the very Oedipean
quarrels of the sons, who also heralds 
his salvation through the
gods: "Yea, for the gods lift thee now, 
but before they were
working thy ruin" (1. 390). Such a 
lifting will be explained by
the innocence of Oedipus before the Law 
(1. 548); but to make
it concrete, he will undergo the 
purification rites at Colonus
(11. 466-491), rites that provide us 
with one of the most detailed
descriptions of purification in 
classical literature.
A CHALLENGE TO ABJECTION: THE SYMBOLIC 
PACT
At Colonus, therefore, the fate of 
abjection was changed. Neither excluded 
nor blindly other, it finds its place 
as his not known

88 FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT

within a "subject on the verge of 
death." Abjection is nothing
more than a flaw in Oedipus' impossible 
sovereignty, a flaw
in his knowledge. If rituals are called 
upon to purify it, it is
nevertheless in the sayings of Oedipus 
concerning divine Law
as well as Theseus that it is assumed. 
It has nothing to do with
confessing a sin; abjection, in a 
Greece in the process of becoming 
democratic, is taken over by the one 
who, through
speaking, recognizes himself as mortal 
(so much so that he
leaves no male issue) and subject to 
the symbolic (one will note
the purely nominal handing down of his 
mortal jouissance to
the foreigner, Theseus).
A bridge has been built toward another 
logic of abjection:
it is no longer defilement to be 
excluded ritually as the other
facet of the sacred (social, cultural, 
one's own) but transgression
due to a misreading of the Law.
Oedipus the King handed over to Freud 
and his posterity the
strength of (incestuous) desire and the 
desire for (the father's)
death. However abject these desires may 
be, which threaten the
integrity of individual and society, 
they are nonetheless sovereign. Such is 
the blinding light cast by Freud, 
following Oedipus, on abjection, as he 
invites us to recognize ourselves in it
without gouging out our eyes.
But after all, what saves us from 
performing that decisive
gesture? The answer can perhaps be 
found in Oedipus at Colonus,
and yet that play does not seem to have 
preoccupied Freud.
The border between abjection and the 
sacred, between desire
and knowledge, between death and 
society, can be faced
squarely, uttered without sham 
innocence or modest self-effacement, 
provided one sees in it an incidence of 
man's particularity as mortal and 
speaking. "There is an abject" is 
henceforth
stated as, "I am abject, that is, 
mortal and speaking." Incompleteness 
and dependency on the Other, far from 
clearing a
desiring and murderous Oedipus, allow 
him only to make his
dramatic splitting 
transmittable—transmittable to a foreign
hero, and hence opening up the 
undecidable possibility of a few
truth-effects. Our eyes can remain open 
provided we recognize
ourselves as always already altered by 
the symbolic—by language. Provided we 
hear in language—and not in the other,

FROM FILTH TO DEFILEMENT 89

nor in the other sex—the gouged-out 
eye, the wound, the basic
incompleteness that conditions the 
indefinite quest of signifying
concatenations. That amounts to joying 
in the truth of selfdivision 
(abjection/sacred). Here two paths open 
out: sublimation and perversion.
And their intersection: religion.
Freud did not need to go to Colonus for 
that. He had Moses,
who preceded him in this reversal of 
defilement in subjection
to symbolic law. But it may be that 
Oedipus at Colonus shows,
in addition to other modifications of 
Greek culture, the path
by which Hellenism could meet with the 
Bible.

THE BIBLICAL NEUTRALIZATION OF 
DEFILEMENT
Interpretations of biblical impurity 
are, roughly speaking, divided along 
two lines of persuasion. The first, 
following up on
the ideas of W. Robertson Smith (The 
Religion of the Semites,
1889), considers biblical impurity as a 
condition internal to Jewish 
monotheism, intrinsically dependent on 
divine will, since
the impure is what departs from divine 
precepts. Far from being
a demonic force alien to divinity, 
impurity would then be a
kind of neutralization of taboos 
(peculiar to rites of defilement),
owing to the fact that it is 
subordinate to the will of God.1 The
other interpretation, represented by 
Baruch A. Levine,2 considers impurity 
to be indicative of a demonic force, 
threatening
the divinity, acting independently of 
it and analogous to the
autonomous power of a spirit of evil.
I shall try to demonstrate that those 
two contrary positions,
in fact, do no more than unilaterally 
emphasize the complex
dynamics of biblical thought concerning 
impurity. As I see it,
biblical impurity is permeated with the 
tradition of defilement;

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

91

in that sense, it points to but does 
not signify an autonomous
force that can be threatening for 
divine agency. I shall suggest
that such a force is rooted, 
historically (in the history of 
religions) and subjectively (in the 
structuration of the subject's
identity), in the cathexis of maternal 
function—mother, women,
reproduction. But the biblical test—and 
therein lies its extraordinary 
specificity—performs the tremendous 
forcing that consists in subordinating 
maternal power (whether historical or
phantasmatic, natural or reproductive) 
to symbolic order as
pure logical order regulating social 
performance, as divine Law
attended to in the Temple. To the 
extent that the Temple is the
Law, one is biblically pure or impure 
only with respect to social
order, that is, with respect to the Law 
or the cult (as Neusner
would have it). If, on the other hand, 
one tries to go back
further into the archeology of that 
impurity, one indeed encounters fear in 
the face of a power (maternal? 
natural?—at any
rate insubordinate and not liable of 
being subordinated to Law)
that might become autonomous evil but 
is not, so long as the
hold of subjective and social symbolic 
order endures. Biblical
impurity is thus always already a 
logicizing of what departs from
the symbolic, and for that very reason 
it prevents it from being
actualized as demonic evil. Such a 
logicizing inscribes the demonic in a 
more abstract and also more moral 
register as a potential for guilt and 
sin.
Purity or impurity are thus situated in 
relation to cult because
the latter represents or serves a logic 
of distribution and behavior
on which the symbolic community is 
founded: a Law, a reason.
That is what Maimonides says, within a 
definition of impurity
that gives considerable weight not only 
to reason but also to
the subject's initiative:
. . . one who sets his heart on 
cleansing himself from the uncleannesses
that beset men's souls . . . becomes 
clean as soon as he consents in
his heart to shun those counsels and 
brings his soul into the waters
of pure reason.3
When Mary Douglas defines impurity as 
that which departs
from symbolic order and Neusner sees in 
it what is incompatible
with the Temple, they are talking about 
the same thing according

92

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

to two points of view. The 
anthropologist must discover social
order while studying societies that 
observe it unconsciously,
while the historian of religions stands 
before that order, which
is not only exhibited but isolated in 
itself and celebrated as an
agency of the Law by that colossal 
revolution—Hebraic
monotheism.
But the question for the 
analyst-semiologist is to know how
far one can analyze ritual impurity. 
The historian of religions
stops soon: the cultically impure is 
that which is based on a
natural "loathing."4 The anthropologist 
goes further: there is
nothing "loathsome" in itself; the 
loathsome is that which disobeys 
classification rules peculiar to the 
given symbolic system.5
But as far as I am concerned, I keep 
asking questions. Why that
system of classification and not 
another? What social, subjective,
and socio-subjectively interacting 
needs does it fulfill? Are there
no subjective structurations that, 
within the organization of
each speaking being, correspond to this 
or that symbolic-social
system and represent, if not stages, at 
least types of subjectivity
and society? Types that would be 
defined, in the last analysis,
according to the subject's position in 
language, that is, by the
more or less partial use he can make of 
his potentialities?
A STRATEGY OF IDENTITY
The pure/impure distinction, 
tahor/tame, shows up in the biblical 
episode of Noah's burnt offerings to 
the Lord after the
flood. "And Noah builded an altar unto 
the Lord; and took of
every clean beast, and of every clean 
fowl, and offered burnt
offerings on the altar."6 That 
recognition of the pure/impure
difference apparently forces the Lord 
to defer his judgment—
and that entails clemency on the one 
hand, time on the other.
I will not again curse the ground any 
more for men's sake; for the
imagination of man's heart is evil from 
his youth; neither will I again
smite any more every thing living, as I 
have done.
While the earth remaineth, seedtime and 
harvest, and cold and heat,
and summer and winter, and day and 
night shall not cease.7
Neither Cain, although at fault, nor 
Adam, although wandering (nad, and that 
brings him close to feminine impurity,

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION 93

niddah), are defiled. Tahor/tame8 seems 
to be a specific relation
that pertains to setting in order, 
dependent on a covenant with
God. That opposition, even though it is 
not absolute, is inscribed in the 
biblical text's basic concern with 
separating, with
constituting strict identities without 
intermixture. The distance
between man and God will be at issue in 
the elaboration of the
theological corpus. One can observe, 
however, along the complex course 
followed by Yahwist and Elohist, how 
that fundamental difference in fact 
subsumes the others—life and death,
vegetal and animal, flesh and blood, 
hale and ill, otherness and
incest. Keeping to the semantic value 
of those oppositions, one
can group them under three major 
categories of abomination:
i) food taboos; 2) corporeal alteration 
and its climax, death;
and 3) the feminine body and incest. 
Topologically speaking
such variants correspond to one's being 
allowed to have access
or not to a place—the holy place of the 
Temple. Logically,
conformity to the Law is involved, the 
Law of purity [cleanliness] or Law of 
holiness, particularly as it is summed 
up in
Leviticus 11-16 and 19-26.
"MATERIAL" OR "ALLEGORICAL" OPPOSITIONS
Commentators have noted that if 
biblical impurity is from the
outset tied to the religious cult since 
the impure is that which
is excluded from the Temple, it deals 
with matter (food, menses, leprosy, 
gonorrhea, etc.) having no immediate 
relation to
the sacred place. It is thus in 
secondary fashion, through a
metaphor, that impurity concerns the 
relation to the Temple,
just as, consequently, what is excluded 
from it—idolatry in
particular. Although the pure/impure 
distinction was already
posited earlier, and especially with 
Isaiah (36-66), it is in fact
only at the time of the second Temple, 
after the return from
exile, after Ezekiel, that it becomes 
fundamental for the religious
life of Israel. Nevertheless, and 
without for that matter
undergoing any great change, it now 
appears even more allegorical or 
metaphorical, for henceforth there is 
less stress on
the cultic center of purity than on 
impurity, which has become
a metaphor for idolatry, sexuality, and 
immorality.9

. 94

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

It would thus seem that even when the 
Temple was destroyed, the Temple's 
function remained as far as the Jews 
were
concerned, and it organized, in 
"metaphorical" fashion—but
what does that mean?—a number of 
oppositions. I shall try to
demonstrate that there is no opposition 
between material abomination and 
topo-logical (holy place of the Temple) 
or logical
(holy Law) reference. The one and the 
other are two aspects,
semantic and logical, of the imposition 
of a strategy of identity,
which is, in all strictness, that of 
monotheism. The semes that
clothe the process of separation 
(orality, death, incest) are the
inseparable lining of its logical 
representation aiming to guarantee the 
place and law of the One God. In other 
words, the
place and law of the One do not exist 
without a series of separations
that are oral, corporeal, or even more 
generally material, and
in the last analysis relating to fusion 
with the mother/The pure/
impure mechanism testifies to the harsh 
combat Judaism, in
order to constitute itself, must wage 
against paganism and its
maternal cults. It carries into the 
private lives of everyone the
brunt of the struggle each subject must 
wage during the entire
length of his personal history in order 
to become separate, that
is to say, to become a speaking subject 
and/or subject to Law.
In this sense I shall posit that the 
"material" semes of the pure/
impure opposition that mark out the 
biblical text are not metaphors of the 
divine prohibition resuming archaic, 
material customs, but are responses of 
symbolic Law, in the sphere of
subjective economy and the genesis of 
speaking identity.
As the introduction of the pure/impure 
opposition coincides,
as we have seen, with burnt offerings, 
this sets up at once the
problem of the relations between taboo 
and sacrifice. It would
seem as though God had penalized by 
means of the flood a
breach of the order regulated by taboo. 
The burnt offering set
up by Noah must then reestablish the 
order disturbed by the
breaking of taboo. Two complementary 
motions are thus
involved.
TABOO FORESTALLS SACRIFICE
The taboo implied by the pure/impure 
distinction organizes
differences, shaping and opening an 
articulation that we must

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION 95

indeed call metonymic, within which, if 
he maintains himself
there, man has a share in the sacred 
order. As to sacrifice, it
constitutes the alliance with the One 
when the metonymic order
that stems from it is perturbed. 
Sacrifice thus operates between
two heterogeneous, incompatible, 
forever irreconcilable terms.
It connects them necessarily in violent 
fashion, violating at the
same time as it posits it the semantic 
isotopy of each. Sacrifice
is thus a metaphor. The question has 
been raised as to which
came first, metonymic taboo or 
metaphoric sacrifice.10 All
things considered, as sacrifice merely 
extends the logic of taboo
when the latter is perturbed, the 
anteriority of taboo over sacrifice has 
been asserted. It seems to me more 
tenable to say that
some collections of religious texts, by 
stressing taboo, seek
protection from sacrificial 
interference or at least subordinate
the latter to the former. Biblical 
abomination would thus be
an attempt to throttle murder. Through 
sustained abomination,
Judaism parts ways with sacrificial 
religions. And to the extent
that religion and sacrifice overlap, 
biblical abominations perhaps
constitute the logical explicitation of 
the religious (without proceeding to 
murderous acts—which become unnecessary 
when
the rules of taboo are disclosed and 
observed). With biblical
abomination religion is probably 
wending its way toward
fulfillment.
THE MAN/GOD DISTINCTION: A DIETARY 
DISTINCTION
From its very beginning, the biblical 
text insists on maintaining
the distance between man and God by 
means of a dietary differentiation. 
Thus the Lord (Genesis 3:22), after 
noting that
"man is become as one of us, to know 
good and evil," decides
to prevent this pretentious "scholar" 
from also becoming immortal. He thus 
prohibits certain foods by banishing 
him from
the garden of Eden, "lest he put forth 
his hand, and take also
from the tree of life, and eat, and 
live for ever." If a certain
kind of eating, that of the apple of 
knowledge,'could not have
been held back from Adam, who was 
tempted by Eve, herself
tempted by the Serpent, another food 
will be absolutely banned,
in order to forestall the chaos that 
would result from the identification of 
man with the immortality of God. One 
should note

96 SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

that it is a feminine and animal 
temptation that is concealed
under the first dietary trespass; for 
we shall encounter the reference to 
woman only fortuitously in the later 
abominations
of the Levites.
Thus, as J. Soler points out,11 food 
effects an initial division
between man and God; to God belong 
living beings (by way
of sacrifice), to man vegetable foods. 
For, "Thou shalt not kill."
In order to understand, after that 
first dietary apportionment,
the introduction of meat diet, one must 
assume a cataclysm—
for instance, a violation of divine 
rule and subsequent punishment. It is 
indeed only after the Flood that 
authorization is granted
to eat "every moving thing that liveth" 
(Genesis 9:3). Far from
being a reward, such permission is 
accompanied by an acknowledgment of 
essential evil, and it includes a 
negative,
incriminating connotation with respect 
to man: "For the imagination of man's 
heart is evil" (Genesis 8:21). As if 
there had
been an acknowledgment of a bent toward 
murder essential to
human beings and the authorization for 
a meat diet was the
recognition of that ineradicable "death 
drive," seen here under
its most primordial or archaic 
aspect—devouring.
And yet, the biblical concern with 
separating and ordering
encounters further on the supposedly 
previous distinction between vegetable 
and animal. In the postdiluvian 
situation such
a distinction is brought out again 
under the guise of the flesh/
blood opposition. On the one hand there 
is bloodless flesh
(destined for man) and on the other, 
blood (destined for God).
Blood, indicating the impure, takes on 
the "animal" seme of
the previous opposition and inherits 
the propensity for murder
of which man must cleanse himself. But 
blood, as a vital element, also refers 
to women, fertility, and the assurance 
of fecundation. It thus becomes a 
fascinating semantic crossroads,
the propitious place for abjection 
where death and femininity,
murder and procreation, cessation of 
life and vitality all come together. 
"But flesh with the life thereof, which 
is the blood
thereof, shall ye not eat" (Genesis 
9:4).
Such is the Elohistic covenant agreed 
upon with Noah for
the whole of mankind. The Yahwist, 
setting up the agreement
between Moses and God, valid for a 
single nation, applies him-

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION 97

self to making that system of 
differences both more rigorous
and more precise. "I am the Lord your 
God, which have separated you from 
other people. Ye shall therefore put 
difference
between clean beasts and unclean ..." 
(Leviticus 20:24-25).
The dietary domain will then continue 
to be the privileged
object of divine taboos, but it will be 
modified, amplified, and
even seem to become identified with the 
most moral, if not the
most abstract, statements of the Law. 
We shall attempt to trace
that evolution in chapters 11 to 18 in 
Leviticus.

LEVITICUS: A PURITY OF PLACE, A PURITY 
OF SPEECH
Dietary instructions crop up after the 
burnt offering presented
by Moses and Aaron to the Lord Yahweh 
(as they do after
Noah's burnt offering to the Lord 
Elohim). Two officiants at
the sacrifice, having "offered strange 
fire" to the Lord Yahweh,
become "devoured" by the sacred fire 
(Leviticus, 10:1-2). At
that moment, a communication from the 
Lord seems to indicate
that the sacrifice "in itself cannot 
assume the status of a divine
covenant, unless that sacrifice is 
already inscribed in a logic of
the pure/impure distinction, which it 
would consolidate and
enable one to hand down.
Do not drink wine nor strong drink, 
thou, nor thy sons with thee,
when ye go into the tabernacle of the 
congregation, lest ye die: it shall
be a statute for ever throughout your 
generations:
And that ye may put difference between 
holy and unholy, and
between unclean and clean;
And that ye may teach the children of 
Israel all the statutes which
the Lord hath spoken into them by the 
hand of Moses. (Leviticus
10:9-11)

The sacrifice has efficacy then only 
when manifesting a logic
of separation, distinction, and 
difference that is governed by
admissibility to the holy place, that 
is, the appointed place for
encountering the sacred fire of the 
Lord Yahweh.
A spatial reference is thus called 
forth, in a first stage, as
criterion of purity, provided that the 
blood of the expiational
goat not be brought in (Leviticus 
1o:18). But such prerequisites

98

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

for purity (holy space, no blood) seem 
to have been deemed
insufficient, for the following chapter 
modifies them. The pure
will no longer be what is restricted to 
a place but what accords
with a speech; the impure will not only 
be a fascinating element
(connoting murder and life: blood) but 
any infraction to a logical
conformity. Thus,
And the Lord spake unto Moses and to 
Aaron, saying unto them,
Speak unto the children of Israel, 
saying, These are the beasts which
ye shall eat among all the beasts that 
are on the earth.
Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is 
clovenfooted, and cheweth the
cud, among the beasts, that ye shall 
eat.
Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of 
them that chew the cud, or
of them that divide the hoof: as the 
camel, because he cheweth the
cud, but divided not the hoof; he is 
unclean unto you. (Leviticus
11:1-4)

And so forth.
The list of the occasionally specious 
prohibitions that make
up this chapter becomes clear when it 
is understood that there
is a strict intent of establishing 
conformity with the logic of the
divine word. Now such a logic is 
founded on the initial biblical
postulate of the man/God difference, 
which is coextensive with
the prohibition of murder. As J. Soler 
has shown,12 what is
involved, as in Deuteronomy 14, is the 
establishment of a logical
field preventing man from eating 
carnivorous animals. One needs
to preserve oneself from murder, not 
incorporate carnivorous
or rapacious animals, and there is only 
one prescription for that:
eating herbivorous, cud-chewing 
animals. There are ruminants
that do not follow the general rule as 
to hoofs, and they will
be thrust aside. The pure will be that 
which conforms to an
established taxonomy; the impure, that 
which unsettles it, establishes 
intermixture and disorder. The example 
offish, birds,
and insects, normally linked to one of 
three elements (sea,
heaven, earth), is very significant 
from that point of view; the
impure will be those that do not 
confine themselves to one
element but point to admixture and 
confusion.
Thus, what initially appeared to us as 
a basic opposition between man and God 
(vegetable/animal, flesh/blood), 
following

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION 99

upon the initial contract, "Thou shalt 
not kill," becomes a complete system of 
logical oppositions. Differing from 
burnt offerings, this system of 
abomination presupposes it and 
guarantees its efficacy. Semantically 
controlled, initially at least, by
the life/death dichotomy, it becomes in 
course of time a code
of differences and observance of it. It 
goes without saying that
the pragmatic value of those 
differences (the function of this
or that animal in everyday life 
possibly affecting the pure/impure 
designation), like their sexual 
connotations (I shall return
to this point), does not detract from 
the remarkable fact of
having a system of taboos constituted 
like a true formal system—a taxonomy. 
Mary Douglas brilliantly emphasized the
logical conformity of Levitical 
abominations, which, without
a design of "separation" and 
"individual integrity," would be
incomprehensible.
FOOD AND THE FEMININE
A brief and very important chapter of 
Leviticus, chapter 12, is
inserted between those dietary 
prohibitions and the expansion
of their logic to other domains of 
existence. Between the theme
of food and that of the sick body 
(Leviticus 13-14), the text
will deal with the woman in childbed. 
Because of her parturition
and the blood that goes with it, she 
will be "impure": "according
to the days of the separation for her 
infirmity shall she be
unclean" (Leviticus 12:2). If she gives 
birth to a daughter, the
girl "shall be unclean two weeks, as in 
her separation" (Leviticus
12:5). To purify herself, the mother 
must provide a burnt offering and a sin 
offering. Thus, on her part, there is 
impurity,
defilement, blood, and purifying 
sacrifice. On the other hand,
if she gives birth to a male, "the 
flesh of his foreskin shall be
circumcised" (Leviticus 12:3). 
Circumcision would thus separate one 
from maternal, feminine impurity and 
defilement; it
stands instead of sacrifice, meaning 
not only that it replaces it
but is its equivalent—a sign of the 
alliance with God. Circumcision can be 
said to find its place in the same 
series as food
taboos; it indicates a separation and 
at the same time does away
with the need for sacrifice, of which 
it nevertheless bears the

IOO SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

trace. Such a comment on circumcision 
within a text on feminine and 
particularly maternal impurity, 
illuminates the rite in
fundamental fashion. I agree that it 
concerns an alliance with
the God of the chosen people; but what 
the male is separated
from, the other that circumcision 
carves out on his very sex,
is the other sex, impure, defiled. By 
repeating the natural scar
of the umbilical cord at the location 
of sex, by duplicating and
thus displacing through ritual the 
preeminent separation, which
is that from the mother, Judaism seems 
to insist in symbolic
fashion—the very opposite of what is 
"natural"—that the identity of the 
speaking being (with his God) is based 
on the separation of the son from the 
mother. Symbolic identity presupposes 
the violent difference of the sexes.
Let me take a further step. The terms, 
impurity and defilement, that Leviticus 
heretofore had tied to food that did not
conform to the taxonomy of sacred Law, 
are now attributed
to the mother and to women in general. 
Dietary abomination
has thus a parallel—unless it be a 
foundation—in the abomination provoked 
by the fertilizable or fertile feminine 
body
(menses, childbirth). Might it be that 
dietary prohibitions are
a screen in a still more radical 
separating process? Would the
dispositions place-body and the more 
elaborate one speech-logic
of differences be an attempt to keep a 
being who speaks to his
God separated from the fecund mother? 
In that case, it would
be a matter of separating oneself from 
the phantasmatic power
of the mother, that archaic Mother 
Goddess who actually
haunted the imagination of a nation at 
war with the surrounding
polytheism. A phantasmatic mother who 
also constitutes, in
the specific history of each person, 
the abyss that must be established as 
an autonomous (and not encroaching) 
place and
distinct object, meaning a signifiable 
one, so that such a person
might learn to speak. At any rate, that 
evocation of defiled
maternality, in Leviticus 12, inscribes 
the logic of dietary abominations 
within that of a limit, a boundary, a 
border between
the sexes, a separation between 
feminine and masculine as foundation 
for the organization that is "clean and 
proper," "individual," and, one thing 
leading to another, signifiable, 
legislatable, subject to law and 
morality.

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

After that confrontation with the 
boundary between the
sexes, the biblical text continues its 
journey fully within the
image of the body and its limits.
BOUNDARIES OF THE SELF'S CLEAN AND
PROPER BODY
Chapters 13 and 14 of Leviticus locate 
impurity in leprosy: skin
tumor, impairment of the cover that 
guarantees corporeal integrity, sore on 
the visible, presentable surface. To be 
sure,
leprosy does objectively cause serious 
damages in a people with
a strong community life and, moreover, 
an often nomadic one.
But one may note furthermore that the 
disease visibly affects
the skin, the essential if not initial 
boundary of biological and
psychic individuation. From that point 
of view, the abomination of leprosy 
becomes inscribed within the logical 
conception
of impurity to which I have already 
called attention: intermixture, erasing 
of differences, threat to identity.
The shift taking place between chapters 
12 and 13 seems
significant to me; it goes from within 
the maternal body (childbirth, menses) 
to the decaying body. By means of what 
turnabout is the mother's interior 
associated with decay? I have
already noted that turning among split 
subjects (see pp.
53-55)- It is reasonable to assume that 
the biblical text, in its
own way, accurately follows the path of 
an analogous fantasy.
Evocation of the maternal body and 
childbirth induces the
image of birth as a violent act of 
expulsion through which the
nascent body tears itself away from the 
matter of maternal
insides. Now, the skin apparently never 
ceases to bear the traces
of such matter. These are persecuting 
and threatening traces,
by means of which the fantasy of the 
born body, tightly held
in a placenta that is no longer 
nourishing but devastating, converges 
with the reality of leprosy. One 
additional step, and one
refuses even more drastically a mother 
with whom pre-Oedipal
identification is intolerable. The 
subject then gives birth to himself by 
fantasizing his own bowels as the 
precious fetus of which
he is to be delivered; and yet it is an 
abject fetus, for even if he
calls them his own he has no other idea 
of the bowels than one

101

102 SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

of abomination, which links him to the 
ab-ject, to that nonintrojected mother 
who is incorporated as devouring, and 
intolerable. The obsession of the 
leprous and decaying body
would thus be the fantasy of a 
self-rebirth on the part of a
subject who has not introjected his 
mother but has incorporated
a devouring mother. Phantasmatically, 
he is the solidary obverse of a cult of 
the Great Mother: a negative and 
demanding
identification with her imaginary 
power. Aside from sanitary
effectiveness, that is the fantasy that 
Levitical abominations aim
at cutting back or resorbing. Possibly, 
one could link to the
same rejection of nonconformity with 
corporeal identity the
abjection brought about by physical 
defect:
For whatsoever man he be that hath a 
blemish, he shall not approach;
a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath 
a flat nose, or any thing
superfluous,
Or a man that is brokenfooted, or 
brokenhanded, 
.....................................
........................................
.... he shall not come nigh to offer 
the bread
of his God. (Leviticus 21:18-21)
The body must bear no trace of its debt 
to nature: it must
be clean and proper in order to be 
fully symbolic. In order to
confirm that, it should endure no gash 
other than that of circumcision, 
equivalent to sexual separation and/or 
separation
from the mother. Any other mark would 
be the sign of belonging to the impure, 
the non-separate, the non-symbolic, the
non-holy:
Ye shall not round the corners of your 
heads, neither shalt thou mar
the corners of thy beard.
Ye shall not make any cuttings in your 
flesh for the dead, nor print
any marks upon you . . . (Leviticus 
19:27-28)
Chapter 15 confirms that view: this 
time it is flow that is
impure. Any secretion or discharge, 
anything that leaks out of
the feminine or masculine body defiles. 
After a reference to
sacrifice (chapter 16), we again have a 
designation of the impurity of blood:
For it is the life of all flesh; the 
blood of it is for the life thereof:
therefore I said unto the children of 
Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of

:%■...

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

no manner of flesh: for the life of all 
flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever 
eateth it shall be cut off. (Leviticus 
17:14)
After the path we have followed, it is 
easier to understand
the various connotations of blood 
impurity. It takes in the following: 
prohibition of meat diet (following 
upon the prohibition against killing), 
the postdiluvian classification of meat
as in conformity or nonconformity with 
the divine word, the
principle of identity without 
admixture, the exclusion of anything 
that breaks boundaries (flow, drain, 
discharge). From
food to blood, the loop of prohibitions 
has no need of being
looped, for we are still and from the 
beginning within the same
logic of separation. But we are again 
led back to the fundamental
semanticism of that logic, which 
persists in positing an agency
that is other than that of the 
nutritious, the sanguine, in short,
the "natural" maternal.
FROM SEXUAL IDENTITY TO SPEECH AND FROM
ABOMINATION TO MORALS
After that firm and clear reminder, the 
text proceeds anew and
henceforth will translate the logical 
motion of blood and food
abomination into contents further 
removed. In chapter 18, it
will be concerned with defining a 
sexual identity. For that purpose, 
intercourse between same and same will 
have to be prohibited—neither 
promiscuity within families nor 
homosexuality.
Nor can there be contact with another 
group as constituted by
law (human or "natural," that is, 
always divine): no adultery,
no zoophilia. Likewise, in verse 19 of 
chapter 19,
Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt 
not let thy cattle gender with
a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy 
field with mingled seed: neither
shall a garment mingled of linen and 
woollen come upon thee.
The same condemnation of hybrids and 
migrant beings can
probably be read in the prohibition 
against leavened bread and
the recommendation that azyme be eaten 
on certain occasions
in order to renew ties with the 
original food of the patriarchs;
without the adding of leaven, the 
elements of such bread have
only their own, proper qualities.-

103

104

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

We then encounter one of the extreme 
points of that logic,
which masterfully states, after having 
thus established their
foundations, the bases of those 
separations. It is nothing other
but the One God:
Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, 
that ye commit not any one
of these abominable customs, which were 
committed before you, and
that ye defile not yourselves therein: 
I am the Lord your God. (Leviticus 
18:30)
And more clearly still, with that 
emphasis on the divine word
as word that is quoted, transmitted, 
always already prior:
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto all the congregation of the 
children of Israel, and say unto them, 
Ye shall be holy:
for I the Lord your God am holy. 
(Leviticus 19:1-2)
Henceforth, confronting the "future 
perfect" of a discourse
that is One and transmitted, impurity 
moves away from the
material register and is formulated as 
profanation of the divine
name. At this point in the trajectory, 
where the separating
agency asserts its own pure abstract 
value ("holy of holies"),
the impure will no longer be merely the 
admixture, the flow,
the noncompliant, converging on that 
"improper and unclean"
place, which is the maternal living 
being. Defilement will now
be that which impinges on symbolic 
oneness, that is, sham,
substitutions, doubles, idols. "Turn ye 
not unto idols, nor make
to yourselves molten gods: I am the 
Lord, your God" (Leviticus
19:4). Similarly,
Ye shall make you no idols nor graven 
image, neither rear you up a
standing image, neither shall ye set up 
any image of stone in your
land, to bow down unto it: for I am the 
Lord your God. (Leviticus
26:1)

It is moreover in the name of that "I," 
with whom, through
the intermediary of Moses, an entire 
nation complies, that moral
prohibitions, according to the same 
logic of separation, will
follow—those concerning justice, 
honesty, and truth (Leviticus
I9ff).

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION 105

INCEST TABOO
Deuteronomy takes up again and varies 
Levitical abominations
(14, 22, 32), which in fact underlie 
the whole biblical text. But
the recurrence of a specific trope 
should be noted; it embodies
the asserted logic of separation, and 
in my view it points to the
unconscious foundation of such a 
persistence: "Thou shalt not
seethe a kid in his mother's milk" 
(Exodus 23:19, 34:26, Deuteronomy 
14:21).
A dietary prohibition, therefore, in 
which there is no question
of blood, but in which abomination 
seems to proceed from
another flow that mingles two 
identities and connotes the bond
between the one and the other: milk. A 
medium that is common
to mother and child, a food that does 
not separate but binds,
milk, on account of economic and vital 
necessities, is nevertheless not 
prohibited. What is implicated is not 
milk as food
but milk considered in its symbolic 
value. Abomination does
not reside in nourishing but in 
seething, that is, cooking the
young goat in its mother's milk; in 
other words, it amounts
to using milk not in terms of a need 
for survival but according
to cultural culinary fancy, which sets 
up an abnormal bond
between mother and child. I agree with 
J. Soler that this
amounts to a metaphor of incest. Such a 
dietary prohibition
must be understood as prohibition of 
incest, by the same token
as prohibitions that enjoin one from 
taking from a nest the
mother with the young or eggs 
(Deuteronomy 22:6-7), or sacrificing on 
the same day the cow or ewe with their 
young
(Leviticus 22:28).
Later, when rabbinical legislation 
strengthens the rules by
expanding relations between morals and 
impurity, the meaning
of incestuous impurity seems to 
subsist. Thus, when we find
in the Midrash Tanhumah the statement, 
"In this world I abhor
all nations for they are issued of 
impure seed," the phrase "impure seed" 
should be understood as "incestuous."
We are thus led to conclude that 
dietary prohibition, just as
the more abstract expressions of 
Levitical abominations in a
logic of differences ordained by a 
divine "I," are based upon the
prohibition of incest. Far from being 
one of the semantic values

106

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

of that tremendous project of 
separation constituted by the
biblical text, the taboo of the mother 
seems to be its originating
mytheme. Not only because 
psychoanalytic discourse on the
one hand and structural anthropology on 
the other have discovered the 
fundamental role of incest taboo within 
any symbolic organization (individual 
or social); but also and especially
because, as we have seen, the biblical 
text, as it proceeds, comes
back, at the intensive moments of its 
demonstration and expansion, to that 
mytheme of the archaic relation to the 
mother.
Biblical abjection thus translates a 
crucial semantics in which
the dietary, when it departs from the 
conformity that can be
demanded by the logic of separation, 
blends with the maternal
as unclean and improper coalescence, as 
undifferentiated power
and threat, a defilement to be cut off.
THE PROPHETS, OR INESCAPABLE ABJECTION
If reminders of dietary abomination 
persist in the Yahwist text,
while the Elohist strengthens 
sociological and moral aspects,
this does not prevent the originating 
"mytheme" from being
present everywhere. And yet it is the 
prophetic strand that
carried that "mytheme" into full 
blossoming. Particularly,
through Ezekiel, who inherited from 
Leviticus the positing of
the Law of purity and the Law of 
holiness, and who wends his
way toward a theological distinction 
between pure and impure.
And it is upon the return from exile 
that the distinction, as
Isaiah formulates it, will thoroughly 
rule the life of Israel. The
impure is neither banished nor cut off, 
it is thrust away but
within—right there, working, 
constitutive.
For your hands are defiled with blood, 
and your fingers with iniquity; . . . 
(Isaiah 59:3)
But we are all as an unclean thing, and 
all our righteousnesses are
as filthy rags. (Isaiah 64:6)
A people that provoketh me to anger 
continually to my face; that
sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth 
incense upon altars of brick;
Which remain among the graves, and 
lodge in the monuments,

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION 107

which eat swine's flesh, and broth of 
abominable things is in their
vessels; . . . (Isaiah 65:3—4)
Abjection—dietary, sanguine, and 
moral—is pushed back
within the chosen people, not because 
they are worse than
others, but because in the light of the 
contract that they alone
have entered into, abjection appears as 
such. The existence and
degree of abjection are thus predicated 
on the very position of
the logic of separation. Such at least 
is the conclusion one can
draw from the prophets' insistence upon 
abjection. As far as
the concept of a subjective 
interiorization of abjection is 
concerned, that will be the 
accomplishment of the New Testament.
The logical complicity, the economic 
inseparability of pure
and impure in the Bible, become clear, 
if need be, thanks to
the very word that, in Isaiah, 
indicates impurity: t'bh, to'ebah,
an abomination that is also a 
prohibition (1:13). Henceforth
such a notion permeates the entire 
Bible. On could notice,
moreover, as early as Leviticus, for 
instance, that there was no
true opposition between tahor and tame 
since "impure" (see
Leviticus 11:7-8, 10, 20) already 
signified, "impure to you, the
faithful to Yahweh" or, "they will make 
you impure because
they are an abomination to Yahweh."13
Here we can interpret biblical 
abomination as the agency of
a demoniacal reproduction of the 
speaking being, whom the
compact with God points to, causes to 
exist, and banishes.
Biblical impurity could be "a realized 
form of demoniacal
forces"14 only to the extent that the 
prophetic leaven transformed the 
dietary abomination of earlier texts 
into an inseparable
lining, an inherence in the contract or 
the symbolic condition.
Such a demoniacal force (thus not at 
all autonomous but only
intrinsic to and coiled within divine 
speech) is in fact the impure,
from which the Temple and the 
separating divine Speech want
to differentiate us, and which appears 
to the Prophets as nonrejectable, 
parallel, inseparable from the clean 
and proper and
the identical. What is the 
demoniacal—an inescapable, repulsive, 
and yet nurtured abomination? The 
fantasy of an archaic
force, on the near side of separation, 
unconscious, tempting us
to the point of losing our differences, 
our speech, our life; to
the point of aphasia, decay, 
opprobrium, and death?

108

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

One must add, to the prophetic mutation 
of abjection, the
lot the subsequent life of the Jewish 
nation assigned to it. I shall
not go into the details of a history 
that Neusner has analyzed,
particularly in his work on Mishnaic 
Law.15 Let me simply
recall that the destruction of the 
Temple transformed rites and
beliefs: dietary taboos became even 
more strict, their moral
meaning was strengthened, and the 
holiness of the Temple
extended to the whole of inhabited 
space. "As long as the Temple remained, 
the altar was expiatory for Israel, but 
now each
man's table is expiatory for him" 
(Berakoth).
WASTE-BODY, CORPSE-BODY
Contrary to what enters the mouth and 
nourishes, what goes
out of the body, out of its pores and 
openings, points to the
infinitude of the body proper and gives 
rise to abjection. Fecal
matter signifies, as it were, what 
never ceases to separate from
a body in a state of permanent loss in 
order to become autonomous, distinct 
from the mixtures, alterations, and 
decay that run
through it. That is the price the body 
must pay if it is to become
clean and proper. Psychoanalysis has 
indeed seen that anal dejections 
constitute the first material 
separation that is controllable
by the human being. It has also 
deciphered, in that very rejection, the 
mastered repetition of a more archaic 
separation (from
the maternal body) as well as the 
condition of division (highlow), of 
discretion, of difference, of 
recurrence, in short the
condition of the processes that 
underpin symbolicity.I6 The
biblical abominations, of which we have 
just seen the oral,
dietary anchoring, and which Isaiah 
(6:5) calls attention to by
means of a strikingly condensed 
statement, "I am a man of
unclean lips," are often carried over 
to waste, dirt—human or
animal decay. But allusion to 
excremental abjection is not lacking 
either; it is even explicitly mentioned 
by the Prophets. Thus,
Zechariah (3:1-4) presents the high 
priest Joshua as "clothed
with filthy garments" that the Angel 
orders to be taken away
from him, saying, "I have caused thine 
iniquity to pass from
thee"; the word for "filthy" is here 
so'im, excrementious. Or
in Ezekiel (4:12), "And thou shalt eat 
it as barley cakes, and

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION 109

thou shalt bake it with dung that 
cometh out of man, in their
sight." A mouth attributed to the anus: 
is that not the ensign
of a body to be fought against, taken 
in by its insides, thus
refusing to meet the Other? Hence, 
logically, if the priests do
not listen to God, "Behold, I will 
corrupt your seed, and spread
dung upon your faces, even the dung of 
your solemn feasts;
and one shall take you away with it" 
(Malachi 2:3).
But it is the corpse—like, more 
abstractly, money or the
golden calf—that takes on the abjection 
of waste in the biblical
text. A decaying body, lifeless, 
completely turned into dejection, 
blurred between the inanimate and the 
inorganic, a transitional swarming, 
inseparable lining of a human nature 
whose
life is undistinguishable from the 
symbolic—the corpse represents 
fundamental pollution. A body without 
soul, a non-body,
disquieting matter, it is to be 
excluded from God's territory as
it is from his speech. Without always 
being impure, the corpse
is "accursed of God" (Deuteronomy 
21:23): it must not be
displayed but immediately buried so as 
not to pollute the divine
earth. Connected nevertheless with 
excrement and impure on
that account ('erwat davar, Deuteronomy 
24:1), the corpse is to
an even greater degree that by means of 
which the notion of
impurity slips into that of abomination 
and/or prohibition, to'ebah.
In other words, if the corpse is waste, 
transitional matter, mixture, it is 
above all the opposite of the 
spiritual, of the symbolic,
and of divine law. Impure animals 
become even more impure
once they are dead (Leviticus 
11:24-40), contact with their carcasses 
must be avoided. The human corpse is a 
fount of impurity
and must not be touched (Numbers 
19:13ft). Burial is a means
of purification: "And seven months 
shall the house of Israel be
burying of [Gog and all his multitude], 
that they may cleanse
the land" (Ezekiel 39:12).
Corpse fanciers, unconscious worshipers 
of a soulless body,
are thus preeminent representatives of 
inimical religions, identified by their 
murderous cults. The priceless debt to 
great
mother nature, from which the 
prohibition of Yahwistic speech
separates us, is concealed in such 
pagan cults.
And when they shall say unto you, Seek 
unto them that have familiar
spirits, and unto wizards that peep and 
that mutter: should not a

IIO

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

people seek unto their God? for the 
living to the dead? (Isaiah 8:19)
Or again:
[People] which remain among the graves, 
and lodge in the monuments, which eat 
swine's flesh, and broth of abominable 
things is in
their vessels (Isaiah 65:4)
Worshiping corpses on the one hand, 
eating objectionable
meat on the other: those are the two 
abominations that bring
about divine malediction and thus point 
to the two ends of the
chain of prohibitions that binds the 
biblical text and entails, as
I have suggested, a whole range of 
sexual or moral prohibitions.
ABOMINATION OF CORPSES WARDS OFF DEATH 
WISH.
TAXONOMY AS MORALS
With the taboo on corpses the 
assortment of biblical taboos
returns to what we have seen was its 
point of departure. One
remembers that dietary taboos had been 
spelled out after Noah's
burnt offerings to God and that, 
particularly throughout Leviticus, 
prohibitions accompanied the 
requirements of sacrifice.
The two logical strands that run 
through the biblical text to be
joined together at the time of burnt 
offerings or separated later
on, sacrifice and abomination, reveal 
their true interdependence
at the moment when the corpse topples 
from being the object
of worship over to being the object of 
abomination. Taboo appears
then as a counterbalance to sacrifice. 
Strengthening the system
of prohibitions (dietary or other) 
becomes more and more important to the 
spiritual scene, and that constitutes 
the true symbolic covenant with God. 
Prohibiting instead of killing—such is
the lesson of the proliferation of 
biblical abominations. Separation at 
the same time as union; taboo and 
sacrifice partake of
the logic that sets up symbolic order.
But one must stress what differentiates 
those two currents
beyond their similarity. The killed 
object, from which I am
separated through sacrifice, while it 
links me to God it also sets
itself up, in the very act of being 
destroyed, as desirable, fascinating, 
and sacred. What has been killed 
subdues me and
' brings me into subjection to what has 
been sacrificed. To the

SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

contrary, the abjected object from 
which I am separated through
abomination, if it guarantees a pure 
and holy law, turns me
aside, cuts me off, and throws me out. 
The abject tears me
away from the indifferentiated and 
brings me into subjection
to a system. In short, the abominate is 
a response to the sacred,
its exhaustion, its ending. The 
biblical text does away with
sacrifice, particularly human 
sacrifice: Isaac is not offered to
God. If Judaism remains a religion due 
to the sacrificial act,
which persists in order to insure the 
metaphorical, vertical relation of the 
officiating priest to the One Alone, 
that foundation
is largely compensated by the 
considerable expansion of the
prohibitions that take over from it and 
transform its economy
into a metonymic, horizontal 
concatenation. A religion of
abomination overlays a religion of the 
sacred. It marks the exit
of religion and the unfolding of 
morals; or leading back the
One that separates and unifies, not to 
the fascinated contemplation of the 
sacred, from which it separates, but to 
the very
device that it ushers in: logic, 
abstraction, rules of systems and
judgments. When the victim is changed 
into an abomination,
a deep qualitative change takes place: 
the religion that ensues,
even if it continues to harbor 
sacrifice, is no longer a sacrificial
religion. It tempers the fascination of 
murder; it gets around
its desire by means of the abomination 
it associates with any
act of incorporation and rejection of 
an ob-ject, thing or living
being. What you sacrifice by 
swallowing, like what you suppress by 
rejecting, nourishing mother or corpse, 
are merely
pre-texts of the symbolic relation that 
links you to Meaning.
Use them to give existence to the One, 
but do not make them
sacred in themselves. Nothing is sacred 
outside of the One. At
the limit, everything that remains, all 
remainders, are abominable.
Contrary to accepted interpretation, 
Rene Girard maintains
that Christian religion breaks with 
sacrifice as the condition of
the sacred and the social contract. 
Christ, far from being a
scapegoat, indeed offers himself to a 
death-and-resurrection that
causes sin to be visited on all members 
of the community and
on each individually, instead of 
absolving them; it thus prepared
them for a (phantasmatic?)-society 
without violence.17 Whatever interest 
that argument might or might not have, 
one thing
'

/

III

112 SEMIOTICS OF BIBLICAL ABOMINATION

is clear: it is the Bible, particularly 
through its emphasis on
abominations, that starts the process 
of going beyond a sacrificial concept 
of the social and/or symbolic contract. 
Not only
shall you not kill, but you shall not 
sacrifice anything without
observing rules and prohibitions. The 
tenth chapter of Leviticus
brings in as clear consequence all the 
regulations concerning
dietary taboo. The law of purity and 
holiness that ensues is
what replaces sacrifice.
As a lay person, I might ask what that 
Law is. It is what
curtails sacrifice. The law, in other 
words what restrains the
desire to kill, is a taxonomy. Even if 
it is only after the period
of exile, and in place of earlier 
tribal rules, that homicide becomes the 
object of a sacred law that changes 
murder into defilement for Israel and 
establishes rules for atonement, the 
very
idea of homicide as an offense to God 
is present throughout the
biblical text.18 "Whoso sheddeth man's 
blood, by man shall his
blood be shed" (Genesis 9:6); "So ye 
shall not pollute the land
wherein ye are: for blood it defileth 
the land: and the land cannot
be cleansed of the blood that is shed 
therein, but by the blood
of him that shed it" (Numbers 35:33).
Death drive, in such an adjustment, 
does not disappear on
that account. Checked, it becomes 
displaced and builds a logic.
If abomination is the lining of my 
symbolic being, "I" am
therefore heterogeneous, pure and 
impure, and as such always
potentially condemnable. I am from the 
very beginning subject
to persecution as well as to revenge. 
The infinite meshing of
expulsions and hazings, of divisions 
and inexorable, abominable
reprisals is then thrown into gear. The 
system of abominations
sets in motion the persecuting machine 
in which I assume the
place of the victim in order to justify 
the purification that will
separate me from that place as it will 
from any other, from all
others. Mother and death, both 
abominated, abjected, slyly
build a victimizing and persecuting 
machine at the cost of which
I become subject of the Symbolic as 
well as Other of the Abject.
"Ye shall be holy and made holy, 
separate (pureshim) from the
nations of the world and their 
abominations" (the Mekhilta on
"And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of 
priests, and an holy
nation"—Exodus 19:6).

Nietzsche, The Antichrist

INSIDE/OUTSIDE
It is through abolishment of dietary 
taboos, partaking of food
with pagans, verbal and gestural 
contact with lepers, as well
as through its power over impure 
spirits that the message of
Christ is characterized and, as is well 
known, compels recognition in a most 
spectacular manner—superficial perhaps 
but
striking. Those indications should not 
be construed as simply
anecdotal or empirical, nor as drastic 
staging of a polemic with
Judaism. What is happening is that a 
new arrangement of differences is being 
set up, an arrangement whose economy 
will
regulate a wholly different system of 
meaning, hence a wholly
different speaking subject. An 
essential trait of those evangelical
attitudes or narratives is that 
abjection is no longer exterior. It
is permanent and comes from within. 
Threatening, it is not cut
off but is reabsorbed into speech. 
Unacceptable, it endures
through the subjection to God of a 
speaking being who is innerly divided 
and, precisely through speech, does not 
cease
purging himself of it.
Such an interiorization of abjection, 
before being effected
through the assumption of Christie 
subjectivity within the Trinity, is 
brought about through an expedient that 
takes over Lev-

114

• • ■ QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

itical abominations but changes their 
location. That expedient
is oralization, which the New Testament 
will try to rehabilitate,
render guiltless, before inverting the 
pure/impure dichotomy
into an outside/inside one.
The New Testament texts of chapters 15 
in Matthew and 16
in Mark compress the event that opens 
out on a new logic.
After having noted that the Pharisees' 
faith is completely centered in 
appearances (too strongly tied to 
orality?)—"This people honoureth me 
with their lips, but their heart is far 
from
me" (Mark 7:6)—Jesus affirms, "Not that 
which goeth into the
mouth defileth a man; but that which 
cometh out of the mouth,
this defileth a man" (Matthew 15:11); 
and also, "There is nothing from 
without a man, that entering into him 
can defile him:
but things which come out of him, those 
are they that defile
the man" (Mark: 15).
Other instances give evidence that the 
emphasis is henceforth
placed on the inside/outside boundary, 
and that the threat comes
no longer from outside but from within. 
"But rather give alms
of such things as ye have; and, behold, 
all things are clean unto
you" (Luke 11:41); "Thou blind 
Pharisee, cleanse first that
which is within the cup and platter, 
that the outside of them
may be clean also" (Matthew 23:26); 
"Woe unto you, scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are 
like unto whited sepulchres, which 
indeed appear beautiful outward, but 
are within
full of dead men's bones, and of all 
uncleanness. Even so ye
also outwardly appear righteous unto 
men, but within ye are
full of hypocrisy and iniquity" 
(Matthew 23:27-28). While it
is true that reminders of Levitical 
positions are not lacking (thus,
in 2 Corinthians 6:17 to 7:1, 
"Wherefore come out from among
them, and be ye separate, saith the 
Lord, and touch not the
unclean thing, and I will receive you," 
and so forth), the interiorization of 
impurity is in progress everywhere: 
"For, when
we were come into Macedonia, our flesh 
had no rest, but we
were troubled on every side; without 
were fightings, within
were fears" (2 Corinthians 7:5).
But let me go back to texts by Matthew 
and Mark who take
more time with that reversal. The 
already quoted Christie
speech, "There is nothing from without 
a man, that entering

. . . QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

into him can defile him: but the things 
which come out of him,
those are they that defile the man," 
and so forth, is in each case
preceded by the reproach, directed at 
the Pharisees, for honoring God too 
much and their fathers and mothers too 
little.
It is thus an appeal to the recognition 
not so much of a Law
as of a concrete, genetic, and social 
authority—a natural one,
so to speak—that leads to the 
interiorization of impurity.
Through re-cognition of your parents, 
that which is external
threat to you will appear as internal 
danger. The verses that
follow are even more definite in the 
invitation to mend the
initial filial relationship.
FROM FOOD TO EARS: A MOTHER
A woman who was "a Syrophenician by 
nation" (Mark 7:26)
or else a "lost sheep of the house of 
Israel" (Matthew 15:24)
asks for help in order to "cast forth 
the devil out of her
daughter" (Mark 7:26). "But Jesus said 
unto her, Let the children first be 
filled: for it is not meet to take the 
children's bread
and cast it unto the dogs" (Mark 7:27). 
And it is only after the
mother answers, "the dogs under the 
table eat of the children's
crumbs," that Christ will acknowledge 
the recovery of her
daughter, the devil having gone out of 
the child's body. It is
as if the mother had to agree to "fill" 
her child, give her a
privileged food, distinct from the 
"crumbs" for dogs, before
the devil would go away and the woman 
open her heart to the
words of Christ.
The nutritive opening up to the other, 
the full acceptance of
archaic and gratifying relationship to 
the mother, pagan as it
might be, and undoubtedly conveying 
paganistic connotations
of a prolific and protective 
motherhood, is here the condition
for another opening—the opening up to 
symbolic relations,
true outcome of the Christicjourney. 
For after the reconciliation
between mother and daughter through the 
agency of satisfying
nourishment, it is a deaf-mute whom 
Christ relieves: "And he
took him aside from the multitude, and 
put his fingers into his
ears, and he spit, and touched his 
tongue; And looking up to
heaven, he sighed, and said unto, him, 
Ephphatha, that is, Be

115

Il6

... QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

Opened. And straightaway his ears were 
opened, and the string
of his tongue was loosed, and he spake 
plain" (Mark 7:33-35).
As in analytic process, the reader of 
the New Testament is
led, by elaborating on the archaic 
relation to his parents, particularly 
the oral relation to his mother, to 
introject the drivequality attached to 
archaic objects. Now, without that 
introjection, pre-objects and abjects 
threaten from without as impurity, 
defilement, abomination, and eventually 
they trigger
the persecutive apparatus. 
Nevertheless, that introjection, aiming 
to salve, is not trouble free. For 
evil, thus displaced into the
subject, will not cease tormenting him 
from within, no longer
as a polluting or defiling substance, 
but as the ineradicable repulsion of 
his henceforth divided and 
contradictory being.
One can find an exemplary tale of such 
an interiorization of
impurity in the Oxyrhynchus papyrus 
number 840.' Accused
by a Pharisee of having entered the 
Temple without taking a
bath, while the Pharisee considers 
himself pure because he
bathed, Jesus answers: "... you have 
cleansed that outer skin,
the skin that whores and flute players 
also anoint, bathe, cleanse,
and adorn in order to arouse men's 
lust, whereas inside they are
filled with scorpions and all kinds of 
wickedness. As for me (and
my disciples), who did not bathe, 
according to you, we did bathe
in the running (and pure?) waters that 
come from the Father (who
is in heaven?). But woe unto them ..."
THE INTERIORIZATION OF BIBLICAL 
SEPARATION
Through the process of interiorization, 
defilement will blend
with guilt, which already exists on a 
moral and symbolic level
in the Bible. But out of the merger 
with the more material,
object-like abomination, a new category 
will be established—
Sin. Swallowed up, one might say 
reabsorbed, Christian defilement is by 
that token a revenge of paganism, a 
reconciliation
with the maternal principle. Freud 
moreover stressed the point
in Moses and Monotheism, revealing that 
Christian religion is a
compromise between paganism and Judaic 
monotheism. Biblical logic remains 
nevertheless, even though it is 
inverted (the
inside is to blame, no longer the 
outside): one uncovers it in

. . . QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

the persistence of processes of 
division, separation, and
differentiation.
But this time that logic functions 
exclusively in the signifying
universe of the speaking being, rent 
between two potentialities,
demoniacal and divine. Maternal 
principle, reconciled with the
subject, is not for that matter 
revalorized, rehabilitated. Of its
nourishing as much as threatening 
heterogeneity, later texts,
and even more so theological posterity, 
will keep only the idea
of sinning flesh. On that pivotal 
point, the New Testament will
propose a subtle elaboration of the 
splitting that contemporary
analytic listening discovers in 
so-called split subjects: the boundary 
between inside and outside. Before any 
relation to an other
is set up, and as if underlying it, it 
is the building of that archaic
space, the topological demarcation of 
the preconditions of a
subjectivity, qua difference between a 
sub-ject and an ab-ject
in the be-spoken being itself, that 
takes over from earlier Levitical 
abominations. "Kill, and eat," says God 
to an astonished
Peter at Joppa (Acts 10:9-16). But that 
permission, far from
being a liberalization, will lead the 
subject who complies with
it to seek no longer his defilement but 
the error within his own
thoughts and speech.
DIVISION AND MULTIPLICATION
It is equally remarkable that Jesus' 
pronouncement concerning
man's defilement by what emanates from 
him, rather than by
what enters, is preceded and followed 
by two tales of multiplication of bread 
and fishes (Mark 6:38ff. and 8:i4f£). 
The
word for "bread," artos, is repeated 
seventeen times in this
section, as if to provide it with 
unity. Several lines of thought
appear to converge on that article of 
multiplication. If there is,
on the one hand, a concern for 
"satisfying" the hunger of the
greatest possible number, it is, once 
again, to the spirit that the
food seems destined, for Jesus does not 
cease calling upon understanding to 
decipher the meaning of his action. 
Satisfied
physiological hunger gives way to 
unsatiable spiritual hunger,
a striving for what "it could possibly 
mean." Ultimately, does
not the multiplication of the food, 
miraculous though it may

117

Il8

•

• • QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

be, show how petty excessive fixation 
on one object of need can
be, that object becoming the single, 
obsessive goal of existence?
Even more so, does not that 
multiplication of dietary objects
also constitute (taking into account 
the inward displacement of
emphasis) a sort of invitation to 
multiply, if not relativize,
conscience itself? It is no longer one 
but polyvalent, as is the
entirely parabolic, fictional meaning 
of the miracle. The interiorization of 
abomination as sin, in the New 
Testament, would
thus be not only a centering but even 
more so the condition,
on the basis of that center, of 
pluralizing the object as well as
the subject.
The tie between the multiplication of 
loaves and the Eucharist
is well known; it is established by 
another of Christ's statements, this 
time bringing together body and bread, 
"This is
my body." By surreptitiously mingling 
the theme of "devouring" with that of 
"satiating," that narrative is a way of
taming cannibalism. It invites a 
removal of guilt from the archaic 
relation to the first pre-object 
(ab-ject) of need: the
mother.
FROM ABOMINATION TO LAPSE AND LOGIC.
FROM SUBSTANCE TO ACTION
Through oral-dietary satisfaction, 
there emerges, beyond it, a
lust for swallowing up the other, while 
the fear of impure
nourishment is revealed as deathly 
drive to devour the other.
A primal fantasy if ever there was one, 
that theme unremittingly
accompanies the tendency toward 
interiorizing and spiritualizing the 
abject. It acts as a pedestal for it; 
man is a spiritual,
intelligent, knowing, in short, 
speaking being only to the extent
that he is recognizant of his 
abjection—from repulsion to murder—and 
interiorizes it as such, that is, 
symbolizes it. The division within 
Christian consciousness2 finds in that 
fantasy, of
which the Eucharist is the catharsis, 
its material anchorage and
logical node. Body and spirit, nature 
and speech, divine nourishment, the 
body of Christ, assuming the guise of a 
natural
food (bread), signifies me both as 
divided (flesh and spirit) and
infinitely lapsing. I am divided and 
lapsing with respect to my

. . . QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

119

ideal, Christ, whose introjection by 
means of numerous communions sanctifies 
me while reminding me of my 
incompletion.
Because it identified abjection as a 
fantasy of devouring, Christianity 
effects its abreaction. Henceforth 
reconciled with it, the
Christian subject, completely absorbed 
into the symbolic, is no
longer a being of abjection but a 
lapsing subject.
In consequence of this placement of 
subjective space, judgment
henceforth prevails over the 
preestablished dichotomy between
pure and impure: "But let a man examine 
himself, and so let
him eat of that bread, and drink of 
that cup. For he that eateth
and drinketh unworthily, eateth and 
drinketh damnation to
himself, not discerning the Lord's 
body" (1 Corinthians
11:28-29). A spiritualization of both 
the purity/impurity distinction and the 
inside/outside division of subjective 
space is
thus effected. The understanding of the 
disciples is being appealed
to, in order to have them comprehend 
that the outside of man
cannot possibly defile him: "And are ye 
so without understanding
also? Do ye not perceive that 
whatsoever thing from without
entereth into the man, it cannot defile 
him" (Mark 7:18). The
culmination of that interiorization 
doubtless lies in the proposition that 
impurity is a matter for the subject 
himself to decide:
"I know, and I am persuaded by the Lord 
Jesus, that there is
nothing unclean of itself; but to him 
that esteemeth any thing
to be unclean, to him it is unclean" 
(Romans 14:14). Thus
subordinated to judgment and dependent 
upon the subject, the
impure (or impious) assumes the status 
not of a substance that
is cut off but of an action that is 
indecent. Sin is an action;
theologians speak of "peccaminous" acts.
And yet, if it is true that the notion 
of sin carried that spirituality far, 
it is nevertheless upon a body that its 
highest development rests: the body of 
Christ. Purifying, redeeming all
sins, it punctually and temporarily 
gives back innocence by
means of communion. To eat and drink 
the flesh and blood of
Christ means, on the one hand, to 
transgress symbolically the
Levitical prohibitions, to be 
symbolically satiated (as at the
fount of a good mother who would thus 
expel the devils from
her daughter) and to be reconciled with 
the substance dear to
paganism. By the very gesture, however, 
that corporealizes or

120

... QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

incarnates speech, all corporeality is 
elevated, spiritualized, and
sublimated. Thus one might say that if 
the inside/outside
boundary is maintained, osmosis 
nevertheless takes place between the 
spiritual and the substantial, the 
corporeal and the
signifying—a heterogeneity that cannot 
be divided back into
its components.3
A HETEROGENEOUS BODY—CHRIST
Christ alone, because he accomplished 
that heterogeneity, is a
body without sin. What others must do, 
because of their fault,
is to achieve that sublimation, confess 
the part of themselves
that rebels against divine judgment, a 
part that is innerly
impure.
Because the unrivaled existence of 
Christ is nevertheless the
vanishing point of all fantasies and 
thus a universal object of
faith, everyone is allowed to aspire to 
Christie sublimation and
by the same token know that his sins 
can be remitted. "Your
sins will be forgiven," Jesus keeps 
telling them, thus accomplishing, in 
the future this time, a final raising 
into spirituality
of a nevertheless inexorable carnal 
remainder.
Sin then remains the only token of 
difference from the sublimity of 
Christ. In a universe where differences 
are resorbed
through the effort of an ideal 
identification with the experience
of Christ—an impossible one from the 
very start—Sin, even
if its remission is always promised, 
remains the rock where one
endures the human condition as 
separate: body and spirit, body
jettisoned from the spirit; as a 
condition that is impossible,
irreconcilable, and, by that very 
token, real.
SIN AS DEBT, HOSTILITY, AND INIQUITY
"Confessing sins," "remitting 
sins"—such phrases are probably
liturgic in origin, but in themselves 
they already define sins as
inherent in speech and slated for 
release; one encounters in them
the notions that bespeak the sin-laden 
act: amartia, debt, and
anomia, iniquity.
Clearly Judaic in spirit, debt points 
to a ruthless creditor and

. .

. QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

121

assigns the subject to the place of the 
debtor whose infinite
payment will fill the distance that 
separates him from God only
by means of a faith indefinitely 
maintained. The parallel between the 
sins against the Father and our debt to 
our neighbors
is well known. The verbal use of the 
term is also corroborated.
In Matthew 18:21-22 the verb 
atnartenein is used to refer to a
"sin" against one's brother man, while 
Paul (Acts 25:8) asserts
he has "offended" (emarton) "neither 
against the law of the Jews,
neither against the temple, nor yet 
against Caesar"; and in 1
Corinthians 8:12 he avers that "when ye 
sin (amartanontes) so
against the brethren, and wound their 
weak conscience, ye sin
against Christ (eis Christon 
amartanete)."
Especially with Matthew, or it so 
seems, there is a more
specific use of the word anomia when 
referring to sin as general
hositility to God. This meaning, 
peculiar to the Qumran scrolls,
often directly refers to the Biblical 
text itself (Psalms 6:8, 9 for
instance). "Depart from me, ye that 
work iniquity" (Matthew
7:23); "And because iniquity shall 
abound, the love of many
shall wax cold" (Matthew 24:12), and 
especially: "Even so ye
also outwardly appear righteous unto 
men, but within ye are
full of hyprocrisy and iniquity" 
(Matthew 23:28).
John also wrote that "sin is the 
transgression of the law" (I
John 3:4), and even if many 
commentators note that a-nomia,
in this instance—as elsewhere in the 
New Testament—should
not be connected with nomos, it is 
indeed a transgression of
divine jurisdiction, akin to that of 
the Torah, that is involved
in that definition. Is not the sinner 
the one who places himself
under the rule of Satan, by virtue of 
his breaking away from
the new "commandments" (entole) of 
Christ (1 John 4:21)?
On the level of debt and iniquity, even 
more so than that of
impurity, sin is set forth as 
constitutive of man, coming to him
from the depth of his heart, thus 
recalling the original sin of
Adam. "O generation of vipers, how can 
ye, being evil, speak
good things? for out of the abundance 
of the heart the mouth
speaketh" (Matthew 12:34). As debt and 
iniquity, breach of duty
or injustice, sin is an act and is 
proven to be within man's
jurisdiction, within the scope of his 
own responsibility. Here
then is the list of sins according to 
the Gospels, which Paul will

122

... QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

expand: "For from within, out of the 
heart of men, proceed
evil thoughts, adulteries, 
fornications, murders, thefts, 
covetousness, wickedness, deceit, 
lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, 
pride, foolishness" (Mark 7:21-22; in 
Matthew 15:19
the number of sins is down to seven).
Now it is precisely the sinner and not 
the righteous whom
Christ addresses, and his major role is 
to drive out evil spirits
and devils, to remit sins. The 
heterogeneity of Christ, Son of
both Man and God, resorbs and cleanses 
the demoniacal. Such
heterogeneity does not cease revealing 
the moral and symbolic
existence of infamy; nevertheless, as 
it is communicated to the
sinner by means of his very being, it 
saves him from the abject.
THE DOORS OF THE INQUISITION
Based in large part on the idea of 
retribution, the notion of sin
doubtless leads one to adopt a behavior 
and speech of conformity, obedience, 
and self-control under the ruthless 
gaze of the
Other—Justice, Good, or Golden Mean. 
Basis of asceticism at
the same time as it is coiled in 
judgment, sin guides one along
the straitest paths of superego 
spirituality. It holds the keys that
open the doors to Morality and 
Knowledge, and at the same
time those of the Inquisition.
But what will now hold our attention is 
that sin is also the
requisite of the Beautiful. On that 
plane, through an additional
twist, the Law of the Other becomes 
reconciled with Satan. As
a result, the Christian 
self-contradiction that Nietzsche 
denounced, once its inimical parts have 
been reconciled, constitutes the 
requisite for jouissance. The episode 
of Christ and the
repentant sinner, the woman who "stood 
at his feet behind him
weeping, and began to wash his feet 
with tears, and did wipe
them with the hairs of her head, and 
kissed his feet, and anointed
them with the ointment" (Luke 7:38) 
conveys that meaning.
Contrary to the prophet who, according 
to the Pharisee, would
have recognized impurity in this woman 
and withdrawn from
her, Christ gives himself up to it, 
deluged with a kind of overflowing—of 
sin or love? It is, at any rate, the 
overflow of an
interior flux and its ambiguity bursts 
forth in that scene. Sin,

. . QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

turned upside down into love, attains, 
on account of the ambivalence, the 
beauty that Hegel tells us is displayed 
right here
for the one and only time in the 
Gospels. "Wherefore I say
unto thee, Her sins, which are many, 
are forgiven; for she loved
much: but to whom little is forgiven, 
the same loveth little"
(Luke 7:47).
SIN AS REQUISITE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL
Neither debt nor want, sin, as the 
reverse side of love, is a state
of fullness, of plenty. In that sense, 
it turns around into living
beauty. Far from advocating solely a 
doctrine of limitation and
conformity to divine speech, the 
Christian conception of sin
also includes a recognition of an evil 
whose power is in direct
ratio to the holiness that identifies 
it as such, and into which
it can convert. Such a conversion into 
jouissance and beauty
goes far beyond the retributive, 
legalistic tonality of sin as debt
or iniquity. Thus it is that, by means 
of the beautiful, the
demoniacal dimension of the pagan world 
can be tamed. And
that the beautiful penetrates into 
Christianity to the extent of
becoming not merely one of its 
component parts, but also probably what 
leads it beyond religion.
AN OVERFLOWING OF DESIRE
The idea of "want" tied to sin as debt 
and iniquity is therefore
coupled with that of an overflowing, a 
profusion, even an unquenchable desire, 
which are pejoratively branded with 
words
like "lust" or "greed." Pleonexia, 
greed, is etymologically the
desire "to possess always more"; it 
connotes an appetite that
cannot possibly be sated, and that 
links it, in the writings of
Paul for instance, to sexual 
transgressions and flesh in general;
for the cause of this appetite resides 
in idolatry as disobedience
to divine speech. "Wherefore God also 
gave them up to uncleanness through the 
lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour
their own bodies between themselves: 
Who changed the truth
of God into a lie [ ... ] For this 
cause God gave them up unto

123

124

• • • QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

vile affections" (Romans 1:24, 26). 
"Lust," or epithumia, depending 
directly on the biblical text, also 
covers sexual desires
while relating, particularly in the Old 
Testament, to food as
well as to various material goods.
At any rate, those various descriptions 
of sin converge on the
flesh or rather on what might be 
called, by anticipation, an
overwhelming release of drives, 
unrestrained by the symbolic.
"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, 
and ye shall not fulfill the
lust of the flesh. For the flesh 
lusteth against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh: and these are 
contrary the one to the
other: so that ye cannot do the things 
that ye would" (Galatians
5:16-17). The outcome, the telos of 
this carnal overflow can
only be death ("For the wages of sin is 
death," Romans 6:23;
"For when we were in the flesh, the 
motions of sins, which
were by the law, did work in our 
members to bring forth fruit
unto death," Romans 7:5), which is what 
sin leads to.
One of the most complex nodes of 
Christian or at least Pauline theory is 
precisely centered in that matter of 
the flesh. For
on the one hand, the flesh is plainly 
marked, echoing later Greek
thought, as that from which one should 
be separated ("Therefore, brethren, we 
are debtors, not to the flesh, to live 
after the
flesh," Romans 8:12). Whereas, 
elsewhere, we have the following: "For 
though we walk in the flesh, we do not 
war after the
flesh" (II Corinthians 10:3), and "The 
life which I now live in
the flesh I live by the faith of the 
Son of God, who loved me,
and gave himself for me" (Galatians 
2:20). Displaying more
than lack of univocity, it is a 
heterogeneous conception of the\
flesh that is being set forth.
In opposition to the peaceful 
Apollonian (not Dionysiac)
Greek corporeality, flesh here 
signifies according to two modalities: 
on the one hand, close to Hebraic flesh 
(basar), it points
to the "body" as eager drive confronted 
with the law's harshness; on the other, 
it points to a subdued "body," a body 
that
is pneumatic since it is spiritual, 
completely submersed into
(divine) speech in order to become 
beauty and love.
These two "bodies" are obviously 
inseparable, the second
("sublimated") one unable to exist 
without the first (perverse

. . . QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

125

because it challenges Law). One of the 
insights of Christianity,
and not the least one, is to have 
gathered in a single move
perversion and beauty as the lining and 
the cloth of one and
the same economy.
MASSA DAMNATA AND METANOIA
The two currents of sin interpretation 
that have buffeted the
Church for centuries appear to have 
been centered in that particular 
ambiguity of the flesh. Was Adam a 
sinner to begin
with, or did he become one of his own 
"free will"? Does not
sin have a mortgage on the power of the 
spirit and grace? If
God can grant remission of sin, can a 
man, a priest do the same?
What is meant by the sin of angels? Is 
sin original and hereditary?
And so forth. It is a long story, and 
if it has officially been
brought to a close in the institutions 
that rule society in our
time, it is brought to life again every 
time a man touches on
those areas, those nodes, where 
symbolicity interferes with his
corporeality.
Above all, one will recall Augustine's 
stance, according to
which, man, born blind and ignorant, is 
unable to observe the
law after it has been revealed, 
"because of some unaccountable
constraining resistance due to carnal 
concupiscence."4 A created
being that is always already evil, even 
if free will gives it responsibility 
for sin, such would be the ambiguity of 
the speaking being. Permanence of sin, 
existence but restriction of the
power of free will—these will fit into 
a different pattern in the
later Augustinian writings: man is 
good, but his offense turns
human beings into a massa damnata. It 
is not absurd to consider
that such traces of Manicheism 
doubtless make of Augustine
a precursor of Protestantism but 
especially the first psychological 
writer (see the Confessions). Through 
his writing, he follows
the delightful interlacing of this 
inextricable heterogeneity, of
this seesawing between the excesses of 
the flesh and the stern
though merciful demands of absolute 
judgment. In so doing,
he shows how damnation, because it 
depends on spirituality,
turns not only into humiliated consent 
but above all into en-

126

... QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

raptured conversion or, as he writes, 
into a metanoia, a
jouissance.
SIN: OWING TO GOD OR TO WOMAN?
The brimming flesh of sin belongs, of 
course, to both sexes;
but its root and basic representation 
is nothing other than feminine 
temptation. That was already stated in 
Ecdesiasticus: "Sin
originated with woman and because of 
her we all perish." The
reference to Eve's enticement of Adam 
is clear, but in other
respects it is certain that Paul 
stigmatizes a much more physical
corporeality, one closer to Greek 
notions of it, when he implants
the power of sin within the flesh. And 
yet, the tale of Adam's
fall opens up two additional channels 
of interpretation throwing
light on the ambivalence of sin. The 
one locates it in relation
to God's will and in that sense causes 
it to be not only original
but coexistent with the very act of 
signification; the other places
it within the 
femininity-desire-food-abjection series.
Let me pause and consider the first 
point of view, which
Hegel calls a "marvelous, contradictory 
feature."5 On the one
hand, according to the narrative, man 
before the fall, man in
paradise, was to live eternally; since 
it is sin that leads to death,
man without sin was in a state of 
immortality. On the other
hand, however, it is stated that man 
would be immortal if he
ate from the tree of life—the tree of 
knowledge—hence if he
transgressed the prohibition, in short 
if he sinned. Man would
thus accede to divine perfection only 
by sinning, that is, by
carrying out the forbidden act of 
knowledge. Now, the knowledge that 
would separate him from his natural, 
animal, and
mortal state, enabling him to reach, 
through thought, purity
and freedom, is fundamentally sexual 
knowledge. It takes only
one further step to suppose that the 
invitation to perfection is
also an invitation to sin, and 
conversely; perhaps official theology 
does not take that step, but the mystic 
grants himself the
fathomless depravity of doing so. That 
is so true that only after
having sinned does the mystic topple 
over into holiness, and
his holiness never ceases to appear to 
him as fringed by sin.
Such is the cognitive aspect of the 
narrative of the fall. In that

. . . QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

instance, the fall is the work of God; 
founding knowledge and
the quest for consciousness, it opens 
the way to spirituality.
WOMAN OR ABJECTION RECONCILED
Seen from a different viewpoint, the 
story of the fall sets up
a diabolical otherness in relation to 
the divine. Adam is no
longer endowed with the composed nature 
of paradisiac man,
he is torn by covetous desire: desire 
for woman—sexual covetousness since the 
serpent is its master, consuming desire 
for
food since the apple is its object. He 
must protect himself from
that sinful food that consumes him and 
that he craves. We know
how the more material, more organic 
trend of thought of Levitical texts 
protects itself from abomination; 
against revulsion—
abjection. Christian sin, tying its 
spiritual knot between flesh
and law, does not cut off the abject. 
No more than the sinner
brought by the Pharisees will the 
adulterous woman be stoned
to death: "He that is without sin among 
you, let him first cast
a stone at her" (John 8:7): "Neither do 
I condemn thee: go and
sin no more" (John 8:11). Meant for 
remission, sin is what is
absorbed—in and through speech. By the 
same token, abjection
will not be designated as such, that 
is, as other, as something
to be ejected, or separated, but as the 
most propitious place for
communication—as the point where the 
scales are tipped towards pure 
spirituality. The mystic's familiarity 
with abjection
is a fount of infinite jouissance. One 
may stress the masochistic
economy of that jouissance only if one 
points out at once that
the Christian mystic, far from using it 
to the benefit of a symbolic or 
institutional power, displaces it 
indefinitely (as happens
with dreams, for instance) within a 
discourse where the subject
is resorbed (is that grace?) into 
communication with the Other
and with others. One recalls Francis of 
Assisi who visited leproseries "to give 
out alms and left only after having 
kissed
each leper on the mouth"; who stayed 
with lepers and bathed
their wounds, sponging pus and sores. 
One might also think
of Angela of Foligno.
A source of evil and mingled with sin, 
abjection becomes the
requisite for a reconciliation, in the 
mind, between the flesh

127

128

... QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

and the law. "It is at once what 
produces the disease, and the
source of health, [it is the poisoned 
cup in which man drinks
death and putrefaction, and at the same 
time the fount of reconciliation; 
indeed, to set oneself up as evil is to 
abolish evil in
oneself.]"6
LAW AND/OR GRACE
Thus, the Gospel's conception seems to 
distinguish sin from
Adam's downfall. For sin, here, 
subsuming biblical abjection
but more closely associated with the 
passions of the flesh, must
carry out the fearsome process of 
interiorization and spiritualization 
that I have just discussed. Paul, who 
was the first to set
forth a coherent doctrine of sin as 
lust and separation from God,
seems to distinguish sin from Adam's 
transgression (see Romans 5:12-21). Was 
he held back by the paradox of the 
primitive human condition, as it has 
just become manifest to us in
the narrative concerning Adam? Or by 
the fully logical conception of that 
downfall according to the Bible, 
distinct from
abomination? Or is it because there can 
be no remission for the
original misdeed, because no biblical 
grace has been promised?
Christian doctrine, to the contrary, 
carries the ambiguity to the
point of defining sin through its 
possible remission: "For until
the law sin was in the world: but sin 
is not imputed when there
is no law" (Romans 5:13) and "Moreover 
the law entered, that
the offense might abound. But where sin 
abounded, grace did
much more abound" (Romans 5:20).
One could say, in fact, that sin is 
subjectified abjection. For,
always already determined ad unum as 
Thomas Aquinas submits, the created 
being, subordinated to God and at the 
same
time separated from him by free will, 
can commit sin only
through willful nonobservance of the 
rule. It is true that Thomism leads to 
a spiritual, logical excess, 
subjectifying the doctrine of sin and 
taking away its Augustinian delights. 
And yet
one must acknowledge that Aquinas goes 
back to and develops
the notion of logical necessity and 
freedom of knowledge as
coextensive with sin—a notion found in 
the very first narrative
of the fall (what I have called its 
first aspect; see p. 126). Sin

. . . QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

129

as action—as action stemming from will 
and judgment—is
what definitively integrates abjection 
into logic and language.
Thomist considerations on the sin of 
angels is one of the
masterly demonstrations of such a 
consequence. If an angel can
sin because it is a created being and 
does so, for instance, by
loving its own natural perfection, sin 
does not reside in the
object (which cannot here be an abject) 
but in "the inordinate
willing of a thing good in itself."7 
Neither desire nor abjection,
sin is a logical unruliness, an 
incongruous act of judgment. If
defilement was what is impossible 
within a system, if Levitical
taboo was what is excluded from a Law, 
sin, on the other hand,
is a defect in judgment. The biblical 
conception remained closer
to the concrete truth of the sexed and 
social being. The conception stemming 
from the New Testament resorbs the guilt
of the previous one and, at the risk of 
cutting itself off from
the coarse and intolerable truth of man 
that Judaism discloses,
offers displacements of it that are 
perhaps elaborations—communital, 
logical, esthetic ones. On the one 
hand, we find the
truth of the intolerable; on the other, 
displacement through
denial for some, through sublimation 
for others.

AVOWAL: CONFESSION
Omologeo and martireo, I acknowledge 
and I bear witness: in those
terms Christians confess, hence avow 
their faith in Christ, as
they will later their trinitary faith. 
Already Christ had "confessed" in this 
way before Pontius Pilate. The avowal 
of faith
is thus from the very start tied to 
persecution and suffering.
This pain, moreover, has wholly 
permeated the word "martyr," giving it 
its basic, ordinary meaning, that of 
torture rather
than testimony. Speech addressed to the 
other, not sinful speech
but the speech of faith, is pain; this 
is what locates the act of
true communication, the act of avowal, 
within the register of
persecution and victimization. 
Communication brings my most
intimate subjectivity into being for 
the other; and this act of
judgment and supreme freedom, if it 
authenticates me, also
delivers me over to death. Is this to 
say that my own speech,

130

... QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

all speech perhaps, already harbors in 
itself something that is
mortal, culpable, abject?
No dogma predicates it. One will have 
to wait for Freud to
bring out the heterogeneous aspect of 
drives, or simply the
negativity to which any discourse is 
prey. But the practice of
confession, upon the whole, does 
nothing else but weigh down
discourse with sin. By having it bear 
that load, which alone
grants it the intensity of full 
communication, avowal absolves
from sin and, by the same stroke, 
founds the power of
discourse.
We owe that invention, the whirling 
wherein the Christian
cleavage is resolved in the order of 
discourse, to an Egyptian
hermit, Anthony the Abbot—the same one 
who fascinated
Flaubert. In 271, while preaching to 
his brethren, he declared:
"Let everyone of us take note of and 
write down his acts and
feelings, as if he were to apprise 
other people of them . . . Just
as we shall never fornicate in the 
presence of witnesses, if we
write down our thoughts as if to make 
them known to others,
we shall abstain from obscene thoughts 
for fear of being found
out." Foundation of asceticism and very 
explicitly of sexual
repression, the speech addressed to the 
other ushers in judgment, shame, and 
fear. Pachomius (290-346) took up the 
same
point: "It is greatly wrong not to let 
the state of one's soul
immediately be known to a man practised 
in spiritual discernment." Following on 
bewailing, prayer or atonement, 
confession, which is often integral to 
them—especially in the early
days of Christianism or in its fervent 
practices—nonetheless
displaces the stress of the act of 
penance to the needs of an other,
a wise man. Consequently, the necessity 
of speaking in order
to topple sin into the Other becomes 
more obvious.
First set aside for monks, later spread 
to Celtic and Frankish
lands, the practice is extended to the 
laity only in the thirteenth
century, by decision of the Fourth 
Lateran Council. There were
discussions, divergences, sectarianism. 
How does one confess?
Who may do it? What is forgiven? And so 
forth. Such questions
will not detain me. But I am concerned 
with the ultimate interiorization of 
sin within discourses, by the final 
postulate that
does away with an offense because of 
its enunciation before the
One. An enunciation that amounts to a 
denunciation.

FELIX CULPA: SPOKEN SIN. DUNS SCOTUS
Little by little, acts of atonement, of 
contrition, of paying one's
debt to a pitiless, judging God, are 
eclipsed by the sole act of
speech. One slides over from the 
judicial to the verbal. Duns
Scotus, the logician, is at the heart 
of this shift, which amounts
to a spiritual revolution, as important 
no doubt as Christ's
verdict to the effect that the impure 
was not outside but inside
of man. Acknowledgment and absolution 
count for everything,
sin has no need for actions in order to 
be remitted. Duns Scotus
writes: "One who . . . wishes to 
receive the sacrament. . . and
who at the moment when those words are 
spoken wherein lies
the efficacy of the sacrament (in quo 
scilicet est pis sacramenti istius)
offers no obstacle on account of 
willing a mortal sin, that one
shall receive penitential grace, not by 
virtue of merit . . . but
by virtue of the covenant with God who 
resolved to be present
at his sacrament."8 An acknowledgment, 
a covenant with the
one who absolves, thanks to the words 
of an other in the name
of the Other—and lust, erroneous 
judgment, fundamental abjection are 
remitted—not suppressed, but subsumed 
into a
speech that gathers and restrains.
Is this harassment? Or jubilation? It 
is owing to speech, at
any rate, that the lapse has a chance 
of becoming fortunate; felix
culpa is merely a phenomenon of 
enunciation. The whole black
history of the Church shows that 
condemnation, the fiercest
censorship, and punishment are 
nonetheless the common reality
of this practice. For only on the 
fringes of mysticism, or in rare
moments of Christian life, can the most 
subtle transgression
of law, that is to say, the enunciation 
of sin in the presence of
the One, reverberate not as a 
denunciation but as the glorious
counterweight to the inquisitorial fate 
of confession. This marginal 
potentiality of spoken sin as fortunate 
sin provides an
anchorage for the art that will be 
found, resplendent, under all
the cupolas. Even during the most 
odious times of the Inquisition, art 
provided sinners with the opportunity 
to live, openly
and inwardly apart, the joy of their 
dissipation set into signs:
painting, music, words. "And these 
signs shall follow them
that believe; in my name shall they 
cast out devils; they shall
speak with new tongues" (Mark 16:17; 
emphasis added).

132

... QUI TOLLIS PECCATA MUNDI

On this peak of discourse, power no 
longer belongs to the
judge-God who preserves humanity from 
abjection while setting aside for 
himself alone the prerogative of 
violence—the
violence of separation as well as of 
punishment. Power henceforth
belongs to discourse itself, or rather 
to the act of judgment
expressed in speech and, in less 
orthodox and much more implicit 
fashion, in all the signs (poetry, 
painting, music, sculpture) that are 
contingent upon it. If such signs do 
not do away
with the necessity for confession, they 
do spread out the logic
of speech even to the most inaccessible 
folds of significance.

To be mistaken about the rhythm of a 
sentence is to be mistaken about
the very meaning of that sentence.
Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil

The world of illusions—the world of 
religions—brings to light
or embodies the prohibition that has us 
speak. Thus, it gives
legitimacy to hatred if it does not 
invert it into love. Embodying,
legitimizing—today we are too aware of 
their techniques to
yield to them. The worlds of illusions, 
now dead and buried,
have given way to our dreams and 
deliriums if not to politics
or science—the religions of modern 
times. Lacking illusions,
lacking shelter, today's universe is 
divided between boredom
(increasingly anguished at the prospect 
of losing its resources,
through depletion) or (when the spark 
of the symbolic is maintained and 
desire to speak explodes) abjection 
andpiercing laughter.
Conclusively and publicly—for a broad 
audience—Celine
anchors the destiny of literature in 
the latter territory, not that
of the Death of God but a reassumption, 
through style, of what
lies hidden by God.
We are thrown into a strange state when 
reading Celine.
What is involved goes beyond the 
content of the novels, the
style of the writing, the author's 
biography or his indefensible
political stands (fascist, 
anti-semitic); the true "miracle" of
Celine resides in the very experience 
of one's reading—it is
fascinating, mysterious, intimately 
nocturnal, and liberating by
means of a laughter without complacency 
yet complicitous.
Nearly twenty years after his death, 
close to half a century after

134

CELINE: NEITHER ACTOR NOR MARTYR

the publication of Journey to the End 
of the Night, how, where,
and why does this Celinian universe 
challenge us so vigorously?
I do not find within it the delightful 
interlacing of Proustian
sentences, which unfold my memory and 
that of my language's
signs down to the silent, glowing 
recesses of an odyssey of
desire deciphered in and through the 
fashionable wordliness of
his contemporaries. I do not come out 
of it shaken to the point
of exaltation, of dizziness (a torment 
that some flatten into
monotony), as happens when the Sadean 
narrative machine
unveils, beneath the power of terror, 
the playful reckoning of
sexual drive coiled up in death. I do 
not draw from it the
stainless, serene, nostalgic beauty of 
Mallarme's always already
antiquated arabesque; of Mallarme who 
could convert the paroxysms of a 
funereal psalm into the elliptic 
markings of a
convoluted language. I do not encounter 
in it the black, romantic rage of 
Lautreamont who chokes classicism in a 
fiendish
laugh; nor the volleys of Artaud's 
rhythmical suffering where
style performs its function of 
metaphysically transporting the
body to the place of the Other, both 
being ransacked, but
leaving a trace, a gesture, a voice.
Celine's effect is quite other. It 
calls upon what, within us,
eludes defenses, trainings, and words, 
or else struggles against
them. A nakedness, a forlornness, a 
sense of having had it;
discomfort, a downfall, a wound. What 
people do not acknowledge but know they 
have in common; a base, mass, or
; anthropological commonality, the 
secret abode for which all
i masks are intended. Celine has us 
believe that he is true, that
he is the only authentic one, and we 
are ready to follow him,
deeply settled in that end of night 
where he seeks us out; we
forget that he can show it to us only 
because he stands elsewhere—within 
writing. Actor or martyr? Neither one 
nor the
other, or both at the same time, like a 
true writer who believes
in his wiles. He believes that death 
and horror are what being
is. But suddenly, and without warning, 
the open sore of his
very suffering, through the contrivance 
of a word, becomes
haloed, as he puts it, with "a 
ridiculous little infinite"1 as tender
and packed full of love and cheerful 
laughter as it is with bitterness, 
relentless mockery, and a sense of the 
morrow's im-

possibility. Even your cherished 
abjection belongs to the realm
of a puppet show's gang [guignol's 
band] and the enchantment is
postponed until some other time . . . 
[f eerie pour une autrefois]
As for jouissance, be it of language, 
meaning, or transcendence
grasped from within, in pure literary 
style, you are barking up
the wrong tree . . . All that remains 
is the tune, without notes

to hoist itself up into Man with a 
capital letter but to join, body!
and language being mingled, those 
intermediate states, those,
non-states, neither subject nor object, 
where you is alone, singular, 
untouchable, unsociable, discredited, 
at the end of a night
that is as particular as it is 
incommensurable.
When reading Celine we are seized at 
that fragile spot of our
subjectivity where our collapsed 
defenses reveal, beneath the
appearances of a fortified castle, a 
flayed skin; neither inside nor
outside, the wounding exterior turning 
into an abominable interior, war 
bordering on putrescence, while social 
and family
rigidity, that beautiful mask, crumbles 
within the beloved
abomination of innocent vice. A 
universe of borders, seesaws,
fragile and mingled identities, 
wanderings of the subject and
its objects, fears and struggles, 
abjections and lyricisms. At the
turning point between social and 
asocial, familial and delinquent, 
feminine and masculine, fondness and 
murder.
We have already traveled through such 
areas—with defilement, abomination, and 
sin—beneath other skies, under other
protections. For the contemporary 
reader, they seem more
poignant in Celine than in the 
reminiscences, archaeological
upon the whole, that I cited earlier; 
this is due no doubt to the
fragility, with Celine, of the ideal or 
prohibiting judging
agency, which, in other times and 
cultures, borders on abjection
or indeed causes it to come into being. 
Here, that agency becomes ambiguous, 
grows hollow, decays, and crumbles; it 
is
a fleeting, derisory, and even idiotic 
illusion, which is yet upheld. Neither 
divinity nor morality, it is the 
watermark that
remains in the darkness and horror of 
night, allowing such a

136

CELINE: NEITHER ACTOR NOR MARTYR

night, nevertheless, to be written. 
Agency of exploded, thunder-blasted 
meaning, and yet sparkingly there: a 
scription.
Neither revolutionary challenge, which 
would assume belief in
a new morality, class, or humanity; nor 
skeptical doubt, which
always takes shelter, in the last 
resort, within the self-satisfaction of 
a critical stance that leaves the doors 
of progress open.
It is rather a black explosion, having 
the power of a devastating
implosion, an anarchic one if you wish, 
provided one rectifies
at once: there is no anarchy of 
writing, since writing orders,
regulates, and legislates. What? 
Nothing, perhaps, and perhaps
not. What object? Could it be the 
ab-ject?
Is it vice? Is it playacting or 
possibly perversion? Better than
that. A yearning after Meaning together 
with its absorption,
ingestion, digestion, and rejection. 
Power and sin of the word.
Without God, without any One other than 
that which lies under
the polylogue of the Celinian 
symphony—a music, a web, a
lacework. A whirl of abjection that can 
be borne, that can be
written only if it can also provide 
itself with objects, hateful of
course, the most stable ones, the most 
archaic, ensuring the
most precise, the most certain 
jouissance.
His adhering to Nazism, ambivalent and 
paltry as that action
was, is not one that can be explained 
away. It becomes integrated as an 
internal necessity, as an inherent 
counterweight,
as a massive need for identity, a 
group, a project, meaning;
thus it crystallizes the objective and 
illusory reconciliation between,
on the one hand, an ego that drowns in 
the whirl of its objects
and its language and, on the other, the 
identifying prohibitions—an unbearable, 
untenable, disintegrating one, which
causes him to be. His fascination with 
Jews, which was full of
hatred and which he maintained to the 
end of his life, the simpleminded 
anti-Semitism that besots the 
tumultuous pages of the
pamphlets, are no accident; they thwart 
the disintegration of
identity that is coextensive with a 
scription that affects the most
archaic distinctions, that bridges the 
gaps insuring life and
meaning. Celine's anti-Semitism, like 
political commitment,
for others—like, as a matter of fact, 
any political commitment,
to the extent that it settles the 
subject within a socially justified

CELINE: NEITHER ACTOR NOR MARTYR 137

illusion—is a security blanket. A 
delirium, to be sure, but one
whose social unfolding and multiple 
rationalizations are well
known; a delirium that literally 
prevents one from going mad,
for it postpones the senseless abyss 
that threatens this passing
through the identical, which is what 
scription amounts to.
His novels are realistic out of social 
constraint and, to some
extent, out of hatred;2 or rather they 
are legends, but also music,
dance, emotions, notes edged with 
silence—Celine's texts, and
this has been said only too often, are 
in bad form. Obviously,
one could read them by following the 
meanderings of the narrative, which, 
similar to those of well-known 
storytellers, is
picaresque or biographical at the 
beginning (Journey to the End
of the Night, Death on the Instalment 
Plan), then bursts its shell
and veers toward the polyphony of North 
and Rigadoon after
going through the carnival of Guignol's 
Band and he Pont de
Londres ["London Bridge"]. And yet a 
more specifically
Celinian feature is the drowning of 
narrative in a style, which,
from the Journey to Rigadoon, is 
gradually decanted; more and
more incisive, precise, eschewing 
seduction in favor of cruelty,
it is nevertheless haunted by the same 
concern—to touch the
intimate nerve, to grab hold of emotion 
by means of speech,
to make writing oral, in other words, 
contemporaneous, swift,
obscene. If that scription is a 
struggle, it is not won through
the expedient of Oedipal 
identifications generated by narrative
but through much deeper, more remote, 
and riskier probes.
Such probings, which tamper with 
vocabulary and syntax, relate the 
Celinian experience not to the 
novelist's verisimilitude
but to the inhumanity of the poet. An 
inhumanity that resides
in his very words; it is hence most 
radical, affecting mankind's
ultimate guarantee—language. In the 
wake of a black lineage
where Lautreamont or Artaud is 
inscribed, inhumanity discovers its 
appropriate themes, contrary to all 
lyrical traditions,
in horror, death, madness, orgy, 
outlaws, war, the feminine
threat, the horrendous delights of 
love, disgust, and fright.
Those are the themes, then, that I am, 
seemingly, going to
deal with in Celine. My reading, 
however, will not be a thematic one, 
first because of the very themes 
involved, but mainly

138

CELINE: NEITHER ACTOR NOR MARTYR

because, with Celine, such themes 
always assume at least a
double stance between disgust and 
laughter, apocalypse and
carnival.
Any fictional theme is, by definition, 
a challenge to the single
signified since it is a polyvalent 
signified, a "blasting of selfhood" 
(Georges Bataille). This is no doubt so 
because the fantasies that nourish such 
a theme converge on that impossible
focus, that unthinkable "origin" 
constituted by the scene of
scenes, the so-called primal scene.3 In 
another connection,
Bakhtin has shown that there is a 
fundamental dialogism, a
basic bivalence in any speech, word, or 
utterance in novels
stemming from carnivalesque tradition 
(Dostoyevsky's novels,
for instance).4 Celine brings to its 
paroxysmal climax this technique, which 
constitutes a way of being. Can one 
tell whether
the bombing of Hamburg, as written by 
Celine, represents the
height of tragedy or the most cavalier 
mockery of mankind?
Does Titus van Claben's combination of 
orgy, murder, and fire
express the horror of a sickening human 
condition, or is it an
extravagant farce about a few cookies 
who are more or less
smart? To the carnival's semantic 
ambivalences, which pair the
high and the low, the sublime and the 
abject, Celine adds the
merciless crashing of the apocalypse. 
And end-of-the-world flavor exudes from 
that disgust for mankind in the midst 
of the
Second World War—and this with or 
without politics. An invisible sword of 
judgments weighs on Celine's universe 
more
heavily than God (a permissive one, 
upon the whole) did on
medieval carnival and its altogether 
Christian sequels, Dostoyevsky 
included. It is the invisible sword of 
a non-existent God—
neither transcendency nor Man, no 
capital letters, save the place,
"Nothing shall have taken place but the 
place" (Mallarme). A
sword that is perhaps not even an 
instance but a distance—an
ideal and a superego, a being-removed, 
which cause horror to
exist and at the same time take us away 
from it, grip us with
fear and by that very fright change 
language into a quill, a
fleeting and piercing one, a work of 
lace, a show of acrobatics,
a burst of laughter and a mark of death.
• • • one has to be more than somewhat 
dead in order to be truly a wisecracked.
That's it! You have to have been 
removed from the spot.5

CELINE: NEITHER ACTOR NOR MARTYR

As for me, alas, all I have is a kind 
of cavalier outlook on instincts
and life—I am neither overindulgent nor 
sensual. I am "removed,"
serious, classic in my 
delirium—constructive—That is perhaps 
where
I come close to the great—but that's 
all . . .6

SUFFERING AND HORROR
One can be a virgin with respect to 
Horror as one is virgin toward
Voluptuousness. *
Celine, Journey to the End of the Night

THE NARRATIVE AS CACHE FOR SUFFERING
"In the beginning was emotion . . . ," 
Celine often repeated
in his writings and interviews. Reading 
him, one has the impression that in the 
beginning was discomfort.
Suffering as the place of the subject. 
Where it emerges, where
it is differentiated from chaos. An 
incandescent, unbearable
limit between inside and outside, ego 
and other. The initial,
fleeting grasp: "suffering," "fear," 
ultimate words sighting the
crest where sense topples over into the 
senses, the "intimate"
into "nerves." Being as ill-being.
Celine's narrative is a narrative of 
suffering and horror, not
only because the "themes" are there, as 
such, but because his
whole narrative stance seems controlled 
by the necessity of
going through abjection, whose intimate 
side is suffering and
horror its public feature.
This much is becoming known after so 
much "Russian formalism" but also after 
so many biographies confided on the
couch: a narrative is, all in all, the 
most elaborate attempt, next
to syntactic competence, to situate a 
speaking being between
his desires and their prohibitions, in 
short, within the Oedipal
triangle.
But not until the advent of 
twentieth-century "abject" lit*On est 
puceau de l'Horreur comme on est puceau 
de la Volupte.

SUFFERING AND HORROR

I4I

erature (the sort that takes up where 
apocalypse and carnival
left off) did one realize that the 
narrative web is a thin film
constantly threatened with bursting. 
For, when narrated identity is 
unbearable, when the boundary between 
subject and
object is shaken, and when even the 
limit between inside and
outside becomes uncertain, the 
narrative is what is challenged
first. If it continues nevertheless, 
its makeup changes; its linearity is 
shattered, it proceeds by flashes, 
enigmas, short cuts,
incompletion, tangles, and cuts. At a 
later stage, the unbearable
identity of the narrator and of the 
surroundings that are supposed to 
sustain him can no longer be narrated 
but cries out or
is descried with maximal stylistic 
intensity (language of violence,
of obscenity, or of a rhetoric that 
relates the text to poetry).
The narrative yields to a crying-out 
theme that, when it tends to
coincide with the incandescent states 
of a boundary-subjectivity
that I have called abjection, is the 
crying-out theme of sufferinghorror. In 
other words, the theme of 
suffering-horror is the
ultimate evidence of such states of 
abjection within a narrative
representation. If one wished to 
proceed farther still along the
approaches to abjection, one would find 
neither narrative nor
theme but a recasting of syntax and 
vocabulary—the violence
of poetry, and silence.
"DECAY IN ABEYANCE . . . "
Everything is already contained in the 
Journey: suffering, horror,
death, complicitous sarcasm, abjection, 
fear. And the pit where
what speaks is a strange rent between 
an ego and an other—
between nothing and all. Two extremes 
that moreover change
places, Bardamu and Arthur, and give an 
aching body to that
endless synthesis, that journey without 
end; a narrative between
apocalypse and carnival.
It all began just like that. I had said 
nothing. I hadn't said a word. It
was Arthur Ganate who started me off. 
(J, 3)
Everything was mine that evening; it 
all belonged only to me. I had
the moon to myself and the village and 
a tremendous sense of fear.
J. 34)

.

.

142 SUFFERING AND HORROR

It is of men, and of them only, that 
one should always be frightened.(J,11)
Did none of them [the letters from the 
general to the colonel] contain
the order to put an immediate stop to 
this abomination? Was he not
being told by HQ that there was some 
misunderstanding,, some abominable 
mistake? (J, 10; emphasis added in all 
four excerpts)
Obviously the atrocities of war are 
given as the true cause
of fear. But its violent, 
quasi-mystical permanence raises it from
the level of political or even social 
contingency (where it would
be due to oppression) to another level; 
fear becomes a token of
humanity, that is, of an appeal to love.
Don't imagine it's as easy as all that 
to fall asleep once you have begun
to disbelieve everything, mostly 
because of all the times you have
been frightened. (J, 199-200)
. . . you'll surely finish up by 
finding out what it is that frightens 
all
these bloody people so, and it's 
probably somewhere at the farther
end of the night. (J, 218-219)
... an emotion of exceptional trust, 
which in timid people takes the
place of love. (J, 227)
And also:
Fear can't be cured, Lola, (f, 61)
Just as,
When one's in this world, surely the 
best thing one can do, isn't it,
is to get out of it? Whether one's mad 
or not, frightened or not. (J,
56)
Or the mother who is nothing but sorrow 
stuffed with fear:
It was as if she was afraid of this 
cause for sorrow; it was full of 
sinister
things that she did not understand. (J, 
93)
And finally, quite as expected, this 
definition of outmoded art,
the kind that Celine breaks away from 
in order to assert the
truth of art as unacknowledged fear:
Happiness on earth would consist of 
dying with pleasure, in the midst

SUFFERING AND HORROR

of pleasure . . . The rest amounts to 
nothing at all, it's a fear one
daren't confess to, it's just so much 
Art. (J, 378)
In the beginning was a war that caused 
me to be in a state
of fear. In that original state, "I" am 
weak, frightened in the
face of awesome threats. Are there any 
means of defense? Scouring is the only 
one; by a reduction, not a 
transcendental but a
mystical one. Mystical: a word that 
Celine uses (in connection
with Lola's body he speaks of "a 
mystical adventure in anatomical 
research" (J, 50); as to the people one 
fears, "Their
actions no longer have that foul 
mystical power over you,
weakening you and wasting your time" 
(J, 59)). It amounts
to setting up not a bevond but two 
terms, face to face, each
judging the other, in turn, and both 
reducing in the end to the
same abjection. On one side, what is 
base; on the other, the
speech that I hold forth and that has 
me in its hold. Nature, the
body, the inside. Facing the spirit, 
others, appearances. Truth
being on the base side; a barren side, 
without makeup, without
seeming, rotten and dead, full of 
discomfort and sickness,
horror.
And the truth of this world is to die. 
(J, 199)
. . . but she [his mother] remained a 
good deal short of the dog's level
because she believed what they told her 
when they took me away.
The dog at least believes only what it 
knows by sense of smell. (J,
92)

Entirely naked, all you have in front 
of you is really only a wretched,
pretentious beggar swollen with 
conceit, with difficulty getting out
its inane babble in one style or 
another. (J, 334)
It didn't matter that it was really 
Nature; she considered me just as
disgusting as Nature herself, and 
that's what was such an insult to
her. (J, 395)
And this, about a writer:
... a man, whether he's a relation of 
theirs or not, is nothing but
arrested putrescence. (J, 425)
And yet what brings into existence this 
truth of horror and

143

144 SUFFERING AND HORROR

sickness, of weakness and downfall, is 
its confrontation with
the other term—the powerful, rich, and 
feared: "There are two
of you together."
But when one's weak, the thing that 
gives one strength is stripping
those one fears of the slightest 
prestige that one may still tend to
accord them. One must teach oneself to 
see them as they are, as worse
than they are, that is. One should look 
at them from all points of
view. This detaches you, sets you free 
and is much more of a protection than 
you can possibly imagine. It gives you 
another self, so
that there are two of you together. (J, 
59)
Nevertheless, in this fascinating 
confrontation during a merciless war, 
both end up on the same side, united in 
abomination;
then language turns into slobber, 
conversation into defecation,
it is the end of the night.
When you consider, for instance, the 
way in which words are formed
and uttered, human speech fails to 
stand up to the test of all these
appalling trappings of spittle. The 
mechanical effort we make in speaking 
is more complicated and arduous than 
defecation. (J, 334-335)
Is there not some solution, some 
salvation on account of this
equal sign between the elevated and the 
base? Celine's universe
is provided, in spite of it all, with 
an outside, intermittently and
held in compassionate mockery. 
Sometimes women are the
ones who, for their part, do not 
experience repulsion, but only
imagine it, perhaps. Another solution 
sometimes crops up—
impossible, condemned, and just as 
antiquated—which would
amount to keeping to the Idea, a single 
idea, guarantee and
counterweight to overbearing abjection. 
And finally, the path
that Celine chose for himself; to stay 
within horror but at a
very slight distance—an infinitesimal 
and tremendous one,
which from the very heart of Celine's 
essential abomination,
distinguishes and inscribes sublime 
love for a child or, in a space
beyond sexuality and analogous to it, 
writing as sublimation.
The brink: women.
Women are all housemaids at heart. But 
perhaps she imagines this
repulsion rather than feels it; that is 
my remaining consolation. Perhaps
all that I suggest to her is that I am 
filthy. Perhaps I am an artist in
that line. (J, 74)

SUFFERING AND HORROR

Redemptive Unity: an Idea that is one, 
picayune, and impossible.
My own ideas, the ideas I had, roamed 
loose in my mind with plenty
of gaps in between them; they were like 
little tapers, flickering and
feeble, shuddering all through life in 
the midst of a truly appalling,
awful world. [. . .] but even so there 
was never any chance of my
managing, like Robinson, to fill my 
head with a single idea, some
really superb idea that was definitely 
stronger than death ... (J,
504-505)

Finally the sublime, with its two 
modest faces. On the one
hand:
Clearly Alcide could rise to sublime 
heights without difficulty, could
feel at home there; there was a fellow 
who hobnobbed with the angels
and you would never have guessed it. . 
. . Almost without noticing
he had given three years of hardship, 
the annihilation of his wretched
life in this tropical monotony, . . . 
(J, 160)
On the other, the musical sublimation 
that most people miss
and that Celine will aim at throughout 
his writing:
There was nothing left for him to 
sublimate; he just wanted to go
away, to take his body somewhere else. 
There was no harmony in
him, so that to be through with it all 
he had to upturn everything like
a bear. (J, 426)
Being sorrowful isn't all; there ought 
to be some way of starting up
the music again, of discovering a 
further poignancy ... (J, 504)
ACCOUNTS OF DIZZINESS
But the most normal solution, 
commonplace and public at the
same time, communicable, shareable, is 
and will be the narrative. Narrative as 
the recounting of suffering: fear, 
disgust,
and abjection crying out, they quiet 
down, concatenated into
a story.
In the shooting sharpness of his 
suffering, Celine will look
for a story, a verisimilitude, a myth. 
That is how we get the
famous story of his head wound suffered 
during the First World
War, a wound whose gravity, most 
biographers agree, was
greatly exaggeratedly Celine who lays 
stress on it both when

145

146 SUFFERING AND HORROR

speaking to newspapermen and in his 
writings. Aching in his
head, his ear, his arm. Dizziness, 
noises, buzzings, vomitings.
Even attacks, the onslaughts of which 
make one think of drugs
or epilepsy. Already in Death on the 
Instalment Plan:
I've had it since the war. Madness has 
been hot on my trail ... no
exaggeration . . . for twenty-two 
years. That's quite a package. She's
tried a million different noises, a 
tremendous hullabaloo, but I raved
faster than she could, I screwed her, I 
beat her to the tape. [. . .] My
great rival is music, it sticks in the 
bottom of my ear and rots . . .
it never stops scolding ... [. . .] I 
am the organs of the Universe
... I provide everything, the ham, the 
spirit, and the breath . . .
Often I seem to be worn out. My 
thoughts stagger and sprawl . . .
I'm not very good to them. I'm working 
up to the opera of the deluge.
[. . .] I am the Devil's stationmaster. 
[. . .] The gate of hell in your
ear is a little atom of nothing.1
Suffering speaks its name 
here—"madness"—but does not
linger with it, for the magic of 
surplus, scription, conveys the
body, and even more so the sick body, 
to a beyond made up
of sense and measure. Beyond the 
narrative, dizziness finds its
language: music, as breath of words, 
rhythm of sentences, and
not only as metaphor of an imaginary 
rival where the voice of
the mother and of death is hiding:
A beautiful shroud embroidered with 
tales—that's what the Pale Lady
wants. (D, 41)
The narrative, on the other hand, is 
always umbilicated to
the Lady—fascinating and abject object 
of the telling.
Triggered by the mother, moreover, on 
the rough seas of
the English Channel, one of 
literature's most abominable scenes
of abjection or nausea is unleashed. We 
are far removed here
from buzzing pain that rises musically. 
The body is turned
inside out, sent back from deep within 
the guts, the bowels
turned over in the mouth, food mingled 
with excretions, fainting spells, 
horrors, and resentments.
Mama collapses against the rail . . . 
She vomits herself up again, all
she's got... A carrot comes up . . . a 
piece of fat. . . and the whole
tail of a mullet . . . (D, 124)

SUFFERING AND HORROR 147

We're half drowned in the flood. We're 
squashed into the toilet bowl
. . . But they never stop snoring . . . 
I don't even know if I'm dead
or alive. (D, 126)
Human beings caught flush with their 
animality, wallowing
in their vomit, as if to come closer to 
what is essential for
Celine, beyond all "fancies": violence, 
blood, and death. Never
perhaps, not even with Bosch or the 
blackest aspect of Goya,
have human "nature," on the other side 
of the "sensible," the
"civilized human," or the divine been 
opened up with so much
cruelty, and with so little 
satisfaction, illusion, or hope. This
is the horror of hell without God: if 
no means of salvation, no
optimism, not even a humanistic one, 
looms on the horizon,
then the verdict is in, with no hope of 
pardon—the sportful
verdict of scription.
Le Pont de Londres ("London Bridge") is 
no less revealing of
that war with the bowels, promoted this 
time to manly rank
(general Des Entrayes has already 
appeared in Journey), of suffering 
within:
It's a dizzy spell! ... A sickly 
feeling! ... I am a prey to fever!
... I sit down! ... I close my eyes 
hard ... I can still see . . . red
and white . . . colonel Des Entrayes! . 
. . raised on his stirrups! . . .
That's a show from my memories ... I am 
back in the war! . . .
Jesus! . . . I'm a hero again! ... So 
is he! Aren't memories beautiful!
. . . Just for that I stretch out on 
the sofa . . . I'm having my attack!
. . . Again I see Des Entrayes, my 
beloved colonel! . . . Mad he sure
wasn't! . . . He was raised on his 
stirrups!... his cavalry sword ready
for action . . . raised! . . . flashing 
in the sun . . .2.'
In short a Schreberian suffering, which 
only humor and style
cause to tilt out of the accounts of 
the Freudian neuropath into
one of the most suggestive pages of 
contemporary literature.
SUFFERING AND DESIRE: A DEBILITY
There is no glory in this suffering; it 
is not an ode: it opens up
only onto idiocy. Debility is that 
ground, a permanent one with
Celine, where "intimate" suffering, 
both physical and psychic,
joins with sexual excesses. There, is 
nothing pornographic,

148

SUFFERING AND HORROR

nothing attractive or exciting in such 
a baring of instincts.
Caught on the black slope where desire 
founders in drive or
affect, where representations are 
blurred, where significations
vanish, this form of sex is an 
inebriation, another word for
debilitated suffering.
I had reached the limits . . . [. . .] 
Mimine!. . . no more hallucinations
for me ... I knew how they got to me 
... I had some experience
now . . . just a small bit of liquor . 
. . just a small glass was enough
. . . and then a friendly discussion . 
. . there's someone who contradicted me 
... I'd get excited . . . and that was 
it! . . . Always on
account of my head, it was written on 
my deferment card! . . . (P,
335)
All my aches are catching up with me . 
. . piercing me through and
through! . . . my forehead, my arms, my 
ears ... I hear the trains
that are heading for me! . . . filling 
my head with whistling and roars!
. . . I've had it, fuck that shit! . . 
. I'm going down! . . . I've got hold
of the railing . . . Just a bit dizzy . 
. . And here I am, quaking, in
front of her . . . Oh what a scare! . . 
. what a thrill! ...[•••] Does
she love me a little? . . . I'm asking 
myself. . . I ask myself again and
again when I'm with her . . . I'm 
getting so emotional! ... I really
don't know where I'm setting my feet! . 
. . I'm stumbling all over
... I can't see where I'm going . . . 
neither store windows or people
. . . not even sidewalks, I trip and 
bump ... I pick myself up, I am
ecstatic ... in the enchantment of her 
presence ...[...] I don't see
the GI who's hollering at me 'cause I'm 
stamping all over his plates
... or the conductor who's shaking me . 
. . who's pestering me in
my day-dream . . . (P, 137-138)
SCATOLOGY TURNED COMMONPLACE
The no man's land of dizziness that 
links suffering and sex gives
way to a disgust for decay or 
excretion; Celine talks about it
in the same neutral tone, in the same 
seemingly natural fashion,
as when he describes suffering or 
debility. Granted that his
medical practice has something to do 
with it. But one detects
a cold glee, an aloof taming of 
abjection that remind one less
of (sadomasochistic) perversion than of 
certain moments in the
painful life of the fortified castle 
(see above, pp. 53-55) as well
as of the most "borderly" rites of 
basic religions.

SUFFERING AND HORROR

It is as if Celine's scription could 
only be justified to the
extent that it confronted the "entirely 
other" of signifiance; as
if it could only be by having this 
"entirely other" exist as such,
in order to draw back from it but also 
in order to go to it as
to a fountainhead; as if it could be 
born only through such a
confrontation recalling the religions 
of defilement, abomination,
and sin. As for the narrative, put out 
of joint by the workings
of that device, it is both shattered 
and punctuated in its simply
biographical and logical continuity by 
such clusters of fascination; what is 
disconnected regains its coherence in 
the permanence of abjection.
That obsession refers back to decay, 
whether it be recalling
the excrement discovered by the unhappy 
father as the other
side of his child's success in school 
(D, 76) or else the anal
dirtiness that fixates Ferdinand's 
interest in the swarming interior of a 
body, about which he will not have to 
ask whether
it is male or female.
I never wiped myself properly, I always 
had a sock coming to me
. . . and hurried to avoid it ... I 
left the can door open so as to hear
them coming ... I shat like a bird 
between two storms . . . (D, 69)
Decay: privileged place of mingling, of 
the contamination of
life by death, of begetting and of 
ending. Its high point may
perhaps be found in an apocalyptic 
description of earth rotted
away by the maggots of the scholar 
Courtial des Pereires: the
scientific experiments of the inventor 
of Genitron, far from
perpetuating life, succeed only in 
transforming a food, potatoes,
into an unbearable stench ("corpses or 
potatoes"), and in rotting
the very stones.
One big desert of rot! . . . f. . .] 
OK, OK, the spirit's fermenting!
[. . .] You want to know what 
putrefaction is? You want me to tell
you? It's all the shit we have to put 
up with . . . (D, 515-516)
And yet it is the human corpse that 
occasions the greatest
concentration of abjection and 
fascination. All of Celine's narratives 
converge on a scene of massacres or 
death—the Journey,
beginning with the First World War, had 
pointed the way,
Rigadoon and North, spread out over a 
Europe laid waste by the
Second, deepen and sustain the 
fixation. It is true that contem-

149

150

SUFFERING AND HORROR

porary times are conducive to such 
representations, rife with
slaughter as they are, and Celine 
remains the greatest hyperrealist of 
the period's massacres. But we are far 
removed from
news accounts of war, even of the most 
horrible kind. Celine
tracks down, flushes out, and displays 
an ingrained love for
death, ecstasy before the corpse, the 
other that I am and will
never reach, the horror with which I 
communicate no more
than with the other sex during 
pleasure, but which dwells in
me, spends me, and carries me to the 
point where my identity
is turned into something undecidable. 
There is a vertiginous,
apocalyptic, and grotesque evocation of 
ecstasy before death
in one of the final scenes of Death on 
the Instalment Plan. Father
Fleury, having become mad, dismembers 
Courtial's corpse:
He sticks his finger into the wound . . 
. He plunges both hands into
the meat ... he digs into all the holes 
... He tears away the soft
edges . . . He pokes around . . . He 
gets stuck . . . His wrist is caught
in the bones . . . Crack! . . . He tugs 
... He struggles like in a trap
. . . Some kind of pouch bursts . . . 
The juice pours out... it gushes
all over the place ... all full of 
brains and blood . . . splashing . . .
(D, 560)
INGRAINED CARNAGE
The scription of Celine draws its night 
and its ultimate support
from death as the supreme location of 
suffering, from the aggressivity that 
provokes it, from the war that leads to 
it. Abjection is edged with murder, 
murder is checked by abjection.
Men don't have to be drunk to make 
havoc of heaven and earth. With
them carnage is ingrainedl It's a 
miracle they survive when you consider
the time they have spent cutting 
themselves down to nothing. They
think only of nothingness, lousy 
customers, future criminals! They
keep seeing red everywhere! Might as 
well skip it, or that would be
the end of poetry . . . (P, 406)
Certainly, but not of Celine's texts, 
quite the contrary.
One is reminded of attempted murders, 
of many killings—
of the old Henrouille, of Robinson (in 
the Journey); of constant
brushes with death in "London Bridge" 
where "scientific" ex-

SUFFERING AND HORROR

periment is mixed, as in a baleful 
carnival, with deadly risks
and murderous violence in taverns, 
orgies, and subways. Think
of Titus' death rattle in Guignol's 
Band; the heinous outcries
over his dying body, struggling between 
the bodies of two
women, the customer and the maid, 
tokens of an impossible
orgy that has shifted into murder:
He's lying there in his silks full of 
his filth ... his vomit. . . he's still
gurgling! ... his eyes are swiveling . 
. . they get rigid . . . revulse
. . . Ah! it's horrible to watch! . . . 
and then poof! He turns crimson!
So livid just a second ago! . . . He's 
swelling up with big gobs . . .
his mouth's full ... he makes an effort 
. . .3
Like a crisis in his illness, his 
asthma.
When that got him! what a panic! . . . 
Should've seen his eyes then!
. . . the horror that seized him! (G, 
155)
The apocalyptic murder scene reaches 
its climax when drugs
are added to the orgy, as in the fire 
sequence of Guignol's Band.
I see a big battle scene! . . . It's a 
vision! ... a movie! . . . Ah! it's
going to be something out of the 
ordinary! ... in the darkness above
the tragedy! . . . There's a dragon 
munching them all! . . . tearing
their behinds out . . . their guts . . 
. their livers [. . .] I can see you,
you pain in the ass! [. . .] I'm going 
to slit the skunk's nostrils! . . .
I don't like homos! . . . What if I cut 
off his organs? ... ah, that'd
be something! I'm thinking about it! . 
. . I'm thinking about it! . . .
(G, 172-173)
And then the vision of murder turns 
sublime, the murderous
apocalypse shows its lyrical side 
before everything founders
into vomit, money swallowed as ultimate 
food, reincorporated
excrement; and fire, actually 
apocalyptic, devastates everything,
after Claben's murder by Boro and 
Celine-the-pain:
. . . and everything starts turning 
around the globe! like a merry-goround 
... the water lamp . . . I'm seeing 
things inside it! I see garlands
. . . I see flowers! I see daffodils! 
[. . .] I tell Boro! ... He belches
at me! . . . He's between Delphine and 
the old^guy! . . ■ They're still
at their dirty game! . . . there in the 
big bed! ... They're making me
sicker! . . . The guy who guzzled all 
his dough! ... He doesn't feel
sick! ... all the money "in his bag! . 
_ he's satisfied . . . (G, 178)

SUFFERING AND HORROR

FERDINAND THE PAIN: A MURDERER
Ferdinand the Pain, the one who speaks 
in the first person, is
here one of the main protagonists of 
the murder. It is he again,
"I," who, in Guignol's Band, throws his 
persecutor, Matthew,
under the subway. That scene sets in 
motion the merry-goround of persecutor 
and persecuted and changes the previous
sequence's visionary representation of 
murder into a more dynamic X-ray of the 
murderous process. A true underground
kingdom ruled by death drive finds its 
natural place in the
bowels of the subway, the Celinian 
equivalent of Dante's hell.
Murder as underground lining of the 
unclean-thinking being.
My blood turns! ... I stop breathing! 
... I stop moving! ... I stand
there hypnotized ... he looks at me! 
... I look at him! Ah! but I'm
thinking! . , . I'm thinking fast! . . 
.It's the midget! there against me!
. . . It's him! [. . .] It's getting 
ready by itself! . . . my scheme . . .
I concentrate . . . concentrate . . . 
Not a word . . . calm and collected
...[...] We hear the train roaring . . 
.it's coming! . . . there in the
darkness ... in the hole ... at my 
right . . . Good! . . . Good!
. . . Good! . . . the train's 
approaching. It's roaring fiercely, 
crashing
in, swelling up . . . Brrr! Brrroom . . 
. Good! Good! Good! . . . It's
near ... I look at Matthew opposite 
...[...] Bop! I hit him with
my ass! the midget! up in the air! . . 
. The thunder lets loose, passes
over him! (G, 219-220)
THE SECOND WORLD WAR
It is in war, however, that the 
apocalyptic unfurling of aggressivity 
and death matches and goes beyond what 
is found
in Goya or Bosch. An abominable war in 
the Journey but one
soon traveled through; a sinister and 
carnivalesque war in
"London Bridge" and Guignol's Band.
I'm the murderer, doc! ... I killed ten 
of em! ... I killed a hundred!
... I killed a thousand! . . . I'll 
kill all of 'em next time! . . . Doc,
send me back! ... I belong at the 
front! . . . a-off to war! (G, 229)
Without the war it is hard to imagine a 
Celinian scription;
the war appears to trigger it off, to 
be its very condition; it
plays the role of Beatrice's death, 
which leads to the Vita Nuova,

SUFFERING AND HORROR

or of Dante's avoidance of death, which 
initiates the first canto
of the Divine Comedy. The trilogy in 
which the Second World
War's horror unfolds, From Castle to 
Castle, North, and Rigadoon,
best captures the wound that Celine 
never ceases to palpate,
from the individual's to society's. In 
the political and social
fresco, overflowing with rejections and 
sarcasms directed
against a political position that in 
other respects Celine seems
to endorse (a point I shall return to), 
with betrayals, escapades,
massacres, bombings, and destruction, 
the most destructive
aggressivity suddenly shows its 
abominable, sickly side, within
an infernal jouissance—History's abject 
motive. The site of
Celine's scnption is always that 
fascinating crest of 
decomposition-composition, 
suffering-music, and 
abomination-ecstasy.
. . . let them rot, stink, ooze, end up 
in the sewer . . . they keep
wondering what they can do in 
Gennevilliers . . . easy! fertilize the
fields! ...[...] the true sense of 
History . . . and what we've come
to! jumping this way! . . . whoops! and 
that way!. . . the death dance!
impalements! purges! vivisections! . . 
. twice tanned hides, smoking
. . . spoiled, skulking voyeurs, let it 
start all over again! guts ripped
out by hand! let's hear the cries, the 
death rattles ... a national
orgasm!4
Let me recall, in connection with the 
apocalyptic music of
the trilogy, the bombing of Hamburg 
where, amidst the din,
the stench, and the chaos, the frenzy 
of abjection turns into
sinister beauty:
these green and pink flames were 
dancing around . . . and around
. . . and shooting up at the sky! . . . 
those streets of green . . . pink
. . . and red rubble . . . you can't 
deny it . . . looked a lot more
cheerful ... a carnival of flames . . . 
than in their normal condition
. . . gloomy sourpuss bricks . . . it 
took chaos to liven them up
... an earthquake ... a conflagration 
with the Apocalypse coming
out of it! (R, 130)
I've told you what it was like, three 
four times the size of Notre Dame
...[...] the light came from up top ... 
the crater hole ... the
effect, I repeat, was like an enormous 
nave of solid clay •-.[...]
Hamburg had been destroyed with liquid 
phosphorus ... the Pompei
deal ... the whole place had caught 
fire, houses^, street, asphalt, and

15 3

154 SUFFERING AND HORROR

the people running in all directions . 
. . even the gulls on the roofs
...(R,191)
The sacred and history, Notre Dame and 
Pompei, meaning
and law, in the tremendous unveiling of 
suffering and death of
the Second World War, give birth to 
their gruesome hidden
side. And the all-powerful obverse of a 
fragile culture is, in the
eyes of Celine, the truth of the human 
species; for the writer,
it is the point of departure of 
scription as the laying bare of
meaning. Granted that Celine's vision 
is an apocalyptic one,
that it bears mystical strains in its 
fixation on Evil as the truth
of impossible Meaning (of the Good, of 
the Law). And yet, if
apocalypse means, etymologically, a 
vision, it must be understood as the 
contrary of revelation of philosophical 
truth, as the
contrary of aletheia. There is no 
apocalyptic being, scored, fainting, 
forever incomplete, and incapable of 
setting itself up as a
being, bursting among the flames or 
reverberating amid the
clamors of universal collapse. Celine 
does not exhibit a philosophical 
"evil." Moreover, no ideological 
interpretation can be
based on his revelation: what 
principle, what party, what side,
what class comes out unscathed, that 
is, identical to itself, from
such a thorough critical conflagration? 
Suffering, horror, and
their convergence on abjection seem to 
me more adequate as
marks of the apocalyptic vision 
constituted by Celine's scription.

A NARRATIVE? NO, A VISION
It is indeed a vision, to the extent 
that sight is massively summoned to 
play a part in it, broken up by the 
rhythmic sound
of the voice. But it is a vision that 
resists any representation,
if the latter is a desire to coincide 
with the presumed identity
of what is to be represented. The 
vision of the ab-ject is, by
definition, the sign of an impossible 
ob-ject, a boundary and
a limit. A fantasy, if you wish, but 
one that brings to the wellknown 
Freudian primal fantasies, his 
Urfantasien, a drive overload of hatred 
or death, which prevents images from 
crystalizing as images of desire and/or 
nightmare and causes them
to break out into sensation (suffering) 
and denial (horror), into

SUFFERING AND HORROR

a blasting of sight and sound (fire, 
uproar). Apocalyptic vision
could thus be the shattering or the 
impossibility not only of
narrative but also of Urfantasien under 
the pressure of a drive
unleashed by a doubtless very "primal" 
narcissistic wound.
When Celine locates the ultimate of 
abjection—and thus the
supreme and sole interest of 
literature—in the birth-giving
scene, he makes amply clear which 
fantasy is involved: something horrible 
to see at the impossible doors of the 
invisible—the
mother's body. The scene of scenes is 
here not the so-called
primal scene but the one of giving 
birth, incest turned inside
out, flayed identity. Giving birth: the 
height of bloodshed and
life, scorching moment of hesitation 
(between inside and outside, ego and 
other, life and death), horror and 
beauty, sexuality
and the blunt negation of the sexual.
. . . and I've delivered babies, 
fascinated, I might say, by difficult
passages, visions of the narrows. . . 
those rare moments when nature
lets you observe it in action, so 
subtle, the way it hesitates, then makes
up its mind . . . life's critical 
moment, as it were ... all our theater
and literature revolve around coitus, 
deadly repetition!. . . the orgasm
is boring, the giants of the pen and 
silver screen with all the ballyhoo
and the millions spent on advertising . 
. . have never succeeded in
putting it across . . . two three 
shakes of the ass, and there it is . . .
the sperm does its work much too 
quietly, too intimately, the whole
thing escapes us . . . but childbirth, 
that's worth looking at! . . .
examining! ... to the millimeter! (R, 
195-196)
At the doors of the feminine, at the 
doors of abjection, as I
defined the term earlier, we are also, 
with Celine, given the
most daring X-ray of the "drive 
foundations" of fascism. For
this indeed is the economy, one of 
horror and suffering in their
libidinal surplus-value, which has been 
tapped, rationalized, and
made operative by Nazism and Fascism. 
Now neither theoretical reason nor 
frivolous art, stirred by epiphenomena 
of desire
and pleasure, has been able to touch 
that economy. Such desiring art could 
only offer a perverse negation of 
abjection,
which, deprived in other respects of 
its religious sublimation
(especially considering the state of 
bankruptcy of religious codes
between the two wars, most particularly 
in Nazi and Fascist
circles), allowed itself to be seduced 
by the Fascist phenomenon.

155

I56 SUFFERING AND HORROR

Drieu La Rochelle provides us with the 
very epitome of such
a literature. Its solidary reverse is 
an art of the repressed, traditionally 
versified and patriotic, that of moral 
resistance, resolute and limited at the 
same time. But is any realist (or 
socialistrealist) literature up to the 
horrors of the Second World War?
Celine, for his part, speaks from the 
very seat of that horror,
he is implicated in it, he is inside of 
it. Through his scription
he causes it to exist and although he 
comes far short of clearing
it up, he throws over it the lacework 
of his text: a frail netting
that is also a latticework, which, 
without protecting us from
anything whatsoever, imprints itself 
within us, implicating us
fully.

THOSE FEMALES WHO CAN
WRECK THE INFINITE
It would be hard to find a woman who is 
neither a bitch nor a ninny—
if so, she will be witch and fey.
Celine, Letter to Milton Hindus

THE TWO-FACED MOTHER
The mother takes up her place, so it 
goes once again, at the
central location of the writer's 
feminine showroom. But here,
explicitly and in very significant 
fashion, she is split in two.
Ideal, artistically inclined, dedicated 
to beauty, she is, on the
one hand, the focus of the artist's 
gaze who admits he has taken
her as a model.
I am the son of a woman who repaired 
ancient lace. It so happens that
I have a collection of it, quite rare, 
the only thing that I have left, and
I am one of the rare men who can tell 
cambric from Valenciennes,
Valenciennes from Bruges, and Bruges 
from Alen^on. I can tell fine
quality very well. Very very well. I 
don't have to be trained. I know.
And likewise I recognize the beauty of 
women and also that of animals.
Very well. I am an expert in this.1
Or, in more allusive fashion, but still 
linking writing, women,
and lace:
I am not an artist but I have a good 
memory for flowers . . . Janine
. . . Marie-Louise ...[•••] what's 
written plain, that isn't much, it's
transparency that counts ... the 
lace-work of Time as they say
2

And yet, neither mother nor 
grandmother, as Celine's novels

I58

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

conjure them up, are characters whose 
splendor is without shadows. Writing, 
for instance, originates in the 
grandmother—
"she taught me to read a little," "she 
herself wasn't very good
at it," and even, "I can't say she was 
tender or affectionate, but
she didn't talk much, and that was 
really great" (D, 63). The
love that he bears her is an awkward, 
modest love, tinged with
a chaste and guilt-laden reserve, 
contrasting with the excess and
horror characteristic of Celinian 
feeling. Moreover, it is at the
moment of death that, embarrassed by 
his childlike clumsiness,
he dares to manifest his love.
We felt kind of ashamed . . . kind of 
guilty . . . We didn't dare to
move . . . for fear of spoiling his 
grief . . . Mama and all of us cried
with our heads on the table . . . (D, 
100)
The other maternal image is tied to 
suffering, illness, sacrifice,
and a downfall that Celine, so it 
seems, readily exaggerated.
This kind of motherhood, the 
masochistic mother who never
stops working is repulsive and 
fascinating, abject.
As long as it was lousy work, as long 
as there was plenty of sweat
and heartache, she was satisfied . . . 
That was her nature ...[...]
She was really attached to her horrible 
fate . . . (D, 295)
We had already encountered that in the 
Journey:
It was as if she was afraid of this 
cause for sadness; it was full of
sinister things which she did not 
understand. She believed really that
small fry like herself were meant to 
suffer all the time, that that was
their role on earth, ... (J, 93)
It is a wretched representation, 
degraded even by the relentlessness 
with which her limping leg was 
emphasized, "It was
my mother's legs, the skinny one and 
the fat one" (D, 54), and
by the exceeding poverty Celine would 
have us believe prevailed in Passage 
Choiseul. To what end is castration 
embodied
in the mother? Is it the representation 
of an abiding blame, the
appeasement of a precocious 
narcissistic wound? Or a way of
expressing a love that only the weak 
can receive without those
who utter it being threatened?
The theme of the two-faced mother is 
perhaps the representation of the 
baleful power of women to bestow mortal 
life.

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

159

As Celine put it, the mother gives us 
life but without infinity:
She did all she could to keep me alive, 
I just shouldn't have been born.
(D, 55)
. . . those females can wreck the 
infinite . . . (D, 46)
I have already mentioned that 
birth-giving is, for Celine, the
privileged object of scription. In its 
miscarriage, too, in abortion, the 
writer discovers, quite naturally, the 
basic fate and
abominable tragedy of the other sex. He 
evokes this insuperable
drama in the Journey when sexual 
pleasure is drowned in a pool
of blood during a confrontation between 
the sensual daughter
and her jealous, deadly mother (J, 
259ft).
LIFE? A DEATH
Let me recall that Celine devoted his 
doctoral dissertation (1924)
on Ignaz Semmelweis to the infection 
that develops during
childbirth—puerperal fever. Very much 
unlike what one would
expect in a medical treatise, quite 
novelistic, this work can be
deciphered as Celine's identification 
with the Hungarian doctor
practicing in Vienna. A foreigner, a 
solitary, on the fringe of
the profession, insane in the end, 
persecuted by everyone, the
inventor of obstetric hygiene had what 
it takes to fascinate not
only those suffering from obsessions 
but, more deeply, those
who fear decay and death at the touch 
of the feminine. He
advocated that a doctor wash his hands 
after having been in
contact with corpses in order not to 
contaminate the women
whose deliveries he might be attending 
to—and this during the
Napoleonic era, before the discovery of 
microbes. Semmelweis
noted, in fact, that puerperal fever is 
the result of the female
genitalia being contaminated by a 
corpse; here then is a fever
where what bears life passes over to 
the side of the dead body.
Distracting moment when opposites 
(life/death, feminine/masculine) join 
in order to constitute what is probably 
more than
a defense fantasy against the 
persecuting power of the mother:
a panic hallucination of the inside's 
destruction, of an interiorization of 
death following the abolishment of 
limits and dif-

l60

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

ferences. The remedy?—Once more it 
involves separating, not
touching, dividing, washing. The third 
party, the doctor, must
be an agent not of communication but of 
isolation, thus providing the lay 
counterpart to religious abominations, 
excisions,
and purifications. It is an impossible 
role: prey to violent hallucinations, 
Semmelweis rushes to a corpse, cuts, 
cuts himself,
and becomes infected. Like a woman 
giving birth? The agent
turning victim? The doctor failing to 
escape the fate of the sick
mother, pledged to death? Celine 
follows step by step the painful 
experience of the doctor poet who was, 
too, the author of
a dissertation written in quite 
literary style ("The life of
plants"—"twelve pages of poetry"); he 
comments, as if he were
not referring to the Viennese doctor 
but to himself, the novelist
to be, "the world and dance were 
leading him to femininity."
This dissertation is in fact a journey 
to the dark portals of life,
where the woman in childbed succumbs to 
infection, life to
death, women's fever to the delirious 
hallucinations of man,
reason to enigma. What attracts Celine, 
of all the old enigmas
of science, is the one lying at the way 
out or the way in for
woman, confusing inside and outside, 
life and death, feminine
and masculine—and that is certainly 
more than a metaphor. His
dissertation is a preparation for the 
Journey to the End of the Night
in that it discusses in nearly explicit 
fashion, although within
the constraint of "scientific" 
repression, the enigma constituted,
for reason, by the feminine. It will 
have been necessary, so it
seems, for Celine's reason to come up 
against that obstruction
to make it possible, beyond the 
foulness of abjection, for his
two unyielding protagonists to 
appear—death and words.
The Celinian universe remains 
dichotomous; without a third
party, or because of the latter's 
failure, two terms rise up, facing
each other, Woman and Lover, Sex and 
Corpse, Woman in
childbed and Doctor, Death and Words, 
Hell and the Writer,
the Impossible and Style.
Beyond those few colorful 
embellishments, there were on the path
of infection only death and words . . .3
• • • hell begins at the doors of our 
Reason.4

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

One does not explain everything with 
facts, ideas, and words. There
is, in addition, everything we do not 
know and shall never know.5
As for the writer, his task is to be 
more than a doctor—he
is to be not only the one who 
separates, a father, as it were,
but also the one who touches, the son 
and the lover, even taking
the place of the feminine. The One and 
the Other and by that
very token neither the One nor the 
Other, a person Removed.
This is a very particular solution to 
the Oedipal situation; the
subject does not become normalized 
through triangulation of
the neurosis; he does not appear in the 
dual fear of narcissistic
relationship in the absence of a third 
party; he covers the three
positions at the same time—trinity, 
three dots, from one identity the 
other, no identity, rhythm, rotation, 
rigadoon.
Giving life—snatching life away: the 
Celinian mother is
Janus-faced, she married beauty and 
death. She is a condition
of writing, for life given without 
infinity aspires to find its
supplement of lacework within words; 
she is also the black
power who points to the ephemeral 
nature of sublimation and
the unrelenting end of life, the death 
of man. The paranoid
woman, another Celinian character, is 
perhaps a projection of
the danger of death prompted within the 
speaking being by his
perception of that part of himself he 
fantasies as maternal and
feminine. Let me point out that the 
double aspect of the mother
in Celine's writing defines it as 
scription of death on the one
hand, and as revenge on the other. It 
is a being pledged to death
who narrates stories to the Lady, but 
by the same token he
rehabilitates his mother. For everyday 
reasoning, things seem
reversed; but in Celine's text, it is 
she who wants him dead,
he who causes her to live.
A beautiful shroud embroidered with 
tales—that's what the Pale Lady
wants. (D, 41)
My teeth are gone! but I remember a few 
ditties . . . mother! A tiny
second all life long ... a lustful 
woman mother wasn't ... it passed
her by . . . like myself, her son . . . 
what a sacrifice! [. . .] Oh but
I'll write, I will, full of hatred as I 
am, I'll avenge everyone, ass riven
to my seat, their historical names 
engraved in gold ... in the Sainte

l6l

162

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

Chapelle! . . . the writer's power is 
so weak! weak poet, weaker than
anything! Look out, all you bulky 
Herculeses wearing togae! I'll see
that your names are written in gold! 
(F, 301)
COURTLINESS AFFRONTED
There is courtly code in the amorous 
code of Celine. Explicit
at times, it is above all constantly 
present in the background
as modesty and lyricism. Without it 
abjection could not exist,
could not be spoken as our other, as 
the nocturnal reverse of
the magnificent legend. The 
enchantments of the Celinian ballets 
("without music, without anybody, 
without anything" as
the subtitle [to Feerie pour une autre 
fois] makes clear) are an
ineffectual attempt at staging an 
archaizing idealization where
the feminine ideal persists, no matter 
what the personality of
the female characters, in the sublime 
body of the ballerina. But
one remembers, more abruptly yet, those 
pages in Death on the
Instalment Plan where Ferdinand 
confesses to Gustin Sabayot his
intention of writing a thoroughly 
chivalrous legend about the
adventures of Gwendor the Magnificent. 
Immediately afterward he relates that 
enchanted knightly romance to a 
perverted
minor, Mireille, before she becomes the 
object of his hardly
courtly pornographic and sadistic 
desires. (D, I36ff). This episodic 
character and the isolated sequence set 
apart from the
thread of a narrative without 
continuity are nevertheless 
symptomatic. The conjunction of 
opposites (courtliness-sadism) is
again encountered in all of Celine's 
feminine characters. To
varying degrees, such ambivalence seems 
to show that genital
fear can be kept within bounds by 
idealization as well as by the
unleashing of partial drives 
(sado-masochistic, 
voyeurist-exhibitionist, oral-anal).
Molly, the most sublime, does not 
escape such a pattern.
Doubtless a prostitute, dispensing her 
charms in a "clandestine
whorehouse," she nevertheless has none 
of the destitution that
is the lot of Joyce's Molly Bloom—one 
without illusions and
commonplace to the point of sickly 
obscenity. To the contrary,
Celine's Molly benefits from angelic 
idealization; the modesty
and lyricism of his writing endow her 
with the enchanted ex-

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

istence of the great white-draped 
priestesses of ancient Phallic
myths. Could the devalorization of sex, 
dissociated, parcelized,
marginalized, and in the final analysis 
degraded, as we saw it
in the theme of suffering-horror, be 
the condition for a phallic
idealization of Woman? There is at any 
rate in Celine a precise
place where abjection vanishes and 
becomes veneration:
Good, admirable Molly, I should like 
her, if she ever reads these lines
of mine, to know for certain that I 
have not changed towards her,
that I love her still and always shall, 
in my own way; that she can
come to me here, whenever she may care 
to, and share my bread and
my furtive destiny. If she is no longer 
beautiful, ah, well, no matter!
The more's the pity, we'll manage 
somehow, I've kept so much of
her beauty with me still, so warm, so 
much alive, that I've enough
for both of us, and it will last 
another twenty years, long enough to
see us through. (J, 235)
Elisabeth Craig, to whom the Journey is 
dedicated, seems to be
the main referent for that confession 
touched with emotion;
Celine wrote Milton Hindus about her:
What a genius that woman had! I never 
would have amounted to
anything without her. What a mind! what 
subtlety . . . What pantheism, at the 
same time painful and mischievous.6
MY CHILD, MY SISTER
The aura of amorous idealization seems 
to appear as soon as
one can ward off the fear aroused by 
the sexual desire that
women are assumed to have for a man. 
This perhaps explains
why those the writer allows himself to 
win over, or even to
love, are either lesbians or women 
playing the role of a sister.
Molly is probably the most dazzling 
representation of a sisterly
friendship-love. A variant of it, more 
openly incestuous or
perverse, is provided by Virginia in 
"London Bridge." But
Guignol's Band already gave us an 
angelic foretaste of it, to a
rhythm of dancing harlequins:
Pert brisk little girl with golden 
muscles! . . . Keener health! . . .
whimsical leap from one end of our 
troubles to the other! At the very
beginning of the world the fairies must 
have been young enough to
have ordained only extravagance . . . 
The world at the time was all

163

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

whimsical marvel and peopled with 
children, all games and trifles and
whirls and gewgaws! A spray of giggles! 
. . . Happy dances! . . .
carried off in the ring! (G, 33)
A carnivalesque counterpart to Lewis 
Carroll's Alice, Virginia is the child 
who enables one to imagine angels in the
feminine. This has the phantasmatic 
advantage of deferring the
abject encounter with feminine sex, for 
in the body of a childdancer thus 
presented to one's gaze, touch, 
hearing, and scent,
the sexual component being everywhere 
is actually nowhere.
I'd like to talk to her about 
quicksilver again ...[...] She can't 
stay
put . . . she leaps, pirouettes like an 
imp ... in the room all around
me . . . What beautiful hair! . . . 
what gold! . . . what a filly! . . .
[. . .] She speaks to me . . . it's 
bird-language ... I don't understand
everything ...[...] I wouldn't have 
eaten! ... I would have died
a dainty person! . . . preferring it 
all for Virginia's sake! ... (P, 36)
Even more significant is this 
paradisiacal vision in the midst
of a world of vagrants and orgies, of 
drunken revels and
demons:
... I touch, I brush against the 
fingers of my pixie! of the adored
marvel . . . Virginia! ... I no longer 
dare, everywhere about us
... a thousand flakes of fire are 
flying . . . flitting . . . graceful 
fire
streamers all over the trees! . . . 
from one branch to the next . . .
Joyful sparkling daisies, corollas 
showing . . . blazing camellias . . .
scorching wistaria ... to be tossed to 
the skies! . . . among the blasts
of music . . . the fairies' chorus . . 
. the tremendous humming of their
voices . . . the secret of the smiles' 
charm . . . That's the way of the
feast of fire in Paradise! (P, m)
That mischievous child evocation is 
also a link between Ferdinand and the 
girl's uncle, a character both feared 
and cheated
by the narrator; one can thus locate 
within denied homosexuality the 
giddying reality of the relation to the 
girl where
Ferdinand, from one identity to 
another, from one sex to the
other, ends up losing his mind.
I'm a bit dizzy ... I am again in front 
of her, shaking all over . . .
Ah, what a fright! . . . what a thrill 
. . . (P, 138)
• • • before childplay is swallowed up 
in a loving embrace, in the rain

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

165

... I cover her 'with caresses, I lick 
her like a dog ... I lap her up
... I suck the water from the tip of 
her nose ...[...] from time
to time there's an awful taste! A 
behavior worthy of a lout! Hooligan's
jumble, obscenity! . . . debauchery! I 
would've layed my Virginia!
(P, 163)
The pixie's loving brother is on the 
verge of becoming an
incestuous father; all that holds him 
back is the fear of others
and the circumstances, always somewhat 
persecutive.
One will note the twisted aspect of 
incest: the sister becomes
her brother's daughter, and that allows 
the man, in this context,
to be a brother or father but to keep 
his mother untouched and
to continue his war with the other man, 
the real brother of the
object of his desire. Finally, pregnant 
Virginia obviously proffers the very 
image of the undecidable situation 
within such a
carnivalesque world. A feeling of 
compassion and a desire to
escape henceforth accompany, for the 
narrator, a paternity that
is as magical as it is grotesque. "I am 
in the cage of her happiness" (P, 367) 
contrasts with "I was fed up with my 
destiny!
[. . .] Stolen destiny! Another name 
for God" (P, 290). And
now it turns out that the "satyr for 
little girls" behaves like a
hero. "My pregnant daughter, my angel! 
my cherub! my life!
Oh I wouldn't want them to touch her! 
... I would kill them
all! shit!" (P, 466). Next he 
surrenders to another character,
female this time, a Delphine out of the 
London slums. She takes
up the end of the novel, conjuring up 
Lady Macbeth and murder, while all the 
participants in the carnival sail off 
on an
indefinite journey, in a book that 
abruptly comes to an end at
London Bridge with the confession of 
the brother-father's buffoonery: "I'm 
the buffoon at present! A whole way of 
life! Me
that's got care and circumspection!" 
(P, 490). Carnival covers
up incest. From one identity to an 
other, unfinished like the
novel itself, abjection is resorbed in 
the grotesque: a way of
living it from the inside.
THE PHALLUS* VOYEUR
Idealization of the child's form is in 
fact only one aspect of
Celine's pagan enthusiasm for 
femininity separated from rea-

166

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

son, language, and the symbolicity 
that, in his eyes, alters,
socializes, and sexualizes it. If he is 
fond of women on occasion,
he is so as sensualist-voyeur of a pure 
form, a beauty that lets
itself be conquered only by the gaze, 
one made up of lines,
muscles, rhythm, and health. A 
ballerina is the most perfect
example of it, preferably a 
foreigner—the opposite of the
mother language, without language if 
need be, all sensitivity
and acrobatics.
And a pagan on account of my absolute 
adoration of physical beauty,
of health—I hate sickness, penance, 
morbidity—[. . .] madly in love—
I say, in love—with a four-year-old 
girl at the height of gracefulness
and blond beauty and health—[. . .] 
America! the feline nature of its
women! [. . .] I would give all of 
Baudelaire for an Olympic swimmer!
There's not a penny's worth of the 
rapist in me—but I am a voyeur
to the death!7
And again:
I have always liked women to be 
beautiful and lesbian—very pleasing
to look at, I wouldn't get tired out by 
their sexual summonses!
[. . .] me, a voyeur—that suits me! [. 
. .] and an enthusiastic consumer, just 
a bit but very quiet.8
American dancers, who find their 
clearest phantasmatic
expression in the comedy L'Eglise, best 
embody that absolute
phallus of unaltered beauty: a feminine 
body in the purest state
of nature, free from any other (man or 
language). L'Eglise is
a play with neither stylistic nor 
dramatic value, but it is interesting 
in that it stages the Celinian fantasy 
of feminine nature,
which is here the object of a strong 
endorsement and contrasts
with the extreme poverty of blacks and 
the bureaucracy of the
Jews. "Long live American women who 
despise me"—such
is the basic message of that feminine 
worship, which is less
suggestive of satyrism than of morbid 
relish.
There remains for the playwright 
confronted with the enchantment of 
dance the jouissance of being the waste 
cut off
the phallus. Janine performs that 
transposition of parts that
allows Bardamu to be more than passive, 
threatened with death:
she shoots at him with a revolver while 
the splendid Elizabeth
is dancing.

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

167

It is not reason but phallic instinct 
that writes the law; Woman
is its representative in a life where 
henceforth, in spite of enchantment, 
murder dominates. The end of religion 
is no doubt
worship of Woman, and also penal 
colony. "Life, kiddo, is not
a religion, Janine [. . .]: it's a 
penal colony! Mustn't try to deck
the walls like a church."9
CARNIVAL—IN HYSTERICAL FASHION, 
SOCIETY—IN
PARANOID FASHION
After it has forsaken the veil of 
childhood and femininity without other 
(sex), beauty is no longer pleasing in 
Celine's eyes.
An unbridled woman then arises, eager 
for sex and power,
nevertheless a grotesque and sorry 
victim in her raw violence
that extends from drunken revels to 
murder. As early as the
Journey, Celine displayed her colors by 
means of a seemingly
harmless series of women who turned 
into farce the tragedy
experienced by soldiers in the war. One 
remembers Lola and
her apple fritters, Musyne and her 
violin, tough and bloodthirsty 
nurses—"War goes straight to their 
ovaries ..." (J, 87).
But it is especially with prostitutes 
and nymphomaniacs, who
are nevertheless tackled with 
fascination if not with a certain
amount of sympathy, that we are 
presented with a wild, obscene, and 
threatening femininity. Their abject 
power is none
the less kept in the background owing 
to a shift in the narrator's
vision, which simultaneously gives of 
that power an image of
downfall, abject poverty, and senseless 
masochism. One will
recall Sosthene's wife, in "London 
Bridge," nymphomaniac
and battered. Even though demoniacal, 
such femininity is nonetheless in the 
position of a fallen demon who finds 
being only
with reference to man:
War! war! always war! There was nothing 
except bang bang bang that
could awaken them just a bit . . . It 
had to keep going, the whole
shebang, shaking heaven and earth . . . 
so as to open up their peepers
again ... a whore without men is a 
flabby thing. (P, 428)
The pinnacle of this compound of 
abomination and fascination, sex and 
murder, attractiori and repulsion, is 
probably

168

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

Gioconda, the prostitute in Guignol's 
Band, who makes good
use of her name by defiling it in her 
hysterical spells, with the
bleeding sore of her loving body 
reduced to a wound in the
ass.
Ah, it's a big challenge! . . . And 
stamps her heel! . . . she's a fury!
. . . it's a dance! ... a trance! . . . 
her fingers all nerves! . . . her
hands quivering all over! crackling, 
spluttering! . . . small . . . small
. . . tiny . . . still smaller . . . [ 
. . . ] The devil's tail! ... the tail's
caught! . . . trr! . . . rebounds! (G, 
82-83)
She trips! . . . Tumbles! sprawls! It's 
Gioconda! in a package! ... in
her cotton . . . bandages! . . . she 
gets up, she screams, she's awful!
. . . starts blaming right away! . . . 
there it goes . . . she hoists herself
up, clings to the bar! ... A fury! 
She's choking with effort. . . she's
suffocating . . . she ran through the 
whole neighborhood . . . looking
for us! (G, 114)
She was pulling at her dressings, she 
was chucking them all around,
all over the floor, cotton, bandages, 
shreds . . . Boy, what laughing
in the joint! (G, 115)
A dark, abominable, and degraded power 
when she keeps
to using and trading her sex, woman can 
be far more effective
and dangerous when socialized as wife, 
mother, or career
woman. The unbridling is then changed 
into crafty reckoning,
hysterical spells turn to murderous 
plots, extreme masochistic
poverty becomes a commercial triumph. 
While hysterical
woman is merely a carnival puppet, 
under a law she perversely
attempts to get around, the paranoid 
woman becomes successful
by making of herself the expression of 
a murderous sociality.
The whole procession of wives, or, 
better still, of more or less
overbearing widows, controlling the 
circulation of wealth, children, and 
loves, in the Journey or in Death on 
the Instalment Plan,
contributes to such a view of the 
feminine. And yet we find
in the two Henrouilles, the 
daughter-in-law murdering her
mother-in-law (through an intercessory 
man, of course) and
the mother-in-law profiteering until 
the end of her unscathed
life, the best embodiment, in the 
Journey, of calculated abjection;
they represent the feminine that saves, 
hoards, foresees, settles

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

169

down wretchedly, living from hand to 
mouth, but doing it all
through extreme measures of hatred and 
murder. One would
have to rate the two Henrouille women 
close to Lady Macbeth—who, under the 
apparent narcissistic essence of the 
feminine, bares death drive. They are 
derisive and ghoulish representations 
of a feminine paranoia that is the more 
unbridled,
the more coldly calculated, as they 
have given up on all sexual
satisfactions.
Gioconda and Henrouille, in brief, are 
shown as the two
facets of an otherness that cannot be 
sublimated—the sexual
and the repressed, the marginal and the 
social. They are the
prototypes of an abject femininity 
that, for Celine, is capable
of neither music nor beauty; instead, 
mistress and victim, it
breaks out into the world of instincts 
where, as a naturally
successful paranoid, it craftily rules 
the social institutions (from
families to small businesses) where 
puppet-men, shabby men
are living.
The capable woman, the intellectual, 
does not escape being
grotesque either. If she does not share 
in the sordid craftiness
of an Henrouille or an Henrode, she is 
fated to prove the absurdity of reason 
(a masculine element) when it is 
sheltered in
a body that is feminine to boot. Such 
is the woman inventor,
the railroad company accountant; an 
unusual person who "decomposed water 
from the Seine with a diaper pin" (D, 
423),
but in fact she thought only of getting 
married—and got fleeced
by fancied suitors. There is thus only 
decay in this fallen, heartrending, 
murderous, dominating, and derisive 
femininity.
Women, you know, they wane by 
candle-light, they spoil, melt,
twist, and ooze! [. . .] The end of 
tapers is a horrible sight, the end
of ladies, too, . . . (F, 16)
And there you have the muse just as she 
is after two thousand
years of art and religion. A muse in 
the true tradition of the
lowly genres—apocalyptic, Menippean, 
and carnivalesque. The
pitiful power of the feminine, however, 
be it drive or murder,
is in fact unleashed only with the help 
of masculine degradation
or bankruptcy—a bankruptcy of the 
father and manly authority. Does that 
mean that this is the feminine from 
which scrip-

170

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

tion withdraws? Or, if you wish, is it 
from this feminine, defined as the 
other of sublimatory area, that 
scription, in a more
ambiguous fashion, draws its 
inspiration?
A CARTOON-LIKE FATHER
Auguste, the father, emerges out of a 
conjuring up of the primal
scene at the beginning of Death on the 
Instalment Plan, and all
through the novel he stands out as both 
the opposite and the
other self of the writer.
Later they closed the door . . . the 
door to their bedroom ... I slept
in the dining room. The missionaries' 
hymn came in over the walls
. . . And in the whole rue Babylone 
there was only a walking horse
. . . clop clop . . . that late cab . . 
. (D, 54)
Family quarrels, the most intimate and 
doubtless essential
elements in Celinian family life, 
reveal a petty clerk embittered
by unfulfilled dreams of becoming a 
merchant marine captain;
an artist on occasion, he draws, but he 
also tells stories in a
manner both fierce and harping. When 
mother and son argue
over the father's values, the polarity 
of this tragicomic figure
of a clown is clearly stated: "He was 
an artist at heart," and
"There was no lousier bastard in the 
whole universe" (D, 46,
47). Overwhelmed with fear ("He was 
building up to the next
outburst, the Deluge that wouldn't be 
long in coming," D,
64-65), obsessed with the passing of 
time ("He was always in
a temper anyway, because the time 
wouldn't pass," D, 62-63)
and with cleanliness (see D, 75-76), 
Auguste actually possesses
Clemence by beating her up (D, 67), 
demonstrates his manhood
by shooting off his revolver (D, 77), 
and cannot help imagining
persecutions and plots directed at 
himself in his mother-in-law's
talk (D, 79). While none of all that is 
basically alien to Ferdinand,
what brings them closest together is 
probably the art of storytelling. 
Auguste can describe the enchantment of 
the World's
Fair (D, 82), but he also keeps them 
breathless when telling
about the journey to England (D, 
129-130).
My father had style, elegance came 
natural to him. (D, 54)

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

But also:
My father distrusted his imagination. 
He talked to himself in corners.
He was afraid of being carried away . . 
. He must have been steaming
inside . . . (D, 59)
In the context of this ambivalent 
portrait, which definitely
leans toward caricature, it is quite 
significant that Celine would
ascribe to Auguste anti-Masonic and 
anti-Semitic feelings while
seeming to repudiate them (if only 
through the Oedipal context
of Death on the Instalment Plan) and 
accept responsibility for
them later on.
. . . he'd be stringing the beans . . . 
why wouldn't we turn on the
gas and all commit suicide? . . . My 
mother just sat there ... He
blamed it all on the Freemasons . . . 
and Dreyfus! . . . and all the
other criminals who were out to get us. 
(D, 101-102)
He was being persecuted by a whole 
carnival of demons ... He really
revved it up . . . He dragged everybody 
into it. . . Jews . . . schemers
. . . social climbers . . . And most of 
all the Freemasons . . . (D, 152)
Auguste-Laius reaches the utmost in 
degeneracy during his
scrap with Ferdinand, the violent 
andjerky description of which
is almost explicitly sexual:
He starts trembling again, his whole 
carcass is quaking, he's beside
himself. . . He clenches his fists. . . 
His stool is creaking and dancing
. . . He's winding up, he's going to 
lunge ... He comes back blowing
up my nose . . . more insults . . . 
more and more of them ... I feel
things coming up in me too . . . And 
the heat besides [. . .] I lift up
the big heavy machine ... I lift it way 
up. And wham! ... I give
it to him full in the face! . . . [ . . 
. ] I stumble, I charge with it . . .
I can't contain myself anymore . . . 
That does it, I've got to finish the
stinking bastard! (D, 316)
Is not this tale of the father's murder 
what Ferdinand is daydreaming about as 
he lifts his eyes to the ceiling and 
attempts
to find his way through a very personal 
narrative?
I see Thibaud the Minstrel . . . He's 
always in need of money. He's
going to kill Joad's father . . . Well, 
at least that will be one father

171

172

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

less in the world ... I see splendid 
tournaments on the ceiling . . .
I see lancers impaling each other . . . 
(D, 44)
If the murder of the father provides a 
key to enchantment,
it is accompanied not only by guilt but 
also by a tremendous
sense of panic before a woman thus 
freed of any curb, hold,
or master. One of the sources of 
Celinian abjection no doubt
lies in the bankruptcy of the fathers. 
They represent a seeming
of power barely sufficient for the 
frightened son who is writing
to rise up against a universe forsaken 
by infinity, which only
thus appears true to him. The 
writer-son does not spare Auguste, 
including even his illness—attacks, 
nightmares, exhaustion, delirious 
states, cold towels wrapped around his 
head; the
reader knows that Ferdinand, too, is 
going through the same
hell. The father, moreover, is from the 
beginning a mixture of
childishness and ridiculous manhood:
. . . with a chubby round nose like a 
baby's over an enormous mustache. He 
rolled his eyes ferociously when he was 
angry. He never
remembered anything but vexations. (D, 
53)
The ideal figure is nevertheless not 
completely absent; it is
the uncle—the maternal one, of course; 
it is Edouard, the devil's
own Luck, the hope of righteous 
families. But the positive
glimmer that filters in, ironical as it 
may be, among men that
are mere marionettes, is not without 
danger. There we have
Courtial des Pereires, who solidly 
embodies manhood, paternity, and 
science combined; identifying the 
paternal with the
rational, he leads them together to the 
pinnacle of grotesqueness, to the heart 
of catastrophe. A universalist, 
familialist,
collectivist, and rationalist, Des 
Pereires, as his name suggests,
speaks to the "Anguished Fathers of 
France" and establishes the
"Renovated Familistery for the Creation 
of a New Race" (D,
989). He is, of course, a disciple of 
Auguste Comte in whose
wake he founds "The Friends of Pure 
Reason"; for fairgound
carnivals he substitutes the 
"Agricultural Revolution"; he even
includes astronomy in his "Explanations 
for Families"; he is an
inventor, to be sure, and head of a 
Genitron, a genetic research
institute, as it were, before anything 
of the sort existed; he is
a Utopian on occasion, having devised 
his Polyvalent Cottage,

FEMALES WHO CAN WRECK THE INFINITE

173

a house that is flexible, expanding, 
adapted to any size family;
with all this, Des Pereires clearly 
represents the modernistic,
socializing, and rationalistic excesses 
of social conformism,
which, in the final analysis, is always 
familial. In less sociological
fashion, he embodies the castration of 
modern man, of the
technocratic father, universal dummy 
and ultimate token of a
world lacking in jouissance and able to 
find being only in abjection. In this 
sense, Des Pereires and Gioconda, like 
the Henrouille women, are perhaps the 
privileged representations of
contemporary post-Catholic destiny for 
mankind bereft of
meaning. Representations of the 
paternal and the maternal, of
the masculine and the feminine, in a 
society on the threshold
of fascist totalitarianism.

"OURS TO JEW OR DIE"
Enthusiasm involves a lot of mad 
raving—Alas! Freud certainly raved
a great deal—but our ravings now seem 
to involve solely political
fanaticism—that's even more 
ridiculous—I know. I was caught up
in it.
Celine, Letter to Milton Hindus

LOGICAL OSCILLATIONS: AN ANARCHISM
Doubtless contradictory, hotheaded, 
"raving" if you wish,
Celine's pamphlets (Mea Culpa, 1936, 
Bagatelles pour un massacre,
1937, L'Ecole des cadavres, 1938, Les 
Beaux Draps, 1941), in spite
of their stereotyped themes, carry on 
the wild beauty of his
style. Isolating them from the whole of 
his writings constitutes
a defense or a claim on the part of the 
political left or right; it
is at any rate an ideological stance, 
not an analytic or literary
position.
The pamphlets provide the phantasmatic 
substratum on
which, in another connection and 
another place, the novelistic
works were built. Thus, very 
"honestly," the person who signs
novels and pamphlets with his 
grandmother's first name,
Celine, remembers his father's name, 
the one on his birth certificate, Louis 
Destouches, in order to acknowledge the 
thoroughly existential, biographical 
paternity of the pamphlets.
Where my identity is concerned, "I" 
have no other truth to tell
save my delirium: my paroxysmal desire 
under its social guise.
Where that other who writes and is not 
my familial ego is
concerned, "I" go beyond, "I" shift, 
"I" am no longer, for the
end of the night is without subject, 
rigadoon, music, or enchantment.

phy, delirium and scription—the 
distinction surely exists, but
it is never complete; like Janus who 
avoids the trap of an impossible 
identity, the texts, novels or 
pamphlets, also display
two faces.
Celine can thus at the same time attack 
the collapse of ideals and
the reduction of the masses to the 
satisfaction of their basest needs while
extolling those who foster such a 
situation, beginning with Hitler.
For instance, he writes in Les Beaux 
Draps:
The masses have no ideals, all they 
have is needs. And what are those
needs? [. . .] It's a platform with 
nothing but material things, a swell
feed, and a gold brick. They're an 
embryonic bourgeoisie that hasn't
yet negotiated its contract.1
Or else:
The downtrodden of the earth on the one 
side, the bourgeois on the
other, they have basically only one 
idea, to become rich or to stay
rich, it's the same thing, the lining 
has the same value as the cloth,
the same currency, the same coin, no 
difference in their hearts. It's
all guts, incorporated. Everything for 
the belly. (BD, 89)
And in L'Ecole des cadavres:
Who is the true friend of the people? 
Fascism is. / Who has done the
most for the working man? the USSR or 
Hitler? / Hitler has. / All
you have to do is look, keeping all 
that red shit away from your eyes.
/ Who has done the most for the small 
businessman? Not Thorez but
Hitler!2
This does not prevent him from 
attacking Hitler violently—
though after the war, it is true:
Hitlerite clamors, that howling 
neo-Romanticism, that Wagnerian
satanism, always seems to me obscene 
and unbearable—I am for Couperin, 
Rameau—Jaquin [. . .], Ronsard . . . 
Rabelais.3
Backing Hitler there was nothing, or 
almost nothing, I mean from
the spiritual point of view, a horde of 
petty bourgeois, greedy swine
rushing in for the spoils.4
(And that, as Celine saw it, is what 
made the Nazis unfit for
Nazism.)

176 "OURS TO JEW OR DIE"
He can lash out at and inveigh against 
Freemasons, academics, and
other secular elites, and at the same 
time attack no less violently, with
Nietzchean overtones, the Catholic 
church. Thus, on the one hand:
France is Jewish and Masonic [. . .] 
It's the Hydra with a hundred and
twenty thousand heads! Siegfried can't 
get over it! (BD, 78)
The French Masonic Republic is no 
longer anything but a very disgusting 
electoral rip-off, a fantastic 
organization for gulling very naive
Frenchmen. (EC, 31)
The profligate Masonic Republic, 
so-called French, which is completely 
at the mercy of secret societies and 
Jewish banks (Rothschild,
Lazare, Baruch, etc.), is feeling the 
pangs of agony. More gangrened
than one would think possible, it is 
rotting away scandal by scandal.
All that's left are puss-laden scraps 
from which, in spite of all, the
Jew and his Freemason dog tear away a 
few new goodies each day,
cadaverous snatches; they stuff 
themselves, what a blow-out! thrive
on them, gloat, exult, they go 
delirious on carrion. (EC, 31)
And on the other:
Having spread to the manly races, to 
the hated Aryan races, "Peter
and Paul's" religion performed 
admirably; as early as the cradle it
reduced to beggars, to a lower form of 
man, the subjected people,
the hordes intoxicated by Christianic 
literature; it hurled them, bewildered 
and besotted, to the conquest of 
Christ's Sindon, the magic
hosts, forever forsaking their Gods, 
their exalting religions, the Gods
of their blood, the Gods of their race.

He can shoot down in flames communism 
and the "Middling Revolution," but he 
can do the same to Charles Maurras. 
Thus, for
instance, in Mea Culpa or in other 
texts:

"OURS TO JEW OR DIE"
Communism without poets as it is 
practiced by Jews, scientists, rational 
reasoners, materialists, Marxists, 
bureaucrats, skunks, louts, at
the rate of six hundred kilos per 
sentence, is a very boring process of
prosaic tyranny, absolutely unable to 
take wings, an absolutely atrocious, 
Jewish satrapal imposture, unedible and 
inhuman, a very sickening forcing house 
for slaves, a hellish wager, a remedy 
worse than
the disease. (EC, 133)
And at the same time on the other side:
But what is Maurras getting at? I don't 
understand a thing about the
cunning, the dosulage, the 
high-sounding hare and hounderies of his
most Latin doctrine. (EC, 252)
And his style! His famous style! 
Sticky, stumbling, tendentious, fake,
Jewish . . . (EC, 189)
And against the bourgeois:
As for the Bourgeois, he doesn't give a 
damn, what he wants is to
keep his lettuce, his "Royal Dutch" 
stock, his privileges, his situation,
and the Lodge where he meets such fine 
people, the kind who have
a pipe-line to the government. In short 
he is Jewish, seeing that the
Jews have got the gold . . . (BD, 70)
In similar fashion, he flies into a 
black rage against the schools,
which are reductive of animal 
spontaneity and are based on abstract,
paternal reason, a reason that 
constrains and maims (A "hatcher
of symbols,"5 the school, in Les Beaux 
Draps, is a "devourer"
of the "mischievous liveliness" of 
children; by means of reason,
it inflicts false and fake values upon 
them, as opposed to spontaneous, 
innate, animal beauty), and he 
feverishly defends the true
family, the solid dictatorship of the 
father ("I go by another Family
code, one that is much hardier, more 
ample, a lot more generous, not a code 
for shrivelled up argumentative 
preservers.
Of course not! Not at all! A real code, 
one that would include
everything, animals, goods and people, 
children and the aged,
all of France in the same family, Jews 
excluded of course, a
single family, a single dad, dictator 
and respected" BD, 172).
One has to admit that out of such 
logical oscillations there
emerge a few striking words of truth. 
Such words present us
with harsh X-rays of given areas of 
social and political experience; they 
turn into fantasies or deliriums only 
from the mo-

I 77

178 "OURSTOJEWORDIE"
ment when reason attempts to globalize, 
unify, or totalize. Then
the crushing anarchy or nihilism of 
discourse topples over and,
as if it were the reverse of that 
negativism, an object appears—
an object of hatred and desire, of 
threat and aggressivity, of
envy and abomination.
That object, the Jew, gives thought a 
focus where all contradictions are 
explained and satisfied. The function 
of the Jew
in the economy of Celinian discourse 
will perhaps be better
understood after I have called 
attention to at least two common
features that structure the 
fluctuations of the pamphlets.
AGAINST THE SYMBOLIC LAW: A SUBSTITUTE 
LAW
The first is rage against the Symbolic, 
which is represented here
by religious, para-religious, and moral 
establishments (Church,
Freemasonry, School, intellectual 
Elite, communist Ideology,
etc.); it culminates in what Celine 
hallucinates and knows to
be their foundation and forebear—Jewish 
monotheism. When
one follows his associations of ideas, 
his anti-Semitism—virulent and 
stereotyped but impassioned—appears as 
the simple
outcome of a fully secular rage; 
anti-Semitism would be a diehard 
secularism sweeping away, along with 
its number one
enemy, religion, all its secondary 
representatives: abstraction,
reason, and adulterated power, 
considered emasculating.
The second is the attempt to substitute 
another Law for the
constraining and frustrating symbolic 
one, a law that would be
absolute, full, and reassuring. The 
wishes of Celine, as Fascist
ideologue, call for that law, seen as 
mystic positivity:
There is an idea that can lead nations. 
There is a law. It stems from
an idea that rises toward absolute 
mysticism, that rises still without
fear or program. If it flows in the 
direction of politics, that is the end
of it. It falls lower than mud and we 
with it [. . .] we need an idea,
a harsh doctrine, a diamond-like 
doctrine, one even more awesome
than the others, we need it for France.6
Beyond politics, and yet taking it into 
account, material positiuity, a full, 
tangible, reassuring, and happy 
substance, will be
embodied in the Family, the Nation, the 
Race, and the Body.
The novelist Celine has only too deeply 
explored the abomination that such 
entities are prey to. But the 
pamphleteer wants

"OURSTOJEWORDIE" 179
them; he fantasies them as capable of 
being full, without other,
without threat, without heterogeneity; 
he wants them harmoniously to absorb 
their differences into a kind of 
sameness
that would be obtained by means of a 
subtle drifting, a scansion,
a punctuation that would relay but 
without interrupting—a
replica of primary narcissism. Without 
Master, this universe
has rhythm; without Other, it is Dance 
and Music; without
God, it has style. Against the ternary 
economy of a Transcendence, Celine 
proclaims the immanence of substance 
and meaning, of the 
natural/racial/familial and the 
spiritual, of the feminine and the 
masculine, of life and death—a 
glorification of
the Phallus that does not speak its 
name but is communicated
to the senses as Rhythm.
One should again learn to dance. France 
remained happy up to the
rigadoon. One will never dance in the 
factories, nor will one ever sing
again. If one no longer sings, one 
passes away, one no longer conceives
children, one locks oneself up in a 
movie theater just to forget that
one exists. (BD, 148)
Oh, what delightful impertinence! 
Caught in the whirlwind [. . .] For
heavens' sake! amid a thousand 
flippancies! cat-like, on their toes, by
fits and starts! they're making fun of 
us! Ta! ta! ta! . . . [. . .] where
the melody has led us ... a summons in 
F!. . . everything evaporates!
. . . two trills again! ... an 
arabesque! ... an echappee! Good Lord,
here they are! . . . F . . . E . . . D 
. . . C . . . B! . . . Saucy girls of
heaven enchant us! Since we are to be 
damned anyway, what's the
difference! (BD, 221-222)
Celine's style shows that such a dual 
enchantment between
the "not yet one" and the "not quite 
another" can be written.
He convinces us that the jouissance of 
so-called primary narcissism's 
immanence can be sublimated in a 
signifier that has;
been recast and desemanticized into 
music (see p. 188).
Furthermore, it is impossible not to 
hear the liberating truth
of such a call to rhythm and joy, 
beyond the crippling constraints of a 
society ruled by monotheistic symbolism 
and its
political and legal repercussions.
And yet, both the enchantment of the 
style and libertarian
spontaneity bear within themselves 
their own limit; at the very
moment that they seek to escape the 
oppression of the thinking,

i8o "OURSTOJEWORDIE"
ethical, or legislative Unity, they 
prove to be tied to the deadliest
of fantasies. The negated and 
frightened desire for the One as
well as for the Other produces a 
symptom of destroying hatred
directed toward both.
At that point the image of the Jew will 
concentrate negated
love become hatred for Mastery on the 
one hand, and on the
other and jointly, desire for what 
mastery cuts out: weakness,
the joying substance, sex tinged with 
femininity and death.
Anti-Semitism, for which there thus 
exists an object as phantasmatic and 
ambivalent as the Jew, is a kind of 
parareligious
formation; it is the sociological 
thrill, flush with history, that
believers and nonbelievers alike seek 
in order to experience
abjection. One may suppose, 
consequently, that anti-Semitism
will be the more violent as the social 
and/or symbolic code is
found wanting in the face of developing 
abjection. That, at any
rate, is the situation in our 
contemporary world, and it is also,
for more personal reasons, that of 
Celine. Do not all attempts,
in our own cultural sphere at least, at 
escaping from the JudeoChristian 
compound by means of a unilateral call 
to return to
what it has repressed (rhythm, drive, 
the feminine, etc.), converge on the 
same Celinian anti-Semitic fantasy? And 
this is so
because, as I have tried to explain 
earlier (see pp. 9off.) the
writings of the chosen people have 
selected a place, in the most
determined manner, on that untenable 
crest of manness seen
as symbolic fact—which constitutes 
abjection.
In this sense, Celine's pamphlets are 
the avowed delirium out
of which the work emerges to venture 
into obscure regions at
the limits of identity. If delirium is 
indeed involved, and Celine
himself suggests that it is,7 that is 
also the nature of all antiSemitism, 
the daily banality of which surrounds 
us; Nazi excesses or Celinian 
outbursts, which are cathartic upon the
whole, give us a warning while we 
thirst for sleep and
jouissance.
BROTHER ...
What fantasies can the Jew thus 
precipitate in Celine, in order
to be the exemplar of all hatred, of 
all desire, of all fear of the
Symbolic?

"OURS TO JEW OR DIE"

All powerful at first, he stands as a 
hero. Not so much as
father than as preferred son, chosen, 
availing himself of paternal
power. Freud had noted that every hero 
is a patricide. Celine
does not go so far perhaps as to think 
of that kind of heroism,
although he implicitly takes it for 
granted when he deems that,
beyond comparison, over all other sons, 
"the Jew is a man
more than anyone else" (BM, 270).8
Such a brother, superior and envied, is 
essentially active as
opposed to the "grotesque unconcern" of 
the Aryan (BM, 128).
Such a one is Yubelblat, in Bagatelles 
pour un massacre:
He's a top-notch go-getter . . . Not a 
minute of interruption . . . He
promises . . . Promises . . . flatters 
while delineating . . . rousing
ardor or hatred . . . that tarry, 
weaken, become lost. . . He goes and
badgers them again! What a hustle . . . 
Looking out for squalls! Skimming 
through! . . . Skimming through [. . .] 
pirouettes, nimble
dodges, acrobatics . . . stealthy 
conferences, international mysteries
and legerdemain, the frail Yubelblat. 
(BM, 102)
And what is more, contrary to accepted 
stereotypes, Celine
depicts him as fearless, "The Jew, he's 
afraid of nothing
..." (BD, 136) as long as he can reach 
his goal—power. "He
always has to be the pne who gives 
orders" (BD, 141).
It is by means of full anal mastery 
("the future is his, he's
got the dough," BM, 327), which 
involves having the primordial
object, that the Jew makes certain of 
being, of being everything
and everywhere, totaling the world as a 
flawless unity under his
absolute control.
The Jews, you know, they're all 
camouflaged, disguised, chameleonlike, 
they change names like they cross 
frontiers, now they pass themselves off 
for Bretons, Auvergnats, Corsicans, now 
for Turandots,
Durandards, Cassoulets . . . anything 
at all . . . that throws people
off, that sounds deceptive. (BM, 127)
He's mimetic, he's a whore, he would 
have dissolved long ago, after
assimilating to others so much, if it 
weren't for his greed, his greed
saves him, he has worn out all races, 
all men, all animals, the earth
is now done with [. . •] He's still 
hassling the universe, heaven, God,
the Stars, he wants everything, he 
wants more, he wants the Moon,
he wants our bones, he wants our guts 
.as hair-curlers to celebrate the
Sabbath, to deck the Carnival. (BD, 142)

"OURS TO JEW OR DIE"

Secretive, privy to mystery ("The Jew 
is mysterious, he has
alien ways ..." BD, 119), he holds 
elusive power. His ubiquity
is not limited to space, he is not only 
on our land and under
our skin, the very closest neighbor, 
the nearly same, the one
we do not differentiate, the dizziness 
of identity, "we don't know
what mugs they have, or could have, 
what manners they've
got" (BM, 127); it also takes in the 
totality of time, he is heir,
scion, enhanced by issue, by a kind of 
nobility that guarantees
him the opportunity to amass traditions 
as well as goods of the
family and social group:
Any little Jew, at birth, finds in his 
cradle all the possibilities of a fine
career . . . (BM, 127)
Blessed by the father and by reliable 
families, he artfully
manipulates the networks of social 
reality, and he does it even
better if he can be accepted by the 
aristocracy.
And yet, this position of power has 
nothing in common with
the cold and majestic mastery proper to 
classic domination. In
the anti-Semitic fantasy, Jewish power 
does not arouse respect
as does paternal authority. Edged with 
fear, to the contrary,
it unleashes the excitement brought on 
by sibling rivalry; the
Aryan who engages in it is then swept 
into the fire of denied
homosexual passion. Indeed, this chosen 
brother displays too
much weakness (concerning him Celine 
calls to mind the small
size and features indicative of 
crossbreeding, when he does not
refer directly to the circumcised 
foreskin: "Lenin, Warburg,
Trotsky, Rothschild, they all think 
alike in this. Not a foreskin
of difference, it's one hundred percent 
Marxism" BD, 103),'
ambivalent lack—which can just as well 
cause surplus or even
jouissance—for one to be satisfied with 
obeying him or defying
him. Is it possible to give in to a 
being whose behavior signifies
he is an emanation of the Everything 
Everywhere, if he is so
obviously weak and sensual? His 
weakness will be held against
him—he will be considered a usurper, 
but very soon one will
admit that his jouissance is what 
grates. As if he were that
unique being, so different from the 
pagan, who draws his aura
out of his weakness, that is, not out 
of a full and glorious body
but out of his subjectivation to the 
Other.

"OURSTOJEWORDIE" 183
It is indeed for an incomprehensible 
jouissance that Celine
upbraids that favored brother by means 
of a sadomasochistic ' .
language that is openly sexual, or 
homosexual: "Fifteen million
Jews will corn-hole five hundred 
million Aryans" (BM, 127).
"He just couldn't care less, he comes, 
he's old enough, he's
having fun" (BD, 31), is said about 
Roosevelt but in the context
it also applies to Jews. "The Jews, 
Afro-Asiatic hybrids, quadroons, 
half-negroes, and Near-Easterners, 
unbridled fornicators, have no reason 
to be in this country" (EC, 215); or 
this
letter signed "Jewish Salvador" and 
addressed to the "repulsive
Celine," where one reads, among other 
fantasies, "The kikes
stick it up your ass and if you want to 
be corn-holed just let
us know" (EC, 17). The anti-Semite who 
comes up against it
finds himself reduced to a feminine and 
masochistic position,
as a passive object and slave to this 
jouissance, aggressed,
sadisticized.
The fantasy of a Jewish threat, 
weighing against the Aryan
world ("we are in the midst of Jewish 
Fascism," BM, 180) in
a period when, to the contrary, 
persecutions against the Jews
are beginning, cannot be explained in 
any other way; it emanates
directly out of that vision of the Jew 
as a being of having, as
issuing from the All in which he joys, 
and especially from the
immediate sexualization of that 
jouissance.
They do you no personal wrong? . . 
.—They get my goat . . .
[. . .] they feel me out in order to 
corner me . . . they come to size
up the crap, at each turn of the page . 
. . each minute ... to see how
much more I have softened, grown weaker 
. . . (BM, 319)
Please condescend, my darling monster! 
too discreet crucifier! too
seldom as I see it! I adore you! Grant 
all my wishes! You are keeping
me on tenterhooks! You can see that I 
am weeping! overcome with
happiness at the thought that I am at 
least going to suffer still a lot
more . . .(BM, 134)
There's always a little Jew there in 
the corner, crouching, mocking,
thinking it over . . . watching the 
goy, who's seething . . . now
heartened he comes closer . . . Seeing 
the object so fully aflame . . .
runs his hand over that lovely cunt! . 
._ . (BD, 124)

184 "OURSTOJEWORDIE"
Through the crescendo of the 
phantasmatic build up, the Jew
ends up becoming a despotic tyrant to 
whom the anti-Semite
submits his anal eroticism, explicitly 
with Celine, elsewhere in
more or less underhanded fashion. 
Celine describes himself, as
he faces this imaginary aggressor, as a 
"corn-holed figure,"
"the kikes shit in your kisser" (EC, 
17); he often seems "the
good Aryan [. . .] always ready to make 
his Jew come" (BD,
125).

And yet, if jouissance is something the 
Jew is supposed to
have knowledge of, he appears anxious 
not to spend (himself)
for it. He is master of jouissance, but 
not an artisan, not an
artist. That tyrannical brother thus 
places himself under the
purview of a law that is paternal, in 
the nature of the superego,
dominating drives, the opposite of 
natural, childish, animal,
and musical spontaneity. Anxious to 
commit himself to a bit
of "direct humanity," the Jew 
"immediately becomes more and
more tyrannical" (BM, 194). A 
domineering person, he first
gains mastery over himself through cold 
reason, which deprives
him of any access to talent. The Jew is 
the prototype of the
intellectual, the superintellectual, so 
to speak (the utmost in
intellectual frigidity is reached when 
the university man happens
to be Jewish, like Ben Montaigne, the 
professor in Les Beaux
Draps); he is incapable of art but he 
has invented "technix"
(which ushers in the artificial world 
of "flies without pricks!
soft sphincters! falsies, all the 
filthy trickeries" {BM, 177)). If he
is a writer, he is like the bourgeois 
writer author of "patched
up borrowings, things seen through a 
windshield ... a bumper
or simply stolen from the depths of 
libraries . . ." (BM, 166).
Thus identified with Law, Mastery, 
Abstraction, and Home,
he will drift from the position of 
desired and envied brother
to that of impregnable father against 
whom all the quite Oedipal
attacks of Celine's scription, claiming 
Emotion and Music as
the other of Law and Language, will 
unceasingly be directed.
At this far point of "delirium" the 
anti-Semite unveils his
denied but fierce belief in the 
Absolute of Jewish Religion as
religion of the Father and of the Law; 
the anti-Semite is its
possessed servant, its demon, its 
"dibbuk" as someone has said,9
who provides a contrario proof of 
monotheistic power of which

"OURS TO JEW OR DIE"

185

he becomes the symptom, the failure, 
the envier. Is that why
he expresses the traumatic topoi of 
that religion—like those of
abjection—which religion, to the 
contrary, elaborates, sublimates, or 
masters? All of which, without being 
its truth, at
least constitutes for the subject its 
unconscious impact?
... OR WIFE
A third step needs to be taken now as I 
construct anti-Semitic
discourse, which is frightened desire 
for the inheriting brother.
If he joys in being under the Law of 
the Other, if he submits
to the Other and draws out of it his 
mastery as well as his
jouissance, is not this dreaded Jew an 
object of the Father, a
piece of waste, his wife as it were, an 
abjection? It is on account
of being such an unbearable conjoining 
of the One and the
Other, of Law and Jouissance, of the 
one who Is and the one
who Has that the Jew becomes 
threatening. So, in order to be
protected, anti-Semitic fantasy 
relegates that object to the place
of the ab-ject. The Jew: a conjunction 
of waste and object of
desire, of corpse and life, fecality 
and pleasure, murderous aggressivity 
and the most neutralizing power—"What 
trow I? I
trow that it is 'ours to Jew or die!'" 
(BD, 57), instinctively then,
and uncompromisingly! The Jew becomes 
the feminine exalted
to the point of mastery, the impaired 
master, the ambivalent,
the border where exact limits between 
same and other, subject
and object, and even beyond these, 
between inside and outside,
and disappearing—hence an Object of 
fear and fascination.
Abjection itself. He is abject: dirty, 
rotten. And I who identify
with him, who desire to share with him 
a brotherly, mortal
embrace in which I lose my own limits, 
I find myself reduced
to the same abjection, a fecalized, 
feminized, passivated rot:
"the repulsive Celine."
[. . .] dirty bastard, loafer [. . .] 
Flushed out by Moses he holds his
rank of big shit de luxe, pally with 
none but the other flushed-outs,
within the realm of Moses, of the 
Eternal! He is nothing but decay,
decaying. He has but one authentic 
thing deep in his shitty substance,
and that's his hatred for us, his 
scorn, the fury with which he wants
to have us crumble, deeper and deeper, 
into potter's field. (BD, 113)

186 "OURS TO JEW OR DIE"
The Aryan, lacking the symbolic power 
of the Jew, is no
more than "experimental flesh," a 
"flesh in the state of decay"
(BM, 316). The French Republic is 
"gangrened," the Jews can
tear from it only "purulent scraps," 
"goodies," and "cadaverous fragments" 
(EC, 30). We are now far removed from
Louis XIV or Louis XV, to whom Celine 
compared himself,
in an interview after the war, when he 
tried to account for,
even to criticize, his anti-Semitism 
("But to the extent that they
[theJews] constituted a sect, like the 
Templars, or the Jansenists,
I was as categorical as Louis XIV [. . 
.] and Louis XV when
he got rid of the Jesuits . . . So, 
there you have it: I mistook
myself for Louis XV or Louis XIV, that 
was obviously a serious
error").10. Unless such a megalomania, 
like Majesty itself, is
the final mask behind which is 
concealed the empty, dilapidated
castle of a foul, putrid, crisis-ridden 
identity.
The anti-Semite is not mistaken. Jewish 
monotheism is not
only the most rigorous application of 
Unicity of the Law and
the Symbolic; it is also the one that 
wears with the greatest
assurance, but like a lining, the mark 
of maternal, feminine, or
pagan substance. If it removes itself 
with matchless vigor from
its fierce presence, it also integrates 
it without complacency.
And it is probably such a presence, 
other but still integrated,
that endows the monotheistic subject 
with the strength of an
other-directed being. In short, when a 
scription on the limits of
identity comes face to face with 
abjection, it enters into competition
with biblical abominations and even 
more so with prophetic discourse.
Celine alludes to biblical texts, 
mentions the prophets, vituperates 
against them. Nevertheless, his text 
follows their trajectory, jealously and 
yet differently. For he lacks the Law 
that
belongs to prophetic stance; the 
abjection that he stages, contrary to 
that of the prophets, will not be 
relieved, not through
any Name; it will merely be inscribed 
in enchantment, not for
some other time, but here and now, in 
the text. If Celine, too,
like the wandering people, undertakes a 
journey—the abjection
inherent in the speaking being having 
been duly noted—what
is involved for the novelist is a 
journey without project, without
faith, to the end of the night. And yet 
is it not obvious that for
Celine Scription and Style fully occupy 
the place left vacant by

' 'OURS TO JEW OR DIE " 187
the disappearance of God, Prophet, and 
Faith? It remains for
us to examine how such a scription, as 
Celine understands and
practices it, rather than replacing 
displaces and therefore modifies 
transcendence and also reshapes the 
subjectivity that stirs
within.

10

IN THE BEGINNING AND
WITHOUT END . . .
You know, in the Scriptures it says, 
"In the beginning was the word."
No! In the beginning was emotion. The 
Word came later, replacing
emotion like trot replaced gallop, 
while the natural law of the horse
is gallop; it is forced to break into 
trot. Man was removed from
emotional poetry and pushed into 
dialectics, in other words, 
splattering, isn't that so?
"Louis-Ferdinand Celine vous parle"

FROM CONTENT TO SOUND
If we let Celine's text ring, if we 
read his professions of faith
as a writer, we discover, toward the 
end of that night of narratives and 
historical contentions, Celine the 
stylist.
I am not a man of ideas. I am a man of 
style. Style, well, everyone
stops before that, no one really 
reaches the thing. Because it's very
hard work. It involves taking 
sentences, as I was saying, and having
them fly off their handle . . -1
Toward the end or in the beginning? 
Undoubtedly a metaphysical question, it 
is one that worries Celine and 
precisely in
relation to his confrontation with 
language.
For his "work" is a struggle, if not 
full of hatred at least
fascinated and loving, with the mother 
tongue. With and
against, further, through, beneath, or 
beyond? Celine seeks to
loosen the language from itself, to 
divide it and shift it from
itself "but ever so slightly! ever so 
slightly! because in all that,
if you.are heavy-handed, you know, it's 
putting your foot in
it, it's a howler. "2 Such loving 
auscultation is imagined essen-

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END ...

tially as probing a hidden inside, a 
buried authenticity. For
Celine, that is where the unnamable 
truth of emotion lies; there,
too, is the void that he sometimes 
points to, in a less natural
or substantial fashion, and where the 
rhythm of a music or the
gestures of a dance are being woven. 
Let us first listen to him
worshiping the French language at the 
very moment when he
tries to have it "fly off its handle":
Oh, how happy we shall be there 
together! thousands and thousands
of us over there! together and speaking 
French! Joy! Joy! Joy! how we
shall embrace! my own depravity, I 
confess my only one: the French
way of speaking! If my executioner were 
to speak French to me, I
should forgive him almost everything . 
. . how I hate foreign languages! hard 
to believe that such gobbledygook 
exists! What humbug!
(F, 95)
The French language is regal! What 
crappy gobbledygook surrounds
it! (F, 154)
I loathe English [. . .] In spite of 
everything France is doing to me I
cannot break away from the French 
language. It's got me. I can't free
myself of it.3
Such loving dedication leads the one 
who writes to an incursion the outcome 
of which he does not visualize as 
addition
or creation but quite simply as 
revelation; the point is to bring
the depths to the surface, carry 
emotional identity as far as
signifying appearances, raise neural 
and biological experience
up to social contract and communication.
To tell the truth I do not create 
anything—I clean up a sort of hidden
medal, a statue buried in loam—[. . .] 
Everything is already written
outside of man in the sky.4
The following definition of style 
should also be read as worship of the 
depths, as resurrection of the 
emotional, maternal
abyss, brought up flush with language: 
"In my emotional subway! I don't leave 
anything on the surface."5 Or in more 
naturalistic fashion:
Not simply to his ear! . . . no! . . . 
in the intimacy of his fibers! right
in his nervous system! in his own 
mind.-6

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END . . .

Carried to the extreme, this takes on 
aspects of reverse racism:
politics, speeches, bullshit! . . . 
only one truth! biology! ... in half
a century, maybe sooner, France will be 
yellow, black around the
edges . . . (R, 107)
The dizziness Celine gives way to and 
binds himself to in
order to tap emotion from the inside 
is, as he sees it, the fundamental 
truth of scription. Such dizziness 
leads him to the
fulfillment of a kind of challenge to 
abjection; it is only thus
that he can, by naming it, both have it 
exist and go beyond it.
"Vulgarity" and "sexuality" are merely 
stepping stones on the
way to the ultimate unveiling of the 
signifier; at the limit, such
themes scarcely matter:
Neither vulgarity nor sexuality have 
anything to do in this business—
They are nothing but stage properties.7
His project is to
resensitize language, to have it throb 
more than reason—SUCH WAS
MY AIM . . .8
Even though that search for the 
emotional depths is described
in terms of a substantial plunge into 
the "very intimacy of
things," Celine is the first to realize 
that melody alone reveals,
and even holds, such buried intimacy. 
The worship of emotion
thus slips into glorification of sound:
That doesn't happen without imparting 
to thought a certain melodious, melodic 
twist, a subway track [. . .] a minor 
harmonic feat.9
I know the music from deep inside of 
things—I could if need be have
alligators dance to the tune of Pan's 
pipe.10
... so that once written [. . .] IT 
SEEMS to the reader that someone
is speaking to his ear.11
At the precise point where emotion 
turns into sound, on that
articulation between body and language, 
on the catastrophefold between the two, 
there looms up "my great rival, music":
I am the organs of the Universe . . . [ 
. . . ] I'm working up the opera
of the deluge [. . .] The gate of hell 
in your ear is a little atom of
nothing. (D, 40)

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END . . .

In the final analysis, however, that 
slippage of emotion toward music and 
dance actually opens out on the void. 
Ultimately, at the end of the journey, 
there stands revealed the
complete trajectory of the mutation of 
language into style under
the impulse of an unnameable otherness, 
which, passional to
begin with, then acquires rhythm before 
becoming empty:
I am comfortable only in the presence 
of the nothing-at-all, the void.12
WRITING HATRED
Before reaching such a hollowing out, 
and perhaps precisely
on purpose of getting there, emotion, 
in order to make itself
heard, adopts colloquial speech or, 
when it acknowledges its
hatred straightforwardly, slang.
Slang is a language of hatred that 
knocks the reader out very nicely
. . . annihilates him! . . . completely 
in your power! . . . he just lies
there like an eightball!13
The vocabulary of slang, because of its 
strangeness, its very
violence, and especially because the 
reader does not always understand it, 
is of course a radical instrument of 
separation, of
rejection, and, at the limit, of 
hatred. Slang produces a semantic
fuzziness, if not interruption, within 
the utterances that it punctuates and 
rhythmicizes, but above all it draws 
near to that
emptiness of meaning at which Celine 
seems to aim.
The "spoken" outcome of emotion is more 
diversified; it is
both semantically and melodically more 
musical. I must emphasize that the 
colloquialism of Celine's prose does 
not only
express an ideological position, it is 
also a stylistic strategy. It
allows the signifier itself to hold the 
overflow of emotion that
Celine wishes to exhibit on the plane 
of language. Thus, when
he rebels against "ideas," it is in 
order to allow the appearance
"of spoken language's emotion through 
writing";14 "emotion
can be tapped and transcribed only 
through spoken language";15
"emotion is encountered in spoken 
language alone."16 Even if
"in fact there are few flashes in 
spoken language." "I attempt
to tap them ...[...] lam cornering the 
market of the living
diamonds of spoken language."17

I9'2

.

.

Celine's plan to smuggle spoken 
language into writing thus
becomes the meeting place of a 
thematic, ideological commitment with 
an enunciation that attempts to 
downgrade the logical or grammatical 
dominant of written language. The strong
counterattack (producing what 
semioticians would call a "secondary 
modeling system") of what is, for him, 
an emotion and
is marked in language by the abundance 
of prosodic and rhetorical operations, 
accomplishes that downgrading, that 
reversal.
Such an enunciation strategy obviously 
entails deep transformations in syntax. 
In Celinian language they are 
characterized by two basic devices: 
sentence segmentation (with preposing
or postponing), which is typical of the 
early novels; and syntactic
ellipsis, more or less recoverable, 
which appears in the later
novels. Thus Celine's music is composed 
through the work of
a syntactician; Celine the musician 
turns out to be a specialist
in spoken language, a grammarian who 
reconciles melody and
logic admirably well.
SEGMENTATION: INTONATION, SYNTAX,
SUBJECTIVITY
The particular, colloquial segmentation 
of the Celinian sentence
has been noticed and commented upon by 
Leo Spitzer.18 What
is involved is cutting up the syntactic 
unit and displacing one
of its constituents, postponing and 
preposing it. As a consequence, the 
normally descending modulation of the 
sentence
melody is transformed into an 
intonation having two centers.
There are countless examples of this in 
the early novels of
Celine, particularly in the Journey.
I had suddenly discovered, all at once, 
what the war was, the whole
war. I'd lost my innocence. You need to 
be pretty well alone with
it, face to face, as 1 was then, to see 
it properly, in the round, the filthy
thing. (J, 10)
Grief had come to her, in fact, when 
her words came to an end; she
did not seem to know what to do with 
it, with that grief of hers; she
tried to wipe it away with her 
handkerchief, but it came back into her
throat, her grief did, and tears came 
too, and she began all over again.
<J> 275).

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END .

.

The item displaced from the statement 
is, in the first instance,
postposed ("the filthy thing'), while 
in the second quotation it is
first preposed ("grief). The displaced 
element is represented in
the statement by an anaphoric one ("to 
see it properly"; "what
to do with it . . . that grief"; "it 
came back . . . her grief").
In such cases of reentries, the 
displaced item does not have a
precise syntactic function in the 
statement.
If one analyzed those same statements 
within another framework, not as 
syntactical structures but as messages 
in the enunciation process between a 
speaking subject and an addressee, one
would note that the purpose of the 
displacement is to thematicize
the displaced item; the latter then 
gains the status not of a theme
(in other words, that about which the 
speaker is talking) but
of an emphasized rheme (that is, 
information pertaining to the
theme). In such a contrast, the filthy 
thing and grief convey the
main information, the essential message 
the speaker stresses.
From this point of view also, the 
displaced element has been
desyntacticized.19
In short, the informative nucleus is by 
means of various displacement devices 
emphasized to the prejudice of the 
normative
syntactic structure. It is as if the 
logic of the message (theme,
rheme, support/addition, topic/comment, 
implied, stated, etc.)
modeled, in the last analysis, that of 
the syntax (subject-verbpredicate). 
Indeed, the end figuration of the rheme 
(according
to the two possible modalities, 
assertive or interrogative) indicates 
that the modality of enunciation is in 
the most fundamental manner based on 
it. The preponderance of this 
figuration, coupled with the 
theme/rheme bipartition, especially
during syntax learning by children, or 
in the emotional, relaxed
speech of everyday or colloquial 
discourse is additional evidence
of its being an organizer of 
enunciation far more deep-seated
20

than syntactic structurations.
Another Celinian phrase betrays similar 
processes. I refer to
the sentence auxiliary c'est followed 
by or not by qui or que; in
French, this provides a possibility of 
syntacticizing, by means
of an identifying predicate, a 
particular value of the message
that selects one of its-constituents in 
an emphatic manner.21
Thus, with Celine: "C'est bien irrieux 
paye et plus artiste les
chceurs que la figuration simple" 
(They're better paid and more

i 94

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END .

.

.

artistic in the chorus line than those 
who are just extras). "C'est"
identifies and emphasizes the entire 
predicate ("bien mieux paye
et plus artiste"); at the same time the 
subject constituent "les
choeurs" is, owing to the emphasis on 
the predicate, displaced
but chosen in relation to "la 
figuration simple." A strictly 
syntactic analysis could not account 
for such a turn; one would
obviously have to take into account the 
speaking subject's
emotive and logical intent, which 
imbues the usual syntactic
structure subject/predicate with a 
deeper logic. In a similar fashion, 
"C'est tres comprehensible les gens qui 
cherchent du boulot" (It's very 
understandable that people be looking 
for a job).
The sentence auxiliary "c'est" here 
introduces an inclusive predicate, 
"tres comprehensible," which refers to 
"les gens qui cherchent du boulot." In 
this case the determinative item 
precedes
the determined one, the information (or 
rheme) precedes the
object (or theme).
Such a remodeling of normative syntax 
brings the spoken
sentence (and the Celinian sentence 
closer to those languages
whose normal syntactic order is 
modifier/modified (Hungarian
and classical Chinese, for instance). 
There is a tendency in them
to give the main information first 
rather than start with the less
informative element; in other words, 
they prefer the rheme/
recall scheme over the theme/rheme 
scheme.
This turn, which Spitzer called a 
"binary turn," is accounted
for by the predominance of a logic of 
the message or of the enunciation (with 
a taking into account of the intention 
or desire of
the speaking subject within the 
communication act) over the
logic of the statement (with, in 
French, the so-called normative
syntax Subject-Verb-Object). It is 
distinguished, in addition to
its segmentations, preposings, 
displacements, or repetitions for
emphasis, by successive surges of the 
intonational curve; the latter,
instead of being smoothed out in 
"classic" descending fashion,
is slightly delayed, either raised or 
remaining at mid-intensity,
at every boundary between theme and 
rheme, support and addition. The 
resulting rhythm in Celine's 
enunciation is generally
a binary one, and in the longer 
sentences it is often staccato.
These starts are, it should be noted, 
in addition to those marked
by commas; as if, with colloquial 
segmentation, Celine pro-

cured, in addition to punctuation, new 
means of shaping his
sentences and imparting rhythm and 
music to them. "A cote
d'Alcide, /hen qu'un muffle 
impuissant/moi, epais, et vain/j'
etais ..." (Compared with Alcide, I was 
just a helpless cad,
that's what I was, dense and conceited, 
that's me). "Le printemps qu'ils/les 
oiseaux/ne reverront jamais dans leurs 
cages,
aupres des cabinets, qui sont tous 
groupes/les cabinets, la, dans
le fond de l'ombre ..." (Spring, which 
they, the birds I mean,
will never see again in their cages, 
near the toilets, which are
all close together, the toilets I mean, 
there, way back in the
shadows . . .). At every virgule (/) 
there is a slight tremolo,
less than a punctuation, more than a 
simple linking, and it gives
Celine's writings that very particular 
thrill that connotes what
is musical or intimate—in short, what 
is desirable, sexual.
Finally, what could be the 
psychological value of such a 
technique? Spitzer notes that preposing 
information testifies to too
much self-confidence or overestimating 
the addressee, while
repeating the displaced constituent 
indicates adjustment, a supplement of 
information that was needed because 
what was said
was not self-evident. From this he 
concludes, "The two contrary forces 
that are competing in this writer's 
segmented sentence are self-assurance 
and nihilistic self-observation. 
"22There
would be uneasiness, with Celine, over 
narrating what he is,
blunt, quick, and impulsive, in the 
face of the other. Consciousness of the 
other's existence would demand 
repetition for
the purpose of additional clarity and 
thus lead to segmentation.
In that type of sentence the speaking 
subject would, in short,
be in two places: that of his own 
identity (there he goes straight
to the information, the rheme), that of 
objective expression,
for the other (when he goes back, 
repeats, clarifies). Such a
psychological interpretation has the 
advantage of clarifying certain of 
Bakhtin's positions with reference to 
dialogism in a
number of novelistic writings, 
particularly those of
Dostoyevsky.23
I shall on the other hand take into 
consideration the prevalence
of that type of construction 
(theme/rheme) in children's first
sentences during syntax learning.24 For 
this binomial, which

is both intonstional and logical, 
coincides with a fundamental

196 IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END .

.

.

stage in the elaboration of the 
subject—autonomization with
respect to the other, establishment of 
his own identity. If saying
no, according to studies by Freud and 
by Rene A. Spitz, marks
man's entry into the symbolic and his 
distinguishing between
pleasure principle and reality 
principle, one might also posit
that the binarity of the message 
(rheme/theme and conversely)
represents one step further, a 
fundamental step, in the symbolic
integration of negativism, rejection, 
and death drive. One might
even call it a decisive step, for with 
message binarity and before
the establishment of syntactic 
structure, the subject not only
differentiates between pleasure and 
reality, but, quite close to
that painful and upon the whole 
impossible distinction, he asserts, "I 
state while presupposing" and "I state 
while making
clear," that is to say, "I state what 
matters to me" and "I state
in order to be clear," or again, "I 
state what pleases me" and
"I state for you, for us, so that one 
might understand one
other." The binary message thus effects 
a shift from the / of
pleasure to the you of the addressee 
and to the impersonal one
that is necessary for the establishment 
of a truly universal syntax. It is thus 
that the subject of enunciation is 
born. By calling
this trajectory back to mind he may 
rediscover, if not his origin,
at least his originality. Celine's 
"spoken" writing accomplishes
such a remembrance.
The important, integrating, and 
logico-syntactic role that
intonation plays here confirms the 
hypothesis according to
which an archaic structure would be 
involved. Indeed, recent
investigations have demonstrated that 
intonation, at the same
time as being a token of emotivity 
close to drives, is a syntactic
organizer both very precocious and very 
profound. It allows
one, before solid syntactical 
categories have been established,
and wherever there is ambiguity, to 
identify the true semanticological 
value of the constituents.25 Straddling 
two categories in
a way, the emotive and the syntactical, 
intonation produces the
language system before the latter can 
be made explicit as such.
Before being in his statement, the 
subject is manifested in the
intonational figuration of his 
enunciation, and such an anteriority is 
as logical as it is chronological.
One should not conclude, however, that 
a style where in-

^

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END ...

tonation prevails as a factor of 
logical and syntactic organization
and where the structure of the message 
(theme/rheme or conversely) overshadows 
that of the sentence 
(subject-verb-object)
corresponds to a simple regression of 
the speaker to childish
stages or to the domain of the id. When 
such strategies turn up
in adult usage, in colloquial speech, 
for instance, and above all
intentionally in Celinian style, they 
operate not on the near side
but on the far side of syntactic 
processes; we are dealing not
with a "less" but with a "more" of 
syntax. The syntactical
capacity that is already there, to 
which "regressive" strategies
are superadded, may only be a 
competence (not necessarily
explicit in the performance) of vulgar 
speakers. It is on the other
hand actualized, present, and effective 
with a writer like Celine,
for whom writing "like the common 
people" is a contrivance,
an unwritten provision, the result of 
stubborn work with and
through syntax aimed at "having 
sentences slightly fly off their
handle." "Speak straight out, 
child"—that seems to have been
the message of Celine's grandfather, a 
famous rhetorician, if
we are to believe what his grandson 
says in Guignol's Band.
"I do follow emotion with words, but I 
don't give it time to
dress up in flowery language."26 But 
this flight of the sentence
is in short an over-syntacticism. 
Enunciation devices, usually
repressed, by means of which subject 
and addressee, in their
mutual combat and fascination, discover 
logical (theme/rheme),
spatial (preposing, displacing), and 
intonational means of revealing 
themselves in the statement, show up 
here as an additional charging of 
syntactical processes. The emotion so 
dear
to Celine is not uttered in any other 
way except by a return of
repressed enunciative strategies; added 
to normative syntax,
they make up a complicated mental 
machine in which two
programs are meshed (enunciation and 
statement), just as a
piano performance results from 
conjoined playing by two
hands.
ELLIPSES: THREE DOTS AND A SUSPENSION
In the later novels, From Castle to 
Castle, North, and Rigadoon,
Celine's sentence, while maintaining 
the spoken devices of ear-

197

I98 IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END . 
. .

Her ones, is especially striking on 
account of its concision. The
famous "three dots," or points of 
suspension, as well as the
exclamation point, already present in 
previous texts, proliferate
here; they assert themselves as 
external tokens of a staccato
rhythm, of syntactical and logical 
ellipsis. Less pronounced in
Castle to Castle, the device is 
accentuated in Rigadoon, in keeping
no doubt with the apocalyptic and 
strident theme of a continent
and culture that are falling into ruins.
Let us take a closer look at Celine's 
sentence in Castle to Castle.
Very frequently the three dots come at 
the end of complete
clauses where no ellipsis is involved. 
It seems then that their
function is to signal that, while the 
syntactical structure is normally
complete, the enunciation, on the other 
hand, is not; it continues,
becomes displaced, concatenates other 
clauses. Far from being
the mark of a lacuna in the clause, the 
three dots rather point
to the overflowing of the clause into a 
higher unit of enunciation,
that of the message; this unit is 
marked out, in formal terms,
by the paragraph, and within it by the 
lack of capital letters at
the beginning of each new clause 
following the three dots. This
technique brings into being a full 
sentence, very often half a
page long, sometimes extending to a 
page or more. In opposition to the 
variability of Proustian sentences, 
Celine's avoid
subordination, do not present 
themselves as logico-syntactic
units, and proceed by means of brief 
statements; clauses that
can be uttered in one breath, cutting, 
chopping, imparting
rhythm. Here is an example:
She doesn't know, she doesn't care . . 
. she turns over . . . she's asleep
. . . I'll look all by myself! . . . 
I've got to tell you that in addition
to being a voyeur I'm a fanatic about 
the movement of harbors, about
everything that goes on on the water . 
. . everything that sails or
floats or docks ... I was on the 
jetties with my father ... a week's
vacation in Le Treport. . . Christ, the 
things we saw! . . . the fishing
boats' entrances and exits . . . 
whiting at the risk of their lives! . . 
.
the widows and the kids imploring the 
sea! ... the emotion of those
jetties!.. . .the suspense! . . . make 
the Grand Guignol and the billiondollar 
thrillers from Hollywood look like a 
kindergarten! . . . Well,
down there the Seine ... oh, I'm just 
as fascinated . . . just as nuts
about everything connected with water 
and boats, the way they move,

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END . .

. 199

their comings and goings, it's for life 
. . . there aren't many fascinations 
that last a lifetime [. . .] either 
you've got the bug ... or you
haven't ...[...] a measly little yawl 
puts into shore and down I go
. . .on the run! ... I used to run . . 
. I don't any more . . . nowadays
I'm satisfied with the spyglass . . .27
Next to complete clauses that are 
nonetheless concatenated by
the three dots, one notes two kinds of 
ellipses. On the one
hand, the points of suspension cut off 
a constituent from the
main clause or from the predicate; thus 
isolated, the constituent
loses its identity as object phrase, 
for instance, and while it does
not gain a truly autonomous value it 
still floats in a syntactic
irresolution that opens a path to 
various logical and semantic
connotations, in short, to daydreaming. 
Thus, "I'm a fanatic
about the movement of harbors, about 
everything that goes on
the water . . . everything that sails 
or floats or docks." A
comma in the place of the three dots 
would simply have linked
"I'm a fanatic" to "everything that 
sails or floats or docks."
Instead, Celine's scription gives to 
the object phrase ("everything that 
sails or floats or docks") a relative 
independence from
subject and predicate ("I'm a 
fanatic"), thus inviting the reader
to link it to another subject, another 
predicate, both indefinite
and perhaps more subjective.
The technique of making a constituent 
autonomous with
respect to the basic structure, 
subject/predicate, leads us to the
second type of ellipsis in the Celinian 
sentence: noun phrases.
For instance, "a week's vacation in Le 
Treport. . . [. . .] fishing
boats' entrances and exits . . . 
whiting at the risk of their lives!
..." Two modalities can be 
distinguished here: the suspensive
noun phrase [. . .] and the exclamatory 
noun phrase (!). In both
cases the predicate relationship has 
been omitted: "(there was,
or, we spent) a week's vacation in Le 
Treport"; "(we could see,
or, there were) the fishing boats' 
entrances and exists"; "(they
went out for) whiting at the risk of 
their lives!" One could also
interpret these statement as themes 
whose rhemes are suspended. It is as if 
the main information that these 
descriptions
contain were hushed up. What replace^ 
it, what thus plays the
part of the verb, or what assimilates 
the attitude of the subject
of enunciation is intonation. 
Suspensive intonation stresses incom-

200 IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END .

.

.

pletion and invites the addressee to 
include himself in the daydream. The 
exclamatory intonation shows the 
enthusiasm, the
surprise, the fascination of the 
speaker. As a result, the rheme
being included in and impressed upon 
the theme as intonation
does not become detached; on the other 
hand, the theme is
subjectivized. The noun phrase, "a 
week's vacation in Le
Treport," not only gives information 
concerning the length and
the place of my vacation, it also 
points to my saying it, since
it indicates—without making clear—my 
place, my emotional
and logical attitude as a subject who 
remembers, with melancholy or delight.
The coalescence of theme and rheme, 
objectal information
and strongly subjective information in 
exclamatory noun phrases
is more powerful yet: "the widows and 
the kids imploring the
sea! . . . the emotion on those 
jetties! . . . the suspense! ..."
Whether actual noun phrases or not, 
those exclamatory utterances carry, 
through their signification, a deeper 
meaning that
is not lexicalized; they reveal an 
intense, passionate attitude,
through which the speaking subject 
displays his desire and calls
upon the reader to embrace it, beyond 
words, through the
archaic configuration of melody—the 
original mark of syntax
and subjective position. "(I am 
delighted, I am telling you, see
how extraordinary it is to watch) the 
widows and the kids
imploring the sea!"
One notices here, contrary to the 
binary practice of the early
novels, a condensation of the two terms 
of the message. Theme and
rheme become superposed in a statement 
that is more and more
elliptic, a statement whose lexical 
precision is matched only by
the sparingness of the description. 
Commentary and logical or
psychological expliciting become 
unstated and are merely indicated, 
present but allusive in intonation 
alone. Avoiding signification, the 
speaker chooses not a sign (lexeme), 
even less
a sentence (syntacticological 
structure), but a token: intonation,
which bears both affect and subjective 
position (to be dressed up
semantically later or never).
Celine has compared his style to that 
of impressionist painters. It is indeed 
possible to liken to color dots 
statements in
which the binary turn of the early 
novels is condensed in short

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END . . .

units that the blank spaces of the 
three dots place side by side
to form a halo not of descriptions but 
of subjective impressions.
You know, three dots, the 
impressionists made three dots. Take 
Seurat, he would put three dots 
everywhere; he thought it let air into 
his
paintings, made it fly about. The 
fellow was right. It didn't start much
of a school [. . .] It's too hard.28
Rigadoon fully makes use of this 
device, leading to the greatest
condensation where the noun phrase—or 
simply the missing
phrase of an omitted syntactic 
structure—attains to the eruptive
value, as descriptive as it is 
subjective, of onomatopeia. Competing 
with comic strips, Celine in his 
writing used onomatopeia more and more 
frequently. According to Celine himself
the infernal rhythm of war was the 
major cause of his utterly
particular style, which thus meshes in 
its very musicality with
a kind of realism, since it 
reverberates with the war, and a
definite contemporariness, since it 
echoes comic strips.
From this moment on, I warn you, my 
chronicle is a little jerky, I
myself, who lived through what I'm 
telling you, have trouble getting
it straight ... I was talking about 
"comics" . . . even in the comics
you'd have a hard time finding a sudden 
break like that in the continuity, 
balloons, and characters . . . a 
double-barreled shambles

brutal that all of a sudden nothing

It is indeed in connection with the 
bombings that the condensed scription 
of Rigadoon finds its privileged 
expression.
The whole earth jumps! worse! like it 
was broken in two! . . . and

125-126)

The narrative goes on, nevertheless, 
through these real
"flying fragments" of the sentence; 
characters, crowd, setting,
the plan and vicissitudes of the 
journey—all are there, stated,
narrated if you wish, but barely 
suggested, in succinct fashion,
to be reconstructed in their duration 
or their logical clumsiness
by those who will have world and time. 
Here, on that page,
in that war, which is both the era and 
the style of the writer,
exclamation marks turn up to score the 
sentence and punctuate
object noun phrases with affect ("the 
flashes of their cannon!"
"howitzers!"); they do the same for 
determinatives ("red!
. . . green!"), subject noun phrases 
("and the air!"—and the air
also jumps), elliptic adverbial 
complements ("all on the station!"—we 
can see it all on the station, or they 
have all zeroed
in on the station), noun clauses ("a 
furnace!"), and complete
sentences ("The whole earth jumps!" and 
"they'll never get out
of that station, not one of them!"). 
Let me note that the binary
turn of this last colloquial sentence, 
with the stressed, elliptic
recall, "not one of them," integrates 
the dualism of the early
Celinian writings and their exclamatory 
and elliptic scription
with the shortened statements bearing 
affects without commentary of the later 
novels.
One thus reaches that extreme Celinian 
situation where the
most objectal, the most sparing 
description is blended with the
most intense affective charge, which, 
deprived of comment,
holds the unsaid but effective meaning 
of the text. In short, a
barren description of the objectal 
world, which practitioners
of the new novel that was to follow 
should have recognized as
their.antecedent. But also—and thereby 
going beyond the reifying or 
sexological technocratism of some new 
novelists—an
overflowing subjectivity that does not 
identify itself, painfully
modest, that cries out or sings, 
passionately sure of its right.

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END .

. . 203

If the early novels' binary seesawing 
is now avoided and
replaced with the terseness of noun 
phrases or clauses, exclamatorily 
suspended, a certain amount of duality 
persists nevertheless. Such a duality 
accounts for the constant tension that
makes up Celine's scription, its very 
being. It specifically involves the 
inscription of affect, on the near and 
far side of
words, in the movement of the voice as 
signaled by punctuation
signs. Children's holophrases also hold 
in abeyance, in the
motion of the hand or of the entire 
body, as well as in the
intensity or modulation of the voice, 
the judgment that, later,
will signal the position of the speaker 
with respect to the object
of enunciation. But in the later texts 
of Celine, as in the binary
turn of his early ones, what is 
involved is not simply a regression
to the holophrastic level. As they 
reappear in adult discourse,
holophrastic operations emphasize a 
strategy that comes as a
supplement to normative syntactic 
competence and performance; they 
perform as markers of a "return of the 
repressed"
at the level of the statement itself 
(and not at the thematic level
that I have discussed in previous 
chapters).
Once more, the Celinian music proves to 
be "written affect,"
thanks to a syntactico-logical 
overcompetence and to an additional 
complication of linguistic operations. 
It is now easier to
understand Celine's statements 
concerning the considerable
work that is demanded, in his view, for 
the elaboration of a
style.
Style is a certain way of doing 
violence to sentences [. . .] of having
them slightly fly off the handle, so to 
speak, displacing them, and
thus making the reader himself displace 
his meaning. But ever so
slightly! ever so slightly! Because in 
all that, if you are heavy-handed,
you know, it's putting your foot in it, 
it's a howler [. . J Often people
come to see me and say, "You seem to 
write easily." On the contrary!
I don't write easily! Only with great 
difficulty! And writing bores me,
on top of that. And it has to be done 
very shrewdly, very delicately.
That means 80,000 pages in order to 
produce 800 pages of manuscript,
where work has been obliterated. One 
doesn't see it.29
In Rigadoon the work of the writer is 
compared to the ant's
clever patience, "scurrying around in 
the filings" (R, 29).
An absorption of work, a withholding of 
effort, a deletion

204

IN THE

BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END . . .

of abstraction, so that thanks to them 
but without stating them,
and through them, an affect bursts out, 
in sound and outcry,
bordering close on drive and abjection 
as well as fascination.
Bordering on the unnamable.
THE LAUGHTER OF THE APOCALYPSE
The trans-syntactic inscription of 
emotion as inherent in the
elementary structures of enunciation is 
probably the most subtle
manifestation of what we have called 
abjection in connection
with Celinian contents, themes, and 
myths.
For exclamatory suspension reveals, as 
I have said, an intense
subjective attitude, but an 
indeterminate, ambivalent one. Being
fluid, it can easily occupy both ends 
of the drive scale, from
acceptance to rejection. Excitement and 
disgust, joy and repulsion—the reader 
deciphers them very fast on these lines
pitted with blank spaces where emotion 
does not allow itself
to be dolled up in flowery sentences. 
Descriptions of absurdity,
stupidity, violence, sorrow, moral and 
physical degeneracy locate them, as a 
result, and also informal fashion, in 
that interspace
between abjection and fascination 
signaled by Celinian
exclamations.
Such an affective ambivalence, enclosed 
in the intonation and
marked by suspension or exclamation, 
enables us to put a finger
on one of Celine's essential 
peculiarities, flush with his style—
his horrified laughter: the comedy of 
abjection. He ceaselessly
renders the sound and the image, or 
even the causes, of the
apocalypse. Never anything resembling 
treatise, commentary,
or judgment. Confronting the 
apocalypse, he exclaims with a
horror close to ecstasy. Celinian 
laughter is a horrified and
fascinated exclamation. An apocalyptic 
laughter.
We are familiar with the genesis and 
the catastrophic rhetoric
of the apocalyptic genre in the Greek 
oracles, Egyptian or Persian sources, 
but especially the Hebrew prophets. The 
great
Palestinian apocalyptic movement 
(between the second century
B-c. and the second century A.D.) 
encodes a seeingness that,
contrary to the philosophical 
revelation of truth, imposes
through a poetic incantation that is 
often elliptic, rhythmic, and

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END .

. . 205

cryptogrammic the incompleteness and 
abjection of any identity, group, or 
speech. Such a seeingness asserts 
itself as the
premise of an impossible future and as 
a promise of explosion.30
Considering only the New Testament and 
what is known
as the Revelation of Saint John the 
Divine, whom Celine mentions among his 
masters ("Everything is in Saint John," 
Feerie
pour une autre fois ["Enchantment for 
Some Other Time"], p.
54), it is around the time of the 
Christian era that the apocalyptic
genre is established; it is broadly 
inspired by Jewish prophetic
literature and other Middle-Eastern 
ones as well, immersed in
a flow of cataclysms, catastrophes, 
deaths, and ends of the
world. An identical sacred horror for 
the feminine, the diabolical, and the 
sexual are expounded therein, by means 
of an
incantation whose particular prosody 
confirms the name of the
genre: a discovering, a baring of 
truth. A vision through sounds
hallucinated as images. In no case, 
thus, is there philosophical
unveiling or reasoning demonstration of 
the hidden.
Carnival, to the contrary, does not 
keep to the rigid, that is,
moral position of apocalyptic 
inspiration; it transgresses it, sets
its repressed against it—the lower 
things, sexual matters, what
is blasphemous and to which it holds 
while mocking the law.
We are familiar with the sublime 
laughter, the astral laughter
of Dante's comedy in which the body, 
joying in a "successful"
incest, is fully celebrated in the 
delight of the word incarnate.
We are envious of the renascent mirth 
of Rabelais who gives
himself up, trustfully, to the 
pleasures of a palate where mankind 
becomes intoxicated, thinking it has 
found guiltless flesh,
mother, and body. We follow attentively 
Balzac's human comedy, knowing that its 
monstrous sufferings or absurdities are
only freakish and that they establish, 
a contrario, the truth of
divine harmony and the luminous project 
of a mind or providence in which Balzac 
says he believes.
With Celine we are elsewhere. As in 
apocalyptic or even
prophetic utterances, he speaks out on 
horror. But while the
former can be withstood because of a 
distance that allows for
judging, lamenting, condemning, 
Celine—who speaks from
within—has no threats to utter, no 
morality to defend. In the
name of what would he do it? So his 
laughter bursts out, facing

206

IN THE BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END .

. .

abjection, and always originating at 
the same source, of which
Freud had caught a glimpse: the gushing 
forth of the unconscious, the 
repressed, suppressed pleasure, be it 
sex or death.
And yet, if there is a gushing forth, 
it is neither jovial, nor
trustful, nor sublime, nor enraptured 
by preexisting harmony.
It is bare, anguished, and as 
fascinated as it is frightened.
A laughing apocalypse is an apocalypse 
without god. Black
mysticism of transcendental collapse. 
The resulting scription
is perhaps the ultimate form of a 
secular attitude without morality, 
without judgment, without hope. Neither 
Celine, who
is such a writer, nor the catastrophic 
exclamation that constitutes his style, 
can find outside support to maintain 
themselves.
Their only sustenance lies in the 
beauty of a gesture that, here,
on the page, compels language to come 
nearest to the human
enigma, to the place where it kills, 
thinks, and experiences
jouissance all at the same time. A 
language of abjection of which
the writer is both subject and victim, 
witness and topple. Toppling into what? 
Into nothing more than the 
effervescence of
passion and language we call style, 
where any ideology, thesis,
interpretation, mania, collectivity, 
threat, or hope become
drowned. A brilliant and dangerous 
beauty, fragile obverse of
a radical nihilism that can disappear 
only in "those bubbling
depths that cancel our existence" (R, 
261). Music, rhythm,
rigadoon, without end, for no reason.

POWERS OF HORROR
All the great monstrosities, all of 
them are in Saint John! Kirghiz
librarians can cook up the damnest

Celine, Feerie pour une autrefois, I

Throughout a night without images but 
buffeted by black
sounds; amidst a throng of forsaken 
bodies beset with no longJng but to 
last against all odds and for nothing; 
on a page where
I plotted out the convolutions of those 
who, in transference,
presented me with the gift of their 
void—I have spelled out
abjection. Passing through the memories 
of a thousand years,
a fiction without scientific objective 
but attentive to religious
imagination, it is within literature 
that I finally saw it carrying,
with its horror, its full power into 
effect.
On close inspection, all literature is 
probably a version of the
apocalypse that seems to me rooted, no 
matter what its sociohistorical 
conditions might be, on the fragile 
border (borderline
cases) where identities 
(subject/object, etc.) do not exist or 
only
barely so—double, fuzzy, heterogeneous, 
animal, metamorphosed, altered, abject.
The work of Celine, which draws on the 
contemporary for
its destructive, if not analytical, 
obstinacy, and on the classical
for its epic capability together with 
its plebeian, if not vulgar,
breadth, is upon the whole only one 
possible example among
others of the abject. Baudelaire, 
Lautreamont, Kafka, Georges
Bataille, Sartre (Nausea), or other 
contemporaries could have
guided, each in his own way, my descent 
into the hell of naming, that is to say 
of signifiable identity. But perhaps 
Celine is
also a privileged example and hence a 
convenient one to deal
with. For his coarseness, issuing from 
the global catastrophe

r

208

POWERS OF HORROR

of the Second World War, does not, 
within the orb of abjection,
spare a single sphere: neither that of 
morality, or politics, or
religion, or esthetics, or, all the 
more so, subjectivity or language. If 
in that process he shows us the 
ultimate point that
can be reached by what a moralist would 
call nihilism, he also
testifies to the power of fascination 
exerted upon us, openly or
secretly, by that field of horror. I 
have sought in this book to
demonstrate on what mechanism of 
subjectivity (which I believe to be 
universal) such horror, its meaning as 
well as its
power, is based. By suggesting that 
literature is its privileged
signifier, I wish to point out that, 
far from being a minor,
marginal activity in our culture, as a 
general consensus seems
to have it, this kind of literature, or 
even literature as such,
represents the ultimate coding of our 
crises, of our most intimate and most 
serious apocalypses. Hence its 
nocturnal power,
"the great darkness" (Angela of 
Foligno). Hence its continual
compromising: "Literature and Evil" 
(Georges Bataille). Hence
also its being seen as taking the place 
of the sacred, which, to
the extent that it has left us without 
leaving us alone, calls forth
the quacks from all four corners of 
perversion. Because it occupies its 
place, because it hence decks itself 
out in the sacred
power of horror, literature may also 
involve not an ultimate
resistance to but an unveiling of the 
abject: an elaboration, a
discharge, and a hollowing out of 
abjection through the Crisis
of the Word.
If "something maternal" happens to bear 
upon the uncertainty that I call 
abjection, it illuminates the literary 
scription
of the essential struggle that a writer 
(man or woman) has to
engage in with what he calls demonic 
only to call attention to
it as the inseparable obverse of his 
very being, of the other (sex)
that torments and possesses him. Does 
one write under any
other condition than being possessed by 
abjection, in an in£.
definite catharsis? Leaving aside 
adherents of a feminism that
is jealous of conserving its power—the 
last of the power-seeking 
ideologies—none will accuse of being a 
usurper the artist
who, even if he does not know it, is an 
undoer of narcissism
and of all imaginary identity as well, 
sexual included.
And yet, in these times of dreary 
crisis, what is the point of
emphasizing the horror of being?

POWERS OF HORROR 209

Perhaps those that the path of 
analysis, or scription, or of a
painful or ecstatic ordeal has led to 
tear the veil of the communitarian 
mystery, on which love of self and 
others is set up,
only to catch a glimpse of the abyss of 
abjection with which
they are underlaid—they perhaps might 
be able to read this
book as something other than an 
intellectual exercise. For abjection, 
when all is said and done, is the other 
facet of religious,
moral, and ideological codes on which 
rest the sleep of individuals and the 
breathing spells of societies. Such 
codes are
abjection's purification and 
repression. But the return of their
repressed make up our "apocalypse," and 
that is why we cannot
escape the dramatic convulsions of 
religious crises.
In the end, our only difference is our 
unwillingness to have
a face-to-face confrontation with the 
abject. Who would want
to be a prophet? For we have lost faith 
in One Master Signifier.
We prefer to foresee or seduce; to plan 
ahead, promise a recovery, or 
esthetize; to provide social security 
or make art not
too far removed from the level of the 
media.
In short, who, I ask you, would agree 
to call himself abject,
subject of or subject to abjection?
Nothing preordains the psychoanalyst to 
take the place of
the mystic. Psychoanalytic 
establishments seem even less suited
to this, so much does their intrinsic 
perversion consign them
to mummifying transference in the 
production of mini-paranoids if not 
merely stereotyped besotments. And yet, 
it would
perhaps be possible for an analyst (if 
he could manage to stay
in the only place that is his, the 
void, that is, the unthinkable
of metaphysics) to begin hearing, 
actually to listen to himself
build up a discourse around the braided 
horror and fascination
that bespeaks the incompleteness of the 
speaking being but,
because it is heard as a narcissistic 
crisis on the outskirts of the
feminine, shows up with a comic gleam 
the religious and political pretensions 
that attempt to give meaning to the 
human
adventure. For, facing abjection, 
meaning has only a scored,
rejected, ab-jected meaning—a comical 
one. "Divine," "human,"
or "for some other time," the comedy or 
the enchantment can
be realized, on the whole, only by 
reckoning with the impossible for later 
or never, but set and maintained right 
here.
Fastened to meaning like Raymond 
Roussel's parrot to its

210

POWERS OF HORROR

chain, the analyst, since he 
interprets, is probably among the
rare contemporary witnesses to our 
dancing on a volcano. If
he draws perverse jouissance from it, 
fine; provided that, in his
or her capacity as a man or woman 
without qualities, he allow
the most deeply buried logic of our 
anguish and hatred to burst
out. Would he then be capable of 
X-raying horror without
making capital out of its power? Of 
displaying the abject without confusing 
himself for it?
Probably not. Because of knowing it, 
however, with a
knowledge undermined by forgetfulness 
and laughter, an abject
knowledge, he is, she is preparing to 
go through the first great
demystification of Power (religious, 
moral, political, and verbal) that 
mankind has ever witnessed; and it is 
necessarily taking
place within that fulfillment of 
religion as sacred horror, which
is Judeo-Christian monotheism. In the 
meantime, let others
continue their long march toward idols 
and truths of all kinds,
buttressed with the necessarily 
righteous faith for wars to come,
wars that will necessarily be holy.
Is it the quiet shore of contemplation 
that I set aside for
myself, as I lay bare, under the 
cunning, orderly surface of
civilizations, the nurturing horror 
that they attend to pushing
aside by purifying, systematizing, and 
thinking; thehorror that
they seize on in order to build 
themselves up and function? I
rather conceive it as a work of 
disappointment, of frustration,
and hollowing—probably the only 
counterweight to abjection.
While everything else—its archeology 
and its exhaustion—is
only literature: the sublime point at 
which the abject collapses
in a burst of beauty that overwhelms 
us—and "that cancels our
existence" (Celine).

1953-1974), 10:83. Later, when he 
referred to "the enigmatic phobias of 
early
childhood," Freud explicitly defined 
them as "reactions to the danger of
object loss." He suggests that the 
reactions are (phantasmatically?) very 
archaic
when he considers the possible 
connections between childish phobia of 
small
animals or storms, for instance, and 
"the atrophied remainders of congenital
preparation for real dangers that are 
so clearly developed in other animals."
He nevertheless concludes that, "in the 
case of man, the only portion of that
archaic inheritance to be appropriated 
is what pertains to object loss" 
(Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety, in 
Complete Psychological Works, 20:160). 
That
clearly locates the reflection on 
phobia within the problematic scope of 
object
relation. What remains to be clarified 
is the latter's dependency on symbolic
function, particularly on language, on 
which rest not only its very existence
but all of its variants.

sharp cleavage into an ego and an id, 
and
before the formation of a super-ego, 
the mental apparatus makes use of
different methods of defense from those 
which it employs after it has reached
these stages of organization." Freud, 
Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety, p.
164. To begin with, Freud had pointed 
out that the word "defense," in
opposition to the more precise term 
"repression," included all the 
protective
devices of the ego against the demands 
of drives; with the statement I have
just quoted, Freud seems to proceed to 
areas where, without the ego existing
as such, modalities of defense other 
than repression are at work. Does this
have to do with defensive capabilities 
that are elaborated along with primal
repression? With the power of the 
symbolic alone, always already present 
but
working within its pre-sign, 
pre-meaning (trans-sign, trans-meaning) 
modality, which I call "semiotic"? 
Would not the phobic "object," and the 
abject as well, be located on that 
trail, which was blazed by Freud?

violence done to the object. 
Consequently it will be understood that 
the problem involving relationship 
between
Ego and object is that of their limits, 
their coexistence. [. . .] When I speak
of trauma-object 1 basically refer to 
the threat that the object holds for the
Ego, to the extent that it forces the 
Ego to modify its operation through its
presence alone." Andre Green,

3. Such osmosis of separate terms, such 
heterogeneity, appears to have
been glimpsed by Hegel when he 
considered "sin" as inseparable from 
"remission of sins" and concluded, 
"Between sin and its forgiveness there 
is as
little place for an alien thing as 
there is between sin and punishment. 
Life has
severed itself from itself and united 
itself again." The Spirit of

6. From an interview with Ivan-M. 
Sicard published in L'Emancipation
Nationale, November 21, I9417- It would 
not only seem that, to the end of his 
life, he never clearly
renounced anti-Semitism ("I disown 
nothing at all ... I have not at all
changed my mind ... I simply put in a 
modicum of doubt, but people will
have to prove that I was wrong rather 
than me showing that I was right"—
"Entretien avec A. Zbinden," Romans II, 
p. 940), but even when he entertains
the idea of a reconciliation with Jews 
(he specifies, "not a Defense of the 
Jews

)

but a Reconciliation") he is led to 
advocate a new racism, a decidedly 
permanent
feeling of love/hatred for the other: 
"We must create a new racism upon
biological bases" (letter to Hindus, 
August io, 1947, L'Herne, 5:90).
