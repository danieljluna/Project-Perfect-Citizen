You told me to be candid with you Chandler,
so I will. While I've never acted on my
impulses in person, I'm feeling guilty for
something.

I found some pictures online.

Am I wrong for looking at them? For keeping
them?

Delete those pictures immediately. There is a
line we don't cross and you're crossing it.

Help me understand why.  Isn't looking at
photos a victimless crime?

No Murphy.

Someone hurt those children, and what you're
viewing is the product of that violence.

By having it on your computer, you're
participating, even contributing to it.
You're complicit in a black market predicated
on violating children.

Remove the pictures, or remove yourself from
Virtue Community. Am I being clear?

Alright, I get it. I'll delete them.

Sorry.
