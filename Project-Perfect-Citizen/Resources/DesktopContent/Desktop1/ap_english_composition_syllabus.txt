Course Description:
Students enrolled in AP English 
Composition should expect a significant 
challenge compared to past courses. The 
work
demanded of students is at a college 
level; the texts navigate complex 
concepts, and work is presented at a 
rapid rate.
The themes dealt with are adult in 
nature, and will ask you to meet them 
with an open mind.
Alongside reading and interpreting 
great works of literature, students 
will develop organization and writing 
skills.
Expect large amounts of both in-class 
work and homework.

Course Competencies/ Learning Objectives
AP English Comp will require students 
to be competent in the following areas:
 - In-depth textual analysis of all 
course readings
 - Formation of strong argument using 
course themes and concepts
 - Draw heavily from text as basis for 
thesis
 - Participation in class discussions 
and dialogues on course materials
 - Discussions on the material are to be 
respectful in the interest of keeping a 
safe learning space for all
 - Drafts will be graded based on in 
class peer evaluations
 - Schedule yourself and be on top of 
deadlines - essay resubmissions past 
due dates are not accepted

Student Evaluation
Grading for this course is constituted 
by the following:
Major Papers - 40%
Quizzes, Classwork, & Assignments - 30%
Attendance & Class Participation - 20%
Homework - 10%

The above areas will be used as the 
basis for 80% of your grade per 
semester. The midterm and/or final exam 
will
constitute the remaining 20% of your 
grade per semester.

Attendance Policy
Attendance for this course is 
mandatory, as class participation and 
discussion are core to understanding the
material. If you miss more than 2 
classes, your participation grade will 
drop. Missing 5 or more may result in a 
failing grade.
All students are expected to attend 
every scheduled class on time. 
Exceptions may be made for illness and 
valid emergencies.
Classroom Expectations
1. Students will come to class on time 
prepared and ready to learn.
2. Students will complete all 
assignments, including homework, by all 
deadlines. Make-up work is only 
accepted after an
excused absence. It is your 
responsibility to see me for your work 
before or after school.
3. All students will be silent and 
respectful while other students read 
aloud.
4. The teachers and students will work 
together for a respectful, safe 
classroom.
5. Participation in class discussions 
will enhance all students' learning 
experiences.
6. Students are expected to have all 
assigned readings completed; this may 
require some reading to be completed 
outside
of the classroom.
7. Cell phones, iPods, mp3 players, and 
any other personal items will be 
confiscated if used during class.

Class Requirements
Students will be required to complete 
and pass writing assignments. Students 
will also be required to read outside 
of class,
participate meaningfully and 
respectfully in classroom discussions, 
maintain good attendance, have a 
respectful and
positive attitude, and come to class 
ready to learn!

Rewrite Policy
Any written assignment that receives a 
less than desirable grade may be 
revised and rescored, so long as it was 
initially
submitted on time, a student-teacher 
conference has taken place, and the 
rewritten assignment is resubmitted in 
a timely
fashion (no more than 3 days after the 
assignment was returned to the student).

Plagiarism, Cheating, and Academic 
Integrity
Plagiarism is defined by the use of 
others words, images, or content of any 
form without adequate citation. 
Cheating is the
giving or receiving of help on anything 
that has been determined by the teacher 
to be an individual effort. Both are
violations of the Student Code of 
Conduct and will result in a failing 
grade.
