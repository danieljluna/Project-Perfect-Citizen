PART 1. THE TALE

1. The Cat's Eye

I grew up very much alone, and as far 
back as I recall I was frightened of 
anything sexual. I was
nearly sixteen when I met Simone, a 
girl my own age, at the beach in X. Our 
families being
distantly related, we quickly grew 
intimate. Three days after our first 
meeting, Simone and I were
alone in her villa. She was wearing a 
black pinafore with a starched white 
collar. I began to
realize that she shared my anxiety at 
seeing her, and I felt even more 
anxious that day because I
hoped she would be stark naked under 
the pinafore.

She had black silk stockings on 
covering her knees, but I was unable to 
see as far up as the cunt
(this name, which I always used with 
Simone, is, I think, by far the 
loveliest of the names for the
vagina). It merely struck me that by 
slightly lifting the pinafore from 
behind, I might see her private
parts unveiled.

Now in the corner of a hallway there 
was a saucer of milk for the cat. "Milk 
is for the pussy, isn't
it?" said Simone. "Do you dare me to 
sit in the saucer?"

"I dare you," I answered, almost 
breathless.

The day was extremely hot. Simone put 
the saucer on a small bench, planted 
herself before me,
and, with her eyes fixed on me, she sat 
down without my being able to see her 
burning buttocks
under the skirt, dipping into the cool 
milk. The blood shot to my head, and I 
stood before her
awhile, immobile and trembling, as she 
eyed my stiff cock bulging in my 
trousers. Then I lay down
at her feet without her stirring and 
for the first time, I saw her pink and 
dark flesh cooling in the
white milk. We remained motionless, 
both of us equally overwhelmed...

Suddenly, she got up, and I saw the 
milk dripping down her thighs to the 
stockings. She wiped
herself evenly with a handkerchief as 
she stood over my head with one foot on 
the small bench,
and I vigorously rubbed my cock through 
the trousers while writhing amorously 
on the floor. We
reached orgasm at almost the same 
instant without even touching one 
another. But when her
mother came home, I was sitting in a 
low armchair, and I took advantage oft 
he moment when the
girl tenderly snuggled in her mother's 
arms: I lifted the back of her 
pinafore, unseen, and thrust
my hand under her cunt between her two 
burning legs.

I dashed home, eager to masturbate 
again. The next day there were such 
dark rings around my
eyes that Simone, after peering at me 
for a while, buried her head in my 
shoulder and said
earnestly: "I don't want you to toss 
off any more without me."

Thus a love life started between the 
girl and myself, and it was so intimate 
and so intense that we
could hardly let a week go by without 
meeting. And yet we virtually never 
talked about it. I
realized that her feelings at seeing me 
were the same as mine at seeing her, 
but I found it difficult
to have things out. I remember that one 
day, when we were in a car tooling 
along at top speed,
we crashed into a cyclist, an 
apparently very young and very pretty 
girl. Her head was almost
totally ripped off by the wheels. For a 
long time, we were parked a few yards 
beyond without
getting out, fully absorbed in the 
sight of the corpse. The horror and 
despair at so much bloody
flesh, nauseating in part, and in part 
very beautiful, was fairly equivalent 
to our usual impression
upon seeing one another. Simone was 
tall and lovely. She was usually very 
natural; there was
nothing heartbreaking in her eyes or 
her voice. But on a sensual level, she 
so bluntly craved any
upheaval that the faintest call from 
the senses gave her a look directly 
suggestive of all things
linked to deep sexuality, such as 
blood, suffocation, sudden terror, 
crime; things indefinitely
destroying human bliss and honesty. I 
first saw her mute and absolute spasm 
(which I shared)
the day she sat down in the saucer of 
milk. True, we only exchanged fixed 
stares at analogous
moments. But we never calmed down or 
played except in the brief, relaxed 
minutes after an
orgasm.

I ought to say, nevertheless, that we 
waited a long time before copulating. 
We merely took any
opportunity to indulge in unusual acts. 
We did not lack modesty-on the 
contrary-but something
urgently drove us to defy modesty 
together as immodestly as possible. 
Thus, no sooner had she
asked me never to toss off again by 
myself than we had met on top of a 
cliff, then she pulled
down my pants and had me stretch out on 
the ground. She tucked her dress up, 
mounted my
belly with her back towards my face, 
and let herself go, while I thrust my 
finger, lubricated with my
young sperm, into her cunt. Next, she 
lay down, with her head under my cock 
between my legs,
and thrusting her cunt in the air, she 
brought her body down towards me, while 
I raised my head
to the level of that cunt: her knees 
found support on my shoulders.

"Can't you pee up to my cunt?" she said.

"Yes," I answered, "but with you like 
this, it'll get on your dress and your 
face."

"So what," she concluded. And I did as 
she said, but no sooner was I done than 
I flooded her
again, this time with fine white come.

Meanwhile, the smell of the sea mixed 
with the smell of wet linen, our naked 
bodies, and the
come. Evening was gathering, and we 
stayed in that extraordinary position, 
tranquil and
motionless, when all at once we heard 
steps crushing the grass.

"Please don't move, please," Simone 
begged.

The steps halted, but it was impossible 
to see who was approaching. Our 
breathing had stopped
together. Simone's ass, raised aloft, 
did strike me as an all-powerful 
entreaty, perfect as it was;
with its two narrow, delicate buttocks 
and its deep crevice; and I never 
doubted for an instant that
the unknown man or woman would soon 
give in and feel compelled to 
masturbate endlessly while
watching that behind. Now the steps 
resumed, faster this time, almost 
running, and suddenly a
ravishing blond girl loomed into view: 
Marcelle, the purest and most affecting 
of our friends. But
we were too strongly contracted in our 
dreadful positions to move even a 
hair's breadth, and it
was our unhappy friend who suddenly 
collapsed and huddled in the grass amid 
sobs. Only now
did we tear loose from our extravagant 
embrace to hurl ourselves upon a self 
abandoned body.
Simone hiked up the skirt, ripped off 
the panties, and drunkenly showed me a 
new cunt, as lovely
and pure as her own: I kissed it 
furiously while finger fucking Simone, 
whose legs closed around
the hips of that strange Marcelle, who 
no longer hid anything but her sobs.

"Marcelle," I exclaimed, "please, 
please don't cry. I want you to kiss me 
on the mouth..."

Simone, for her part, stroked the 
girl's lovely smooth hair, covering her 
body with fond kisses.

Meanwhile the sky had turned quite 
thundery, and, with nightfall, huge 
raindrops began plopping
down, bringing relief from the 
harshness of a torrid, airless day. The 
sea was loudly raging,
outroared by long rumbles of thunder, 
while flashes of lightning, bright as 
day, kept brusquely
revealing the two pleasured cunts of 
the now silent girls. A brutal frenzy 
drove our three bodies.
Two young mouths fought over my ass, my 
balls, and my cock, but I still kept 
pushing apart
female legs wet with saliva and come, 
splaying them as if writhing out of a 
monster's grip, and yet
that monster was nothing but the utter 
violence of my movements. The hot rain 
was finally
pouring down and streaming over our 
fully exposed bodies. Huge booms of 
thunder shook us,
heightening our fury, wresting forth 
our cries of rage, which each flash 
accompanied with a
glimpse of our sexual parts. Simone had 
found a mud puddle, and was smearing 
herself wildly:
she was jerking off with the earth and 
coming violently, whipped by the 
downpour, my head
locked in her soil-covered legs, her 
face wallowing in the puddle, where she 
was brutally churning
Marcelle's cunt, one arm around 
Marcelle's hips, the hand yanking the 
thigh, forcing it open.

2. The Antique Wardrobe

That was the period when Simone 
developed a mania for breaking eggs 
with her behind. She
would do a headstand on an armchair in 
the parlor, her back against the 
chair's back, her legs
bent towards me, while I jerked off in 
order to come in her face. I would put 
the egg right on the
hole in her ass, and she would 
skillfully amuse herself by shaking it 
in the deep crack of her
buttocks. The moment my come shot out 
and trickled down her eyes, her 
buttocks would squeeze
together and she would come while I 
smeared my face abundantly in her ass.

Very soon, of course, her mother, who 
might enter the villa parlor at any 
moment, did catch us in
our unusual act. But still, the first 
time this fine woman stumbled upon us, 
she was content,
despite having led an exemplary life, 
to gape wordlessly, so that we did not 
notice a thing. I
suppose she was too flabbergasted to 
speak. But when we were done and trying 
to clean up the
mess, we noticed her standing in the 
doorway.

"Pretend there's no one there," Simone 
told me, and she went on wiping her 
behind.

And indeed, we blithely strolled out as 
though the woman had been reduced to a 
family portrait.

A few days later, however, when Simone 
was doing gymnastics with me in the 
rafters of a
garage, she pissed on her mother, who 
had the misfortune to stop underneath 
without seeing her.
The sad widow got out of the way and 
gazed at us with such dismal eyes and 
such a desperate
expression that she egged us on, that 
is to say, simply, with Simone bursting 
into laughter,
crouching on all fours on the beams and 
exposing her cunt to my face, I 
uncovered that cunt
completely and masturbated while 
looking at it.

More than a week had passed without our 
seeing Marcelle, when we ran into her 
on the street
one day. The blonde girl, timid and 
naively pious, blushed so deeply at 
seeing us, that Simone
embraced her with uncommon tenderness.

"Please forgive me, Marcelle," she 
murmured. "What happened the other day 
was absurd, but
that doesn't mean we can't be friends 
now. I promise we'll never lay a hand 
on you again."

Marcelle, who had an unusual lack of 
will power, agreed to join us for tea 
with some other friends
at our place. But instead of tea, we 
drank quantities of chilled champagne.

The sight of Marcelle blushing had 
completely overwhelmed us. We 
understood one another,
Simone and I, and we were certain that 
from now on nothing would make us 
shrink from
achieving our ends. Besides Marcelle, 
there were three other pretty girls and 
two boys here. The
oldest of the eight being not quite 
seventeen, the beverage soon took 
effect; but aside from
Simone and myself, they were not as 
excited as we wanted them to be. A 
gramophone rescued
us from our predicament. Simone, 
dancing a frenzied Charleston by 
herself, showed everyone
her legs up to her cunt, and when the 
other girls were asked to dance a solo 
in the same way,
they were in too good a mood to require 
coaxing. They did have panties on, but 
the panties
bound the cunt laxly without hiding 
much. Only Marcelle, intoxicated and 
silent, refused to dance.

Finally, Simone, pretending to be dead 
drunk, crumpled a tablecloth and, 
lifting it up, she offered
to make a bet.

"I bet," she said, "that I can pee into 
the tablecloth in front of everyone."

It was basically a ridiculous party of 
mostly turbulent and boastful 
youngsters. One of the boys
challenged her, and it was agreed that 
the winner would fix the penalty... 
Naturally, Simone did
not waver for an instant, she richly 
soaked the tablecloth. But this 
stunning act visibly rattled her
to the quick, so that all the young 
fools started gasping.

"Since the winner decides the penalty," 
said Simone to the loser, "I am now 
going to pull down
your trousers in front of everyone."

Which happened without a hitch. When 
his trousers were off, his shirt was 
likewise removed (to
keep him from looking ridiculous). All 
the same, nothing serious had occurred 
as yet: Simone had
scarcely run a light hand over her 
young friend, who was dazzled, drunk, 
and naked. Yet all she
could think of was Marcelle, who for 
several moments now had been begging me 
to let her leave.

"We promised we wouldn't touch you, 
Marcelle. Why do you want to leave?"

"Just because," she replied stubbornly, 
a violent rage gradually overcoming her.

All at once, to everyone's horror, 
Simone fell upon the floor. A 
convulsion shook her harder and
harder, her clothes were in disarray, 
her bottom stuck in the air, as though 
she were having an
epileptic fit. But rolling about at the 
foot of the boy she had undressed, she 
mumbled almost
inarticulately:

"Piss on me... Piss on my cunt..." she 
repeated, with a kind of thirst.

Marcelle gaped at this spectacle: she 
blushed again, her face was blood-red. 
But then she said to
me, without even looking at me, that 
she wanted to take off her dress. I 
half tore it off, and straight
after, her underwear. All she had left 
was her stockings and belt, and after I 
fingered her cunt a bit
and kissed her on the mouth, she glided 
across the room to a large antique 
bridal wardrobe,
where she shut herself in after 
whispering a few words to Simone.

She wanted to toss off in the wardrobe 
and was pleading to be left in peace.

I ought to say that we were all very 
drunk and completely bowled over by 
what had been going
on. The naked boy was being sucked by a 
girl. Simone, standing with her dress 
tucked up, was
rubbing her bare cunt against the 
wardrobe, in which a girl was audibly 
masturbating with brutal
gasps. And all at once, something 
incredible happened, a strange swish of 
water, followed by a
trickle and a stream from under the 
wardrobe door: poor Marcelle was 
pissing in her wardrobe
while masturbating. But the explosion 
of totally drunken guffaws that ensued 
rapidly degenerated
into a debauch of tumbling bodies, 
lofty legs and asses, wet skirts and 
come. Guffaws emerged
like foolish and involuntary hiccups 
but scarcely managed to interrupt a 
brutal onslaught of cunts
and cocks. And yet soon we could hear 
Marcelle dismally sobbing alone, louder 
and louder, in the
makeshift pissoir that was now her 
prison.

Half an hour later, when I was less 
drunk, it dawned on me that I ought to 
let Marcelle out of her
wardrobe: the unhappy girl, naked now, 
was in a dreadful state. She was 
trembling and shivering
feverishly. Upon seeing me, she 
displayed a sickly but violent terror. 
After all, I was pale,
smeared with blood, my clothes askew. 
Behind me, in unspeakable disorder, 
brazenly stripped
bodies were sprawled about. During the 
orgy, splinters of glass had left deep 
bleeding cuts in two
of us. A young girl was throwing up, 
and all of us had exploded in such wild 
fits of laughter at
some point or other that we had wet our 
clothes, an armchair, or the floor. The 
resulting stench of
blood, sperm, urine, and vomit made me 
almost recoil in horror, but the 
inhuman shriek from
Marcelle's throat was far more 
terrifying. I must say, however, that 
Simone was sleeping tranquilly
by now, her belly up, her hand still on 
her pussy, her pacified face almost 
smiling.

Marcelle, staggering wildly across the 
room with shrieks and snarls, looked at 
me again. She
flinched back as though I were a 
hideous ghost in a nightmare, and she 
collapsed in a jeremiad of
howls that grew more and more inhuman.

Astonishingly, this litany brought me 
to my senses. People were running up, 
it was inevitable. But
I never for an instant dreamt of 
fleeing or lessening the scandal. On 
the contrary, I resolutely
strode to the door and flung it open. 
What a spectacle, what joy! One can 
readily picture the cries
of dismay, the desperate shrieks, the 
exaggerated threats of the parents 
entering the room!
Criminal court, prison, the guillotine 
were evoked with fiery yells and 
spasmodic curses. Our
friends themselves began howling and 
sobbing in a delirium of tearful 
screams; they sounded as
if they had been set afire as live 
torches. Simone exulted with me.

And yet, what an atrocity! It seemed as 
if nothing could terminate the 
tragicomical frenzy of these
lunatics, for Marcelle, still naked, 
kept gesticulating, and her agonizing 
shrieks of pain expressed
unbearable terror and moral suffering; 
we watched her bite her mother's face 
amid arms vainly
trying to subdue her.

Indeed, by bursting in, the parents 
managed to wipe out the last shreds of 
reason, and in the end,
the police had to be called, with all 
the neighbors witnessing the outrageous 
scandal.

3. Marcelle's Smell

My own parents had not turned up that 
evening with the pack. Nevertheless, I 
judged it prudent to
decamp and elude the wrath of an awful 
father, the epitome of a senile 
Catholic general. I entered
our villa by the back door and filched 
a certain amount of money. Next, quite 
convinced they
would look for me everywhere but there, 
I took a bath in my father's bedroom. 
Finally, by around
ten o'clock, I was out in the open 
country, having left the following note 
on my mother's bedside
table: "I beseech you not to send the 
police after me for I am carrying a 
gun, and the first bullet
will be for the policeman, the second 
for myself."

I have never had any aptitude for what 
is known as striking a pose, and in 
this circumstance in
particular, I only wished to keep my 
family at bay, for they relentlessly 
hated scandal. Still, having
written the note with the greatest 
levity and not without laughing, I 
thought it might not be such a
bad idea to pocket my father's revolver.

I walked along the seashore most of the 
night, but without getting very far 
from X because of all
the windings of the coast. I was merely 
trying to soothe a violent agitation, a 
strange, spectral
delirium in which, willy-nilly, 
phantasms of Simone and Marcelle took 
shape with gruesome
expressions. Little by little, I even 
thought I might kill myself, and, 
taking the revolver in hand, I
managed to lose any sense of words like 
hope or despair, but in my weariness, I 
realized that my
life had to have some meaning all the 
same, and would have one if only 
certain events, defined

as desirable, were to occur. I finally 
accepted being so extraordinarily 
haunted by the names
Simone and Marcelle. Since it was no 
use laughing, I could keep going only 
by accepting or
feigning to imagine a fantastic 
compromise that would confusedly link 
my most disconcerting
moves to theirs.

I slept in a wood during the day, and 
at nightfall I went to Simone's place: 
I passed through the
garden by climbing over the wall. My 
friend's bedroom was lit, and so I cast 
some pebbles
through the window. A few seconds later 
she came down and almost wordlessly we 
headed
towards the beach. We were delighted to 
see one another again. It was dark out, 
and from time to
time I lifted her dress and took hold 
of her cunt, but it didn't make me 
come-quite the opposite.
She sat down and I stretched out at her 
feet. I soon felt that I could not keep 
back my sobs, and I
really cried for a long time on the 
sand.

"What's wrong?" asked Simone.

And she gave me a playful kick. Her 
foot struck the gun in my pocket and a 
fearful bang made us
shriek at the same time. I wasn't 
wounded but I was up on my feet as 
though in a different world.
Simone stood before me, frighteningly 
pale.

That evening we didn't even think of 
masturbating each other, but we 
remained in an endless
embrace, mouth to mouth, something we 
had never done before.

This is how I lived for several days: 
Simone and I would come home late at 
night and sleep in her
room, where I would stay locked in 
until the following night. Simone would 
bring me food, her
mother, having no authority over her 
(the day of the scandal, she had gone 
for a walk the instant
she heard the shrieks), accepted the 
situation without even trying to fathom 
the mystery. As for
the servants, money had for some time 
been ensuring their devotion to Simone.

In fact, it was they who told us of the 
circumstances of Marcelle's confinement 
and even the
name of the sanatorium. From the very 
first day, all we worried about was 
Marcelle: her madness,
the loneliness of her body, the 
possibilities of getting to her, 
helping her to escape, perhaps. One
day, when I tried to rape Simone in her 
bed, she brusquely slipped away:

"You're totally insane, little man," 
she cried, "I'm not interested here, in 
a bed like this, like a
housewife and mother! I'll only do it 
with Marcelle!"

"What are you talking about?" I asked, 
disappointed, but basically agreeing 
with her.

She came back affectionately and said 
in a gentle, dreamy voice:

"Listen, she won't be able to help 
pissing when she sees us... doing it."

I felt a hot, enchanting liquid run 
down my legs, and when she was done, I 
got up and in turn
watered her body, which she 
complaisantly turned to the unchaste 
and faintly murmuring spurt on
her skin. After thus flooding her cunt, 
I smeared come all over her face. Full 
of muck, she
climaxed in a liberating frenzy. She 
deeply inhaled our pungent and happy 
odor: "You smell like
Marcelle," she buoyantly confided after 
a hefty climax, her nose under my wet 
ass.

Obviously Simone and I were sometimes 
taken with a violent desire to fuck. 
But we no longer
thought it could be done without 
Marcelle, whose piercing cries kept 
grating on our ears, for they
were linked to our most violent 
desires. Thus it was that our sexual 
dream kept changing into a
nightmare. Marcelle's smile, her 
freshness, her sobs, the sense of shame 
that made her redden
and, painfully red, tear off her own 
clothes and surrender lovely blond 
buttocks to impure hands,
impure mouths, beyond all the tragic 
delirium that had made her lock herself 
in the wardrobe to
toss off with such abandon that she 
could not help pissing-all these things 
warped our desires,
so that they endlessly racked us: 
Simone, whose conduct during the 
scandal had been more
obscene than ever (sprawled out, she 
had not even covered herself, in fact 
she had flung her legs
apart)-Simone could not forget that the 
unforeseen orgasm provoked by her own 
brazenness,
by Marcelle's howls and the nakedness 
of her writhing limbs, had been more 
powerful than
anything she had ever managed to 
picture before. And her cunt would not 
open to me unless
Marcelle's ghost, raging, reddening, 
frenzied, came to make her brazenness 
overwhelming and
far-reaching, as if the sacrilege were 
to render everything generally dreadful 
and infamous.

At any rate, the swampy regions of the 
cunt (nothing resembles them more than 
the days of flood
and storm or even the suffocating 
gaseous eruptions of volcanoes, and 
they never turn active
except, like storms or volcanoes, with 
something of catastrophe or 
disaster)-those heartbreaking
regions, which Simone, in an abandon 
presaging only violence, allowed me to 
stare at
hypnotically, were nothing for me now 
but the profound, subterranean empire 
of a Marcelle who
was tormented in prison and at the 
mercy of nightmares. There was only one 
thing I understood:
how utterly the orgasms ravaged the 
girl's face with sobs interrupted by 
horrible shrieks.

And Simone, for her part, no longer 
viewed the hot, acrid come that she 
caused to spurt from my
cock without seeing it muck up 
Marcelle's mouth and cunt.

"You could smack her face with your 
come," she confided to me, while 
smearing her cunt "till it
sizzles," as she put it.

4. A Sunspot

Other girls and boys no longer 
interested us. All we could think of 
was Marcelle, and already we
childishly imagined her hanging 
herself, the secret burial, the funeral 
apparitions. Finally, one
evening, after getting the precise 
information, we took our bicycles and 
pedaled off to the
sanatorium where our friend was 
confined. In less than an hour, we had 
ridden the twenty
kilometers separating us from a sort of 
castle within a walled park on an 
isolated cliff overlooking
the sea. We had learned that Marcelle 
was in Room 8, but obviously we would 
have to get inside
the building to find her. Now all we 
could hope for was to climb in her 
window after sawing
through the bars, and we were at a loss 
how to identify her window among thirty 
others, when our
attention was drawn to a strange 
apparition. We had scaled the wall and 
were now in the park,
among trees buffeted by a violent wind, 
when we spied a second-story window 
opening and a
shadow holding a sheet and fastening it 
to one of the bars. The sheet promptly 
smacked in the
gusts, and the window was shut before 
we could recognize the shadow.

It is hard to imagine the harrowing 
racket of that vast white sheet caught 
in the squall. It greatly
outroared the fury of the sea or the 
wind in the trees. That was the first 
time I saw Simone racked
by anything but her own lewdness: she 
huddled against me with a beating heart 
and gaped at the
huge phantom raging in the night as 
though dementia itself had hoisted its 
colors on this
lugubrious chateau.

We were motionless, Simone cowering in 
my arms and I half haggard, when all at 
once the wind
seemed to tatter the clouds, and the 
moon, with a revealing clarity, poured 
sudden light on
something so bizarre and so 
excruciating for us that an abrupt, 
violent sob choked up in Simone's
throat: at the center of the sheet 
flapping and banging in the wind, a 
broad wet stain glowed in the
translucent moonlight...

A few seconds later, new black clouds 
plunged everything into darkness, but I 
stayed on my feet,
suffocating, feeling my hair in the 
wind, and weeping wretchedly, like 
Simone herself, who had
collapsed in the grass, and for the 
first time, her body was quaking with 
huge, childlike sobs.

It was our unfortunate friend, no doubt 
about it, it was Marcelle who had 
opened that lightless
window, Marcelle who had tied that 
stunning signal of distress to the bars 
of her prison. She had

obviously tossed off in bed with such a 
disorder of her senses that she had 
entirely inundated
herself, and it was then that we saw 
her hang the sheet from the window to 
let it dry.

As for myself, I was at a loss about 
what to do in such a park, with that 
bogus château de
plaisance and its repulsively barred 
windows. I walked around the building, 
leaving Simone upset
and sprawling on the grass. I had no 
practical goal, I just wanted to take a 
breath of air by myself.
But then, on the side of the chateau, I 
stumbled upon an unbarred open window 
on the ground
floor; I felt for the gun in my pocket 
and I entered cautiously: it was a very 
ordinary drawing-room.
An electric flashlight helped me to 
reach an antechamber; then a stairway. 
I could not distinguish
anything, I did not get anywhere, the 
rooms were not numbered. Besides, I was 
incapable of
understanding anything, as though I 
were under a spell: at that moment, I 
could not even
understand why I had the idea of 
removing my trousers and continuing 
that anguishing
exploration only in my shirt. And yet I 
stripped off my clothes, piece by 
piece, leaving them on a
chair, keeping only my shoes on. With a 
flashlight in my left hand and the 
revolver in my right
hand, I wandered aimlessly, 
haphazardly. A rustle made me switch 
off my lamp quickly. I stood
motionless, whiling away the time by 
listening to my erratic breath. Long, 
anxious minutes wore
by without my hearing any more noise, 
and so I flashed my light back on, but 
a faint cry sent me
fleeing so swiftly that I forgot my 
clothes on the chair.

I sensed I was being followed: so I 
hurriedly climbed out through the 
window and hid in a garden
lane; but no sooner had I turned to 
observe what might be happening in the 
chateau than I spied
a naked woman in the window frame; she 
jumped into the park as I had done and 
ran off towards
a thorn bush.

Nothing was more bizarre for me in 
those utterly thrilling moments than my 
nudity against the
wind on the path of that unknown 
garden. It was as if I had left the 
earth, especially because the
squall was as violent as ever, but warm 
enough to suggest a brutal entreaty. I 
did not know what
to do with the gun which I still held 
in my hand, for I had no pockets left; 
by charging after the
woman who had run past me unrecognized, 
I would obviously be hunting her down 
to kill her. The
roar of the wrathful elements, the 
raging of the trees and the sheet, also 
helped to prevent me
from discerning anything distinct in my 
will or in my gestures.

All at once, I halted, out of breath: I 
had reached the bushes where the shadow 
had disappeared.
Excited by my revolver, I began looking 
about, when suddenly it seemed as if 
all reality were
tearing apart: a hand, moistened by 
saliva, had grabbed my cock and was 
rubbing it, a
slobbering, burning kiss was planted on 
the root of my ass, the naked chest and 
legs of a woman
pressed against my legs with an 
orgasmic jolt. I scarcely had time to 
spin around when my come

burst in the face of my wonderful 
Simone: clutching my revolver, I was 
swept up by a thrill as
violent as the storm, my teeth 
chattered and my lips foamed, with 
twisted arms I gripped my gun
convulsively, and, willy-nilly, three 
blind, horrifying shots were fired in 
the direction of the chateau.

Drunk and limp, Simone and I had fled 
from one another and raced across the 
park like dogs; the
squall was far too wild now for the 
gunshots to awake any of the sleeping 
tenants in the chateau,
even if the bangs had been audible 
inside. But when we instinctively 
looked up at Marcelle's
window above the sheet slamming in the 
wind, we were greatly surprised to see 
that one of the
bullets had left a star-shaped crack in 
one of the panes. The window shook, 
opened, and the
shadow appeared a second time.

Dumbstruck, as though about to see 
Marcelle bleed and fall dead in the 
window frame, we
remained standing under the strange, 
nearly motionless apparition. Because 
of the furious wind,
we were incapable of even making 
ourselves heard.

"What did you do with your clothes?" I 
asked Simone an instant later. She said 
she had been
looking for me and, unable to track me 
down, she had finally gone to search 
the interior of the
chateau; but before clambering through 
the window, she had undressed, thinking 
she "would feel
more free". And when she had come back 
out after me, terrified by me, she 
found that the wind
had carried off her dress. Meanwhile, 
she kept observing Marcelle, and it 
never crossed her mind
to ask me why I was naked.

The girl in the window disappeared. A 
moment that seemed unending crawled by: 
she switched
on the light in her room. Finally, she 
carried back to breathe the open air 
and gaze at the ocean.
Her sleek, pallid hair was caught in 
the wind, we could make out her 
features: she had not
changed, but now there was something 
wild in her eyes, something restless, 
contrasting with the
still childlike simplicity of her 
features. She looked thirteen rather 
than sixteen. Under her
nightgown, we could distinguish her 
thin but full body, firm, unobtrusive, 
and as beautiful as her
fixed stare.

When she finally caught sight of us, 
the surprise seemed to restore life to 
her face. She called,
but we couldn't hear. We beckoned. She 
blushed up to her ears. Simone, weeping 
almost, while I
lovingly caressed her forehead, sent 
her kisses, to which she responded 
without smiling. Next,
Simone ran her hand down her belly to 
her pubic hair. Marcelle imitated her, 
and poising one foot
on the sill, she exposed a leg sheathed 
in a white silk stocking almost up to 
her blond cunt.
Curiously, she was wearing a white belt 
and white stockings, whereas 
black-haired Simone,
whose cunt was in my hand, was wearing 
a black belt and black stockings.

Meanwhile, the two girls were 
masturbating with terse, brusque 
gestures, face to face in the
howling night. They were nearly 
motionless, and tense, and their eyes 
gaped with unrestrained
joy. But soon, some invisible 
monstrosity appeared to be pulling 
Marcelle away from the bars,
though her left hand clutched them with 
all her might. We saw her tumble back 
into her delirium.
And all that remained before us was an 
empty, glowing window, a rectangular 
hole piercing the
opaque night, showing our aching eyes a 
world composed of lightning and dawn.

5. A Trickle of Blood

Urine is deeply associated for me with 
saltpeter; and lightning, I don't know 
why, with an antique
chamber pot of unglazed earthenware, 
lying abandoned one rainy autumn day on 
the zinc roof of
a provincial wash house. Since that 
first night at the sanatorium, those 
wrenching images were
closely knit, in the obscurest part of 
my brain, with the cunt and the drawn 
and dismal expression
I had sometimes caught on Marcelle's 
face. But then, this chaotic and 
dreadful landscape of my
imagination was suddenly inundated by a 
stream of light and blood, for Marcelle 
could come only
by drenching herself, not with blood, 
but with a spurt of urine that was 
limpid and even illuminated
for me, at first violent and jerky like 
hiccups, then free and relaxed and 
coinciding with an outburst
of superhuman happiness. It is not 
astonishing that the bleakest and most 
leprous aspects of a
dream are merely an urging in that 
direction, an obstinate waiting for 
total joy, like the vision of
that glowing hole, the empty window, 
for example, at the very moment when 
Marcelle lay
sprawling on the floor, endlessly 
inundating it.

But that day, in the rainless tempest, 
Simone and I, our clothing lost, were 
forced to leave the
chateau, fleeing like animals through 
the hostile darkness, our imaginations 
haunted by the
despondency that was bound to take hold 
of Marcelle again, making the wretched 
inmate almost
an embodiment of the fury and terror 
that kept driving our bodies to endless 
debauchery. We
soon found our bicycles and could offer 
one another the irritating and 
theoretically unclean sight
of a naked though shod body on a 
machine. We pedaled rapidly, without 
laughing or speaking,
peculiarly satisfied with our mutual 
presence, akin to one another in the 
common isolation of
lewdness, weariness, and absurdity.

Yet we were both literally perishing of 
fatigue. In the middle of a slope, 
Simone halted, saying she
had the shivers. Our faces, backs, and 
legs were bathed in sweat, and we 
vainly ran our hands
over one another, over the various 
parts of our soaked and burning bodies; 
despite a more and
more vigorous massage, she was all 
trembling flesh and chattering teeth. I 
stripped off one of her
stockings to wipe her body, which gave 
out a hot odor recalling the beds of 
sickness or of

debauchery. Little by little, however, 
she came around to a more bearable 
state, and finally she
offered me her lips as a token of 
gratitude.

I was still extremely agitated. We had 
ten more kilometers to go, and in the 
state we were in, we
obviously had to reach X by dawn. I 
could barely keep upright and despaired 
of ever reaching the
end of this ride through the 
impossible. We had abandoned the real 
world, the one made up
solely of dressed people, and the time 
elapsed since then was already so 
remote as to seem
almost beyond reach. Our personal 
hallucination now developed as 
boundlessly as perhaps the
total nightmare of human society, for 
instance, with earth, sky, and 
atmosphere.

A leather seat clung to Simone's bare 
cunt, which was inevitably jerked by 
the legs pumping up
and down on the spinning pedals. 
Furthermore, the rear wheel vanished 
indefinitely to my eyes,
not only in the bicycle fork but 
virtually in the crevice of the 
cyclist's naked bottom: the rapid
whirling of the dusty tire was also 
directly comparable to both the thirst 
in my throat and the
erection of my penis, destined to 
plunge into the depths of the cunt 
sticking to the bicycle seat.
The wind had died down somewhat, and 
part of the starry sky was visible. And 
it struck me that
death was the sole outcome of my 
erection, and if Simone and I were 
killed, then the universe of
our unbearable personal vision was 
certain to be replaced by the pure 
stars, fully unrelated to any
external gazes and realizing in a cold 
state, without human delays or detours, 
something that
strikes me as the goal of my sexual 
licentiousness: a geometric 
incandescence (among other
things, the coinciding point of life 
and death, being and nothingness), 
perfectly fulgurating.

Yet these images were, of course, tied 
to the contradiction of a prolonged 
state of exhaustion and
an absurd rigidity of my penis. Now it 
was difficult for Simone to see this 
rigidity, partly because of
the darkness, and partly because of the 
swift rising of my left leg, which kept 
hiding my stiffness
by turning the pedal. Yet I felt I 
could see her eyes, aglow in the 
darkness, peer back constantly,
no matter how fatigued, at this 
breaking point of my body, and I 
realized she was tossing off more
and more violently on the seat, which 
was pincered between her buttocks. Like 
myself, she had
not yet drained the tempest evoked by 
the shamelessness of her cunt, and at 
times she let out
husky moans; she was literally torn 
away by joy, and her nude body was 
hurled upon an
embankment with an awful scraping of 
steel on the pebbles and a piercing 
shriek.

I found her inert, her head hanging 
down, a thin trickle of blood running 
from the corner of her
mouth. Horrified to the limit of my 
strength, I pulled up one arm, but it 
fell back inert. I threw
myself upon the lifeless body, 
trembling with fear, and as I clutched 
it in an embrace, I was
overcome with bloody spasms, my lower 
lip drooling and my teeth bared like a 
leering moron.

Meanwhile, Simone was slowly coming to: 
her arm touched me in an involuntary 
movement, and I
quickly returned from the torpor 
overwhelming me after I had besmirched 
what I thought was a
corpse. No injury, no bruise marked the 
body, which was still clad in the 
garter belt and a single
stocking. I took her in my arms and 
carried her down the road, heedless of 
my fatigue; I walked
as fast as I could because the day was 
just breaking, but only a superhuman 
effort allowed me to
reach the villa and happily put my 
marvelous friend alive into her very 
own bed.

The sweat was pouring from my face and 
all over my body, my eyes were bloody 
and swollen,
my ears deafened, my teeth chattering, 
my temples and my heart drumming away. 
But since I
had just rescued the person I loved 
most in the world, and since I thought 
we would soon be
seeing Marcelle, I lay down next to 
Simone's body just as I was, soaked and 
full of coagulated
dust, and soon I drifted off into vague 
nightmares.

6. Simone

One of the most peaceful eras of my 
life was the period following Simone's 
minor accident, which
only left her ill. Whenever her mother 
came, I would step into the bathroom. 
Usually, I took
advantage of these moments to piss or 
even bathe; the first time the woman 
tried to enter, she
was immediately stopped by her daughter:

"Don't go in," she said, "there's a 
naked man in there."

Each time, however, the mother was 
dismissed before long, and I would take 
my place again in a
chair next to the sickbed. I smoked 
cigarettes, went through newspapers, 
and if there were any
items about crime or violence, I would 
read them aloud. From time to time, I 
would carry a
feverish Simone to the bathroom to help 
her pee, and then I would carefully 
wash her on the
bidet. She was extremely weak and 
naturally I never stroked her 
seriously; but nevertheless, she
soon delighted in having me throw eggs 
into the toilet bowl, hard-boiled eggs, 
which sank, and
shells sucked out in various degrees to 
obtain varying levels of immersion. She 
would sit for a
long time, gazing at the eggs. Then she 
would settle on the toilet to view them 
under her cunt
between the parted thighs; and finally, 
she would have me flush the bowl.

Another game was to crack a fresh egg 
on the edge of the bidet and empty it 
under her:
sometimes she would piss on it, 
sometimes she made me strip naked and 
swallow the raw egg
from the bottom of the bidet. She did 
promise that as soon as she was well 
again, she would do
the same for me and also for Marcelle.

At that time, we imagined Marcelle, 
with her dress tucked up, but her body 
covered and her feet
shod: we would put her in a bath tub 
half filled with fresh eggs, and she 
would pee while crushing
them. Simone also daydreamed about my 
holding Marcelle, this time with 
nothing on but her
garter belt and stockings, her cunt 
aloft, her legs bent, and her head 
down; Simone herself, in a
bathrobe drenched in hot water and thus 
clinging to her body but exposing her 
bosom, would
then get up on a white enameled chair 
with a cork seat. I would arouse her 
breasts from a
distance by lifting the tips on the 
heated barrel of a long service 
revolver that had been loaded
and just fired (first of all, this 
would shake us up, and secondly, it 
would give the barrel a pungent
smell of powder). At the same time, she 
would pour a jar of dazzling white 
crème fraîche on
Marcelle's gray anus, and she would 
also urinate freely in her robe or, if 
the robe were open, on
Marcelle’s back or head, while I could 
piss on Marcelle from the other side (I 
would certainly piss
on her breasts). Furthermore, Marcelle 
herself could fully inundate me if she 
liked, for while I held
her up, her thighs would be gripping my 
neck. And she could also stick my cock 
in her mouth, and
what not.

It was after such dreams that Simone 
would ask me to bed her down on 
blankets by the toilet,
and she would rest her head on the rim 
of the bowl and fix her wide eyes on 
the white eggs. I
myself settled comfortably next to her 
so that our cheeks and temples might 
touch. We were
calmed by the long contemplation. The 
gulping gurgle of the flushing water 
always amused
Simone, making her forget her obsession 
and ultimately restoring her high 
spirits.

At last, one day at six, when the 
oblique sunshine was directly lighting 
the bathroom, a half
sucked egg was suddenly invaded by the 
water, and after filling up with a 
bizarre noise, it was
shipwrecked before our very eyes. This 
incident was so extraordinarily 
meaningful to Simone that
her body tautened and she had a long 
climax, virtually drinking my left eye 
between her lips.
Then, without leaving the eye, which 
was sucked as obstinately as a breast, 
she sat down,
wrenching my head toward her on the 
seat, and she pissed noisily on the 
bobbing eggs with total
vigor and satisfaction.

By then she could be regarded as cured, 
and she demonstrated her joy by 
speaking to me at
length about various intimate things, 
whereas ordinarily she never spoke 
about herself or me.
Smiling, she admitted that an instant 
ago, she had felt a strong urge to 
relieve herself completely,
but had held back for the sake of 
greater pleasure. Truly, the urge 
bloated her belly and
particularly made her cunt swell up 
like a ripe fruit; and when I passed my 
hand under the sheets
and her cunt gripped it firm and tight, 
she remarked that she was still in the 
same state and that it
was inordinately pleasant. Upon my 
asking what the word urinate reminded 
her of, she replied:
terminate, the eyes, with a razor, 
something red, the sun. And egg? A 
calf's eye, because of the

color of the head (the calf’s head) and 
also because the white of the egg was 
the white of the
eye, and the yolk the eyeball. The eye, 
she said, was egg-shaped. She asked me 
to promise that
when we could go outdoors, I would 
fling eggs into the sunny air and break 
them with shots from
my gun, and when I replied that it was 
out of the question, she talked on and 
on, trying to reason
me into it. She played gaily with 
words, speaking about breaking eggs, 
and then breaking eyes,
and her arguments became more and more 
unreasonable.

She added that, for her, the smell of 
the ass was the smell of powder, a jet 
of urine a "gunshot
seen as a light;" each of her buttocks 
was a peeled hard-boiled egg. We agreed 
to send for hot
soft-boiled eggs without shells, for 
the toilet, and she promised that when 
she now sat on the
seat, she would ease herself fully on 
those eggs. Her cunt was still in my 
hand and in the state
she had described; and after her 
promise, a storm began brewing little 
by little in my innermost
depth-I was reflecting more and more.

It is fair to say that the room of a 
bedridden invalid is just the right 
place for gradually
rediscovering childhood lewdness. I 
gently sucked Simone's breast while 
waiting for the softboiled eggs, and 
she ran her fingers through my hair. 
Her mother was the one who brought us 
the
eggs, but I didn't even turn around, I 
assumed it was a maid, and I kept on 
sucking the breast
contentedly. Nor was I ultimately 
disturbed when I recognized the voice, 
but since she remained
and I couldn't forego even one instant 
of my pleasure, I thought of pulling 
down my trousers as for
a call of nature, not ostentatiously, 
but merely hoping she would leave and 
delighted at going
beyond all limits. When she finally 
decided to walk out and vainly ponder 
over her dismay
elsewhere, the night was already 
gathering, and we switched on the lamp 
in the bathroom.
Simone settled on the toilet, and we 
each ate one of the hot eggs with salt. 
With the three that
were left, I softly caressed her body, 
gliding them between her buttocks and 
thighs, then I slowly
dropped them into the water one by one. 
Finally, after viewing them for a 
while, immersed, white,
and still hot (this was the first time 
she was seeing them peeled, that is 
naked, drowned under her
beautiful cunt), Simone continued the 
immersion with a plopping noise akin to 
that of the softboiled eggs.

But I ought to say that nothing of the 
sort ever happened between us again, 
and, with one
exception, no further eggs ever came up 
in our conversations; nevertheless, if 
we chanced to
notice one or more, we could not help 
reddening when our eyes met in a silent 
and murky
interrogation.

At any rate, it will be shown by the 
end of this tale, that this 
interrogation was not to remain
without an answer indefinitely, and 
above all, that this unexpected answer 
is necessary for

measuring the immensity of the void 
that yawned before us, without our 
knowledge, during our
singular entertainments with the eggs.

7. Marcelle

By a sort of shared modesty, Simone and 
I had always avoided talking about the 
most important
objects of our obsessions. That was why 
the word egg was dropped from our 
vocabulary, and we
never spoke about the kind of interest 
we had in one another, even less about 
what Marcelle
meant to us. We spent all of Simone's 
illness in a bedroom, looking forward 
to when we could go
back to Marcelle, as nervously as we 
had once waited for the end of the last 
lesson in school, and
so all we talked about was the day we 
would return to the chateau. I had 
prepared a small cord, a
thick, knotted rope, and a hacksaw, all 
of which Simone examined with the 
keenest interest,
peering attentively at each knot and 
section of the rope. I also managed to 
find the bicycles,
which I had concealed in a thicket the 
day of our tumble, and I meticulously 
oiled the various
parts, the gears, ball bearings, 
sprockets, etc. I then attached a pair 
of footrests to my own
bicycle so that I could seat one of the 
girls behind. Nothing could be easier, 
at least for the time
being, than to have Marcelle living in 
Simone's room secretly like myself. We 
would simply be
forced to share the bed (and we would 
inevitably have to use the same 
bathtub, etc.). But a good
six weeks passed before Simone could 
pedal after me reasonably well to the 
sanatorium. Like the
previous time, we left at night: in 
fact, I still kept out of sight during 
the day, and this time there
was certainly every reason for 
remaining inconspicuous. I was in a 
hurry to arrive at the place that
I dimly regarded as a "haunted castle," 
due to the association of the words 
sanatorium and castle,
and also the memory of the phantom 
sheet and the thought of the lunatics 
in a huge silent
dwelling at night. But now, to my 
surprise, even though I was ill at ease 
anywhere in the world, I
felt at bottom as if l were going home. 
And that was indeed my impression when 
we jumped over
the park wall and saw the huge building 
stretching out ahead beyond the trees: 
only Marcelle's
window was still aglow and wide open. 
Taking some pebbles from a lane, we 
threw them into her
chamber and they promptly summoned the 
girl, who quickly recognized us and 
obeyed our
gesture of putting a finger on our 
lips. But of course we also held up the 
knotted rope to let her
understand what we were doing this 
time. I hurled the cord up to her with 
the aid of a stone, and
she threw it back after looping it 
around a bar. There were no 
difficulties, the big rope was hoisted
by Marcelle and fastened to the bar, 
and I scrambled all the way up.

Marcelle flinched when I tried to kiss 
her. She merely watched me very 
attentively as I started
filing away at a bar. Since she only 
had a bathrobe on, I softly told her to 
get dressed so she
could come with us. She simply turned 
her back to pull flesh-colored 
stockings over her legs,
securing them on a belt of bright red 
ribbons that brought out a rump with a 
perfect shape and an

exceptionally fine skin. I continued 
filing, bathed in sweat because of both 
my effort and what I
saw. Her back still towards me, 
Marcelle pulled a blouse over long, 
flat hips, whose straight lines
were admirably terminated by the 
buttocks when she had one foot on a 
chair. She did not slip on
any panties, only a pleated gray woolen 
skirt and a sweater with very tiny 
black, white, and red
checks. After stepping into flat-heeled 
shoes, she came over to the window and 
sat down close
enough to me so that my one hand could 
caress her head, her lovely short hair, 
so sleek and so
blond that it actually looked pale. She 
gazed at me affectionately and seemed 
touched by my
wordless joy at seeing her.

"Now we can get married, can't we?" she 
finally said, gradually won over. "It's 
very bad here, we
suffer..."

At that point, I would never have 
dreamt for even an instant that I could 
do anything but devote
the rest of my life to such an unreal 
apparition. She let me give her a long 
kiss on her forehead
and her eyes, and when one of her hands 
happened to touch my leg, she looked at 
me wideeyed, but before withdrawing her 
hand, she ran it over my clothes 
absent-mindedly.

After long work, I succeeded in cutting 
through the horrid bar. I pulled it 
aside with all my strength,
which left enough space for her to 
squeeze through. She did so, and I 
helped her descend,
climbing down underneath, which forced 
me to see the top of her thigh and even 
to touch it when
I supported her. Reaching the ground, 
she snuggled in my arms and kissed my 
mouth with all her
strength, while Simone, sitting at our 
feet, her eyes wet with tears, flung 
her hands around
Marcelle's legs, hugging her knees and 
thighs. At first, she only rubbed her 
cheek against the
thigh, but then, unable to restrain a 
huge surge of joy, she finally yanked 
the body apart, pressing
her lips to the cunt, which she 
greedily devoured.

However, Simone and I realized that 
Marcelle grasped absolutely nothing of 
what was going on
and she was actually incapable of 
telling one situation from another. 
Thus she smiled, imagining
how aghast the director of the "haunted 
castle" would be to see her strolling 
through the garden
with her husband. Also, she was 
scarcely aware of Simone's existence; 
mirthfully, she at times
mistook her for a wolf because of her 
black hair, her silence, and because 
Simone's head was
docilely rubbing Marcelle's thigh, like 
a dog nuzzling his master's leg. 
Nonetheless, when I spoke
to Marcelle about the "haunted castle," 
she did not ask me to explain; she 
understood that this
was the building where she had been 
wickedly locked up. And whenever she 
thought of it, her
terror pulled her away from me as 
though she had seen something pass 
through the trees. I
watched her uneasily, and since my face 
was already hard and somber, I too 
frightened her, and
almost at the same instant she asked me 
to protect her until the Cardinal 
returned.

We were lying in the moonlight by the 
edge of a forest. We wanted to rest a 
while during our trip
back and we especially wanted to 
embrace and stare at Marcelle.

"But who is the Cardinal?" Simone asked 
her.

"The man who locked me in the 
wardrobe," said Marcelle.

"But why is he a cardinal?" I cried.

She replied: "Because he is the priest 
of the guillotine."

I now recalled Marcelle's dreadful fear 
when she left the wardrobe, and 
particularly two details: I
had been wearing a blinding red 
carnival novelty, a Jacobin liberty 
cap; furthermore, because of
the deep cuts in a girl I had raped, my 
face, clothes, hands-all parts of me 
were stained with
blood.

Thus, in her terror, Marcelle confused 
a cardinal, a priest of the guillotine, 
with the blood-smeared
executioner wearing a liberty cap: a 
bizarre overlapping of piety and 
abomination for priests
explained the confusion, which, for me, 
had remained attached to both my hard 
reality and the
horror continually aroused by the 
compulsiveness of my actions.

8. The Open Eyes of the Dead Woman

For a moment, I was totally helpless 
after this unexpected discovery; and so 
was Simone.
Marcelle was now half asleep in my 
arms, so that we didn't know what to 
do. Her dress was
pulled up exposing the gray pussy 
between red ribbons at the end of long 
thighs, and it had
thereby become an extraordinary 
hallucination in a world so frail that 
a mere breath might have
changed us into light. We didn't dare 
budge, and all we desired was for that 
unreal immobility to
last as long as possible, and for 
Marcelle to fall sound asleep.

My mind reeled in some kind of 
exhausting vertigo, and I don't know 
what the outcome would
have been if Simone, whose worried gaze 
was darting between my eyes and 
Marcelle's nudity,
had not made a sudden, gentle movement: 
she opened her thighs, saying in a 
blank voice that
she couldn't hold back any longer.

She soaked her dress in a long 
convulsion that fully denuded her and 
promptly made me spurt a
wave of semen in my clothes.

I stretched out in the grass, my skull 
on a large, flat rock and my eyes 
staring straight up at the
Milky Way, that strange breath of 
astral sperm and heavenly urine across 
the cranial vault formed
by the ring of constellations: that 
open crack at the summit of the sky, 
apparently made of
ammoniac vapors shining in the 
immensity (in empty space, where they 
burst forth absurdly like a
rooster's crow in total silence), a 
broken egg, a broken eye, or my own 
dazzled skull weighing
down the rock, bouncing symmetrical 
images back to infinity. The nauseating 
crow of a rooster in
particular coincided with my own life, 
that is to say, now, the Cardinal, 
because of the crack, the
red color, the discordant shrieks he 
provoked in the wardrobe, and also 
because one cuts the
throats of roosters.

To others, the universe seems decent 
because decent people have gelded eyes. 
That is why
they fear lewdness. They are never 
frightened by the crowing of a rooster 
or when strolling under
a starry heaven. In general, people 
savor the "pleasures of the flesh" only 
on condition that they
be insipid.

But as of then, no doubt existed for 
me: I did not care for what is known as 
"pleasures of the
flesh" because they really are insipid; 
I cared only for what is classified as 
"dirty." On the other
hand, I was not even satisfied with the 
usual debauchery, because the only 
thing it dirties is
debauchery itself, while, in some way 
or other, anything sublime and 
perfectly pure is left intact by
it. My kind of debauchery soils not 
only my body and my thoughts, but also 
anything I may
conceive in its course, that is to say, 
the vast starry universe, which merely 
serves as a backdrop.

I associate the moon with the vaginal 
blood of mothers, sisters, that is, the 
menstrua with their
sickening stench...

I loved Marcelle without mourning her. 
If she died, then it was my fault. If l 
had nightmares, if l
sometimes locked myself up in a cellar 
for hours at a time precisely because I 
was thinking about
Marcelle, I would nevertheless still be 
prepared to start all over again, for 
instance by ducking her
hair, head down, in a toilet bowl. But 
since she is dead, I have nothing left 
but certain
catastrophes that bring me to her at 
times when I least expect it. 
Otherwise, I cannot possibly
perceive the least kinship now between 
the dead girl and myself, which makes 
most of my days
inevitably dreary.

I will merely report here that Marcelle 
hanged herself after a dreadful 
incident. She recognized the
huge bridal wardrobe, and her teeth 
started chattering: she instantly 
realized upon looking at me
that I was the man she called the 
Cardinal, and when she began shrieking, 
there was no other
way for me to stop that desperate 
howling than to leave the room. By the 
time Simone and I
returned she was hanging inside the 
wardrobe...

I cut the rope, but she was quite dead. 
We laid her out on the carpet. Simone 
saw I was getting a
hard-on and she started tossing me off: 
I too stretched out on the carpet. It 
was impossible to do
otherwise; Simone was still a virgin, 
and I fucked her for the first time, 
next to the corpse. It was
very painful for both of us, but we 
were glad precisely because it was 
painful. Simone stood up
and gazed at the corpse. Marcelle had 
become a total stranger, and in fact, 
so had Simone at
that moment. I no longer cared at all 
for either Simone or Marcelle. Even if 
someone had told me
it was I who had just died, I would not 
even have been astonished, so alien 
were these events to
me. I observed Simone, and, as I 
precisely recall, my only pleasure was 
in the smutty things
Simone was doing, for the corpse was 
very irritating to her, as though she 
could not bear the
thought that this creature, so similar 
to her, could not feel her anymore. The 
open eyes were
more irritating than anything else. 
Even when Simone drenched the face, 
those eyes,
extraordinarily, did not close. We were 
perfectly calm, all three of us, and 
that was the most
hopeless part of it. Any boredom in the 
world is linked, for me, to that moment 
and, above all, to
an obstacle as ridiculous as death. But 
that won't prevent me from thinking 
back to that time with
no revulsion and even with a sense of 
complicity. Basically, the lack of 
excitement made
everything far more absurd, and thus 
Marcelle was closer to me dead than in 
her lifetime,
inasmuch as absurd existence, so I 
imagine, has all the prerogatives.

As for the fact that Simone dared to 
piss on the corpse, whether in boredom 
or, at worst, in
irritation: it mainly goes to prove how 
impossible it was for us to understand 
what was happening,
and of course, it is no more 
understandable today than it was then. 
Simone, being truly incapable
of conceiving death such as one 
normally considers it, was frightened 
and furious, but in no way
awestruck. Marcelle belonged to us so 
deeply in our isolation that we could 
not see her as just
another corpse. Nothing about her death 
could be measured by a common standard, 
and the
contradictory impulses overtaking us in 
this circumstance neutralized one 
another, leaving us
blind and, as it were, very remote from 
anything we touched, in a world where 
gestures have no
carrying power, like voices in a space 
that is absolutely soundless.

To avoid the bother of a police 
investigation, we instantly took off 
for Spain, where Simone was
counting on our disappearing with the 
help of a fabulously rich Englishman, 
who had offered to
support her and would be more likely 
than anyone else to show interest in 
our plight.

The villa was abandoned in the middle 
of the night. We had no trouble 
stealing a boat, reaching
an obscure point on the Spanish coast, 
and burning the vessel with the aid of 
two drums of petrol
that we had taken along, as a 
precautionary measure, from the garage 
of the villa. Simone left me
concealed in a wood during the day and 
went to look for the Englishman in San 
Sebastian. She
only came back at nightfall, but 
driving a magnificent automobile, with 
suitcases full of linen and
rich clothing.

Simone said that Sir Edmund would join 
us in Madrid and that all day long he 
had been plying her
with the most detailed questions about 
Marcelle's death, making her draw 
diagrams and
sketches. Finally he had told a servant 
to buy a wax mannequin with a blonde 
wig; he had then
laid the figure out on the floor and 
asked Simone to urinate on its face, on 
the open eyes, in the
same position as she had urinated on 
the eyes of the corpse: during all that 
time, Sir Edmund had
not even touched her.

However, there had been a great change 
in Simone after Marcelle's suicide-she 
kept staring
into space all the time, looking as if 
she belonged to something other than 
the terrestrial world,
where almost everything bored her; or 
if she was still attached to this 
world, then purely by way of
orgasms, which were rare but 
incomparably more violent than before. 
These orgasms were as
different from normal climaxes as, say, 
the mirth of savage Africans from that 
of Occidentals. In
fact, though the savages may sometimes 
laugh as moderately as whites, they 
also have longlasting spasms, with all 
parts of the body in violent release, 
and they go whirling willy-nilly, 
flailing
their arms about wildly, shaking their 
bellies, necks, and chests, and 
chortling and gulping
horribly. As for Simone, she would 
first open uncertain eyes, at some lewd 
and dismal sight...

For example, Sir Edmund had a cramped, 
windowless pigsty, where one day he 
locked up a
petite and luscious streetwalker from 
Madrid; wearing only cami-knickers, she 
collapsed in a pool
of liquid manure under the bellies of 
the grunting swine. Once the door was 
shut, Simone had me
fuck her again and again in front of 
that door, with her ass in the mud, 
under a fine drizzle of rain,
while Sir Edmund tossed off:

Gasping and slipping away from me, 
Simone grabbed her behind in both hands 
and threw back
her head, which banged violently 
against the ground; she tensed 
breathlessly for a few seconds,
pulling with all her might on the 
fingernails buried in her buttocks, 
then tore herself away at one

swoop and thrashed about on the ground 
like a headless chicken, hurting 
herself with a terrible
bang on the door fittings. Sir Edmund 
gave her his wrist to bite on and allay 
the spasm that kept
shaking her, and I saw that her face 
was smeared with saliva and blood.

After these huge fits, she always came 
to nestle in my arms; she settled her 
little bottom
comfortably in my large hands and 
remained there for a long time without 
moving or speaking,
huddled like a little girl, but always 
somber.

Sir Edmund deployed his ingenuity at 
providing us with obscene spectacles at 
random, but
Simone still preferred bullfights. 
There were actually three things about 
bullfights that fascinated
her: the first, when the bull comes 
hurtling out of the bullpen like a big 
rat; the second, when its
horns plunge all the way into the flank 
of a mare; the third, when that 
ludicrous, raw-boned mare
gallops across the arena, lashing out 
unseasonably and dragging a huge, vile 
bundle of bowels
between her thighs in the most dreadful 
wan colors, a pearly white, pink, and 
gray. Simone's
heart throbbed fastest when the 
exploding bladder dropped its mass of 
mare's urine on the sand
in one quick plop.

She was on tenterhooks from start to 
finish at the bullfight, in terror 
(which of course mainly
expressed a violent desire) at the 
thought of seeing the toreador hurled 
up by one of the
monstrous lunges of the horns when the 
bull made its endless, blindly raging 
dashes at the void
of colored cloths. And there is 
something else I ought to say: when the 
bull makes its quick,
brutal, thrusts over and over again 
into the matador's cape, barely grazing 
the erect line of the
body, any spectator has that feeling of 
total and repeated lunging typical of 
the game of coitus.
The utter nearness of death is also 
felt in the same way. But these series 
of prodigious passes
are rare. Thus, each time they occur, 
they unleash a veritable delirium in 
the arena, and it is well
known that at such thrilling instants 
the women come by merely rubbing their 
thighs together.

Apropos bullfights, Sir Edmund once 
told Simone that until quite recently, 
certain virile Spaniards,
mostly occasional amateur toreadors, 
used to ask the caretaker of the arena 
to bring them the
fresh, roasted balls of one of the 
first bulls to be killed. They received 
them at their seats, in the
front row of the arena, and ate them 
while watching the killing of the next 
few bulls. Simone took a
keen interest in this tale, and since 
we were attending the first major 
bullfight of the year that
Sunday, she begged Sir Edmund to get 
her the balls of the first bull, but 
added one condition:
they had to be raw.

"I say," objected Sir Edmund, "whatever 
do you want with raw balls? You 
certainly don't intend to
eat raw balls now, do you?"

"I want to have them before me on a 
plate," concluded Simone.

10. Granero's Eye

On May 7, 1922, the toreadors La Rosa, 
Lalanda, and Granero were to fight in 
the arena of
Madrid; the last two were renowned as 
the best matadors in Spain, and Granero 
was generally
considered superior to Lalanda. He had 
only just turned twenty, yet he was 
already extremely
popular, being handsome, tall and of a 
still childlike simplicity. Simone had 
been deeply interested
in his story, and, exceptionally, had 
shown genuine pleasure when Sir Edmund 
announced that
the celebrated bull-killer had agreed 
to dine with us the evening of the 
fight.

Granero stood out from the rest of the 
matadors because there was nothing of 
the butcher about
him; he looked more like a very manly 
Prince Charming with a perfectly 
elegant figure. In this
respect, the matador's costume is quite 
expressive, for it safeguards the 
straight line shooting up
so rigid and erect every time the 
lunging bull grazes the body and 
because the pants so tightly
sheathe the behind. A bright red cloth 
and a brilliant sword (before the dying 
bull whose hide
steams with sweat and blood) complete 
the metamorphosis, bringing out the 
most captivating
feature of the game. One must also bear 
in mind the typically torrid Spanish 
sky, which never has
the color or harshness one imagines: it 
is just perfectly sunny with a dazzling 
but mellow sheen,
hot, turbid, at times even unreal when 
the combined intensities of light and 
heat suggest the
freedom of the senses.

Now this extreme unreality of the solar 
blaze was so closely attached to 
everything happening
around me during the bullfight on May 
7, that the only objects I have ever 
carefully preserved are
a round paper fan, half yellow, half 
blue, that Simone had that day, and a 
small illustrated
brochure with a description of all the 
circumstances and a few photographs. 
Later on, during an
embarkment, the small valise containing 
those two souvenirs tumbled into the 
sea, and was
fished out by an Arab with a long pole, 
which is why the objects are in such a 
bad state. But I
need them to fix that event to the 
earthly soil, to a geographic point and 
a precise date, an event
that my imagination compulsively 
pictures as a simple vision of solar 
deliquescence. The first bull,
the one whose balls Simone looked 
forward to having served raw on a 
plate, was a kind of black
monster, who shot out of the pen so 
quickly that despite all efforts and 
all shouts, he
disemboweled three horses in a row 
before an orderly fight could take 
place; one horse and rider
were hurled aloft together, loudly 
crashing down behind the horns. But 
when Granero faced the
bull, the combat was launched with 
brio, proceeding amid a frenzy of 
cheers. The young man
sent the furious beast racing around 
him in his pink cape; each time, his 
body was lifted by a sort

of spiraling jet, and he just barely 
eluded a frightful impact. In the end, 
the death of the solar
monster was performed cleanly, with the 
beast blinded by the scrap of red 
cloth, the sword deep
in the blood-smeared body. An 
incredible ovation resounded as the 
bull staggered to its knees
with the uncertainty of a drunkard, 
collapsed with its legs sticking up, 
and died.

Simone, who sat between Sir Edmund and 
myself, witnessed the killing with an 
exhilaration at
least equal to mine, and she refused to 
sit down again when the interminable 
acclamation for the
young man was over. She took my hand 
wordlessly and led me to an outer 
courtyard of the filthy
arena, where the stench of equine and 
human urine was suffocating because of 
the great heat. I
grabbed Simone's cunt, and she seized 
my furious cock through my trousers. We 
stepped into a
stinking shithouse, where sordid flies 
whirled about in a sunbeam. Standing 
here, I exposed
Simone's cunt, and into her blood-red, 
slobbery flesh I stuck my fingers, then 
my penis, which
entered that cavern of blood while I 
tossed off her ass, thrusting my bony 
middle finger deep
inside. At the same time, the roofs of 
our mouths cleaved together in a storm 
of saliva.

A bull's orgasm is not more powerful 
than the one that wrenched through our 
loins to tear us to
shreds, though without shaking my thick 
penis out of that stuffed vulva, which 
was gorged with
come.

Our hearts were still booming in our 
chests, which were equally burning and 
equally lusting to
press stark naked against wet unslaked 
hands, and Simone's cunt was still as 
greedy as before
and my cock stubbornly rigid, as we 
returned to the first row of the arena. 
But when we arrived at
our places next to Sir Edmund, there, 
in broad sunlight, on Simone's seat, 
lay a white dish
containing two peeled balls, glands the 
size and shape of eggs, and of a pearly 
whiteness, faintly
bloodshot, like the globe of an eye: 
they had just been removed from the 
first bull, a black-haired
creature, into whose body Granero had 
plunged his sword.

"Here are the raw balls," Sir Edmund 
said to Simone in his British accent.

Simone was already kneeling before the 
plate, peering at it in absorbed 
interest, but in something
of a quandary. It seemed she wanted to 
do something but didn't know how to go 
about it, which
exasperated her. I picked up the dish 
to let her sit down, but she grabbed it 
away from me with a
categorical "no" and returned it to the 
stone seat.

Sir Edmund and I were growing annoyed 
at being the focus of our neighbors' 
attention just when
the bullfight was slackening. I leaned 
over and whispered to Simone, asking 
what had got into
her.

"Idiot!" she replied. "Can't you see I 
want to sit on the plate, and all these 
people watching!"

"That's absolutely out of the 
question," I rejoined, "sit down."

At the same time, I took away the dish 
and made her sit, and I stared at her 
to let her know that I
understood, that I remembered the dish 
of milk, and that this renewed desire 
was unsettling me.
From that moment on, neither of us 
could keep from fidgeting, and this 
state of malaise was
contagious enough to affect Sir Edmund. 
I ought to say that the fight had 
become boring,
unpugnacious bulls were facing matadors 
who didn't know what to do next; and to 
top it off, since
Simone had demanded seats in the sun, 
we were trapped in something like an 
immense vapor of
light and muggy heat, which parched our 
throats as it bore down upon us.

It really was totally out of the 
question for Simone to lift her dress 
and place her bare behind in
the dish of raw balls. All she could do 
was hold the dish in her lap. I told 
her I would like to fuck
her again before Granero returned to 
fight the fourth bull, but she refused, 
and she sat there,
keenly involved, despite everything, in 
the disembowelments of horses, 
followed, as she
childishly put it, by "death and 
destruction," namely the cataract of 
bowels.

Little by little, the sun's radiance 
sucked us into an unreality that fitted 
our malaise-the wordless
and powerless desire to explode and get 
up off our behinds. We grimaced, 
because our eyes
were blinded and because we were 
thirsty, our senses ruffled, and there 
was no possibility of
quenching our desires. We three had 
managed to share in the morose 
dissolution that leaves no
harmony between the various spasms of 
the body. We were so far gone that even 
Granero's
return could not pull us out of that 
stupefying absorption. Besides, the 
bull opposite him was
distrustful and seemed unresponsive; 
the combat went on just as drearily as 
before.

The events that followed were without 
transition or connection, not because 
they weren't actually
related, but because my attention was 
so absent as to remain absolutely 
dissociated. In just a few
seconds: first, Simone bit into one of 
the raw balls, to my dismay; then 
Granero advanced
towards the bull, waving his scarlet 
cloth; finally, almost at once, Simone, 
with a blood-red face
and a suffocating lewdness, uncovered 
her long white thighs up to her moist 
vulva, into which she
slowly and surely fitted the second 
pale globule-Granero was thrown back by 
the bull and
wedged against the balustrade; the 
horns struck the balustrade three times 
at full speed; at the
third blow, one horn plunged into the 
right eye and through the head. A 
shriek of unmeasured
horror coincided with a brief orgasm 
for Simone, who was lifted up from the 
stone seat only to be

flung back with a bleeding nose, under 
a blinding sun; men instantly rushed 
over to haul away
Granero's body, the right eye dangling 
from the head.

11. Under the Sun of Seville

Thus, two globes of equal size and 
consistency had suddenly been propelled 
in opposite
directions at once. One, the white ball 
of the bull, had been thrust into the 
"pink and dark" cunt
that Simone had bared in the crowd; the 
other, a human eye, had spurted from 
Granero's head
with the same force as a bundle of 
innards from a belly. This coincidence, 
tied to death and to a
sort of urinary liquefaction of the 
sky, first brought us back to Marcelle 
in a moment that was so
brief and almost insubstantial, yet so 
uneasily vivid that I stepped forward 
like a sleepwalker as
though about to touch her at eye level.

Needless to say, everything was 
promptly back to normal, though with 
blinding obsessions in the
hour after Granero's death. Simone was 
in such a foul mood that she told Sir 
Edmund she
wouldn't spend another day in Madrid; 
she was very anxious to see Seville 
because of its
reputation as a city of pleasure.

Sir Edmund took a heady delight in 
satisfying the whims of "the simplest 
and most angelic
creature ever to walk the earth," and 
so the next day he accompanied us to 
Seville, where we
found an even more liquefying heat and 
light than in Madrid. A lavish 
abundance of flowers in the
streets, geraniums and rose laurels, 
helped to put our senses on edge.

Simone walked about naked under a white 
dress that was flimsy enough to hint at 
the red garter
belt underneath and, in certain 
positions, even at her pussy. 
Furthermore, everything in this city
contributed to making her radiate such 
sensuality that when we passed through 
the torrid streets,
I often saw cocks stretching trousers.

Indeed, we virtually never stopped 
having sex. We avoided orgasms and we 
went sightseeing, for
this was the only way to keep from 
having my penis endlessly immersed in 
her fur. But we did
take advantage of any opportunities 
when we were out. We would leave one 
convenient place
with never any goal but to find another 
like it. An empty museum room, a 
stairway, a garden path,
lined with high bushes, an open church, 
deserted alleys in the evenings-we 
walked until we
found the right place, and the instant 
we found it, I would open the girl's 
body by lifting one of her
legs and shoving my cock to the bottom 
of her cunt in one swoop. A few moments 
later, I would
pull my steaming member from its 
stable, and our promenade would 
continue almost aimlessly.
Usually, Sir Edmund would follow at a 
distance in order to surprise us: he 
would turn purple, but

he never came close. And if he 
masturbated, he would do it discreetly, 
not for caution's sake, of
course, but because he never did 
anything unless standing isolated and 
almost utterly steady,
with a dreadful muscular contraction.

"This is a very interesting place," he 
said one day in regard to a church, 
"it's the church of Don
Juan."

"So what?" replied Simone.

"Stay here with me," Sir Edmund said to 
me. "And you Simone, you ought to go 
round this church
all by yourself."

"What an awful idea!"

Nevertheless, however awful the idea, 
it aroused her curiosity, and she went 
in by herself while
we waited in the street.

Five minutes later, Simone reappeared 
at the threshold of the church. We were 
dumbstruck: not
only was she guffawing her head off, 
but she couldn't speak or stop 
laughing, so that, partly by
contagion, partly because of the 
intense light, I began laughing as hard 
as she, and so did Sir
Edmund to a certain extent.

"Bloody girl," he said. "Can't you 
explain? By the by, we're laughing 
right over the tomb of Don
Juan!"

And laughing even harder, he pointed at 
a large church brass at our feet. It 
was the tomb of the
church's founder, who, the guides 
claimed, was Don Juan: after repenting, 
he had himself buried
under the doorstep so that the faithful 
would trudge over his corpse when 
entering or leaving their
haunt.

But now our wild laughter burst out 
again tenfold. In our mirth, Simone had 
lightly pissed down
her leg, and a tiny trickle of water 
had landed on the brass.

We noted a further effect of her 
accident: the thin dress, being wet, 
stuck to her body, and since
the cloth was now fully transparent, 
Simone's attractive belly and thighs 
were revealed with
particular lewdness, a dark patch 
between the red ribbons of her garter 
belt.

"All I can do is go into the church," 
said Simone, a bit calmer, "it'll dry." 
We burst into a larger
space, where Sir Edmund and I vainly 
looked for the comical sight that the 
girl had been unable
to explain. The room was relatively 
cool, and the light came from windows, 
filtering through
curtains of a bright red, transparent 
cretonne. The ceiling was of carved 
woodwork, the walls
were plastered but encumbered with 
religious gewgaws more or less gilded. 
The entire back wall
was covered from floor to rafters by an 
altar and a giant Baroque retable of 
gilded wood; the
involved and contorted decorations 
conjured up India, with deep shadows 
and golden glows, and
the whole altar at first seemed very 
mysterious and just right for sex. At 
either side of the
entrance door hung two famous canvases 
by the painter Valdès Leal, pictures of 
decomposing
corpses: interestingly, one of the eye 
sockets was being gnawed through by a 
rat. Yet in all these
things, there was nothing funny to be 
found.

Quite the contrary: the whole place was 
sumptuous and sensuous, the play of 
shadows and light
from the red curtains, the coolness and 
a strong pungent aroma of blossoming 
oleander, plus the
dress sticking to Simone's 
pussy-everything was urging me to burst 
loose and bare that wet
cunt on the floor, when I spied a pair 
of silk shoes at a confessional: the 
feet of a penitent female.

"I want to see them leave," said Simone.

She sat down before me, not far from 
the confessional, and all I could do 
was caress her neck,
the line of her hair, or her shoulders 
with my cock. And that put her so much 
on edge that she told
me to tuck my penis away immediately or 
she would rub it until I came.

I had to sit down and merely look at 
Simone's nakedness through the soaked 
cloth, at its best in
the open air, when she wanted to fan 
her wet thighs and she uncrossed them 
and lifted her dress.

"You'll see," she said.

That was why I patiently waited for the 
key to the puzzle. After a rather long 
wait, a very beautiful
young brunette stepped out of the 
confessional, her hands folded, her 
face pale and enraptured:
with her head thrown back and her eyes 
white and vacant, she slowly eased 
across the room like
an opera ghost. There was something so 
truly unexpected about the whole thing 
that I
desperately squeezed my legs together 
to keep from laughing, when the door of 
the confessional
opened: someone else emerged, this time 
a blond priest, very young, very 
handsome, with a long
thin face and the pale eyes of a saint. 
His arms were crossed on his chest, and 
he remained on
the threshold of the booth, gazing at a 
fixed point on the ceiling as though a 
celestial apparition
were about to help him levitate.

The priest thus moved in the same 
direction as the woman, and he would 
probably have
vanished in turn without seeing 
anything if Simone, to my great 
surprise, had not brought him up
sharply. Something unbelievable had 
occurred to her: she greeted the 
visionary courteously and
said she wanted to confess.

The priest, still gliding in his 
ecstasy, indicated the confessional 
with a distant gesture and
reentered his tabernacle, softly 
closing the door without a word.

12. Simone's Confession and Sir 
Edmund's Mass

One can readily imagine my stupor at 
watching Simone kneel down by the 
cabinet of the
lugubrious confessor. While she 
confessed her sins, I waited, extremely 
anxious to see the
outcome of such an unexpected action. I 
assumed this sordid creature was going 
to burst from
his booth, pounce upon the impious 
girl, and flagellate her. I was even 
getting ready to knock the
dreadful phantom down and treat him to 
a few kicks; but nothing of the sort 
happened: the booth
remained closed, Simone spoke on and on 
through the tiny grilled window, and 
that was all.

I was exchanging sharply interrogative 
looks with Sir Edmund when things began 
to grow clear:
Simone was slowly scratching her thigh, 
moving her legs apart; keeping one knee 
on the prayer
stool, she shifted one foot to the 
floor, and she was exposing more and 
more of her legs over her
stockings while still murmuring her 
confession. At times she even seemed to 
be tossing off:

I softly drew up at the side to try and 
see what was happening: Simone really 
was masturbating,
the left part of her face was pressed 
against the grille near the priest's 
head, her limbs tensed,
her thighs splayed, her fingers 
rummaging deep in the fur; I was able 
to touch her, I bared her
cunt for an instant. At that moment, I 
distinctly heard her say:

"Father, I still have not confessed the 
worst sin of all."

A few seconds of silence.

"The worst sin of all is very simply 
that I'm tossing off while talking to 
you."

More seconds of whispering inside, and 
finally almost aloud:

"If you don't believe me, I can show 
you."

And indeed, Simone stood up and spread 
one thigh before the eye of the window 
while
masturbating with a quick, sure hand.

"All right, priest," cried Simone, 
banging away at the confessional, "what 
are you doing in your
shack there? Tossing off, too?"

But the confessional kept its peace.

"Well, then I'll open."

And Simone pulled out the door.

Inside, the visionary, standing there 
with lowered head, was mopping a 
sweat-bathed brow. The
girl groped for his cock under the 
cassock: he didn't turn a hair. She 
pulled up the filthy black skirt
so that the long cock stuck out, pink 
and hard: all he did was throw back his 
head with a grimace,
and a hiss escaped through his teeth, 
but he didn't interfere with Simone, 
who shoved the
bestiality into her mouth and took long 
sucks on it.

Sir Edmund and I were immobile in our 
stupor. For my part, I was spellbound 
with admiration, and
I didn't know what else to do, when the 
enigmatic Englishman resolutely strode 
to the
confessional and, after edging Simone 
aside as delicately as could be, 
dragged the larva out of
its hole by its wrists, and flung it 
brutally at our feet: the vile priest 
lay there like a cadaver, his
teeth to the ground, not uttering a 
cry. We promptly carried him to the 
vestry.

His fly was open, his cock dangling, 
his face livid and drenched with sweat, 
he didn't resist, but
breathed heavily: we put him in a large 
wooden armchair with architectural 
decorations.

"Senores," the wretch sniveled, "you 
must think I'm a hypocrite."

"No," replied Sir Edmund with a 
categorical intonation.

Simone asked him: "What's your name?"

"Don Aminado," he answered.

Simone slapped the sacerdotal pig, 
which gave him another hard-on. We 
stripped off all his
clothes, and Simone crouched down and 
pissed on them like a bitch. Then she 
wanked and
sucked the pig while I urinated in his 
nostrils. Finally, to top off this cold 
exaltation, I fucked
Simone in the ass while she violently 
sucked his cock.

Meanwhile, Sir Edmund, contemplating 
the scene with his characteristic poker 
face, carefully
inspected the room where we had found 
refuge. He glimpsed a tiny key hanging 
from a nail in the
woodwork.

"What is that key for?' he asked Don 
Aminado.

From the expression of dread on the 
priest's face, Sir Edmund realized it 
was the key to the
tabernacle.

The Englishman returned a few moments 
later, carrying a ciborium of twisted 
gold, decorated
with a quantity of angels as naked as 
cupids. The wretched Don Aminado gaped 
at this
receptacle of consecrated hosts on the 
floor, and his handsome moronic face, 
already contorted
because Simone was flagellating his 
cock with her teeth and tongue, was now 
fully gasping and
panting.

After barricading the door, Sir Edmund 
rummaged through the closets until he 
finally lit upon a
large chalice, whereupon he asked us to 
abandon the wretch for an instant.

"Look," he explained to Simone, "the 
eucharistic hosts in the ciborium, and 
here the chalice
where they put white wine."

"They smell like come," said Simone, 
sniffing the unleavened wafers.

"Precisely," continued Sir Edmund. "The 
hosts, as you see, are nothing other 
than Christ's sperm
in the form of small white biscuits. 
And as for the wine they put in the 
chalice, the ecclesiastics
say it is the blood of Christ, but they 
are obviously mistaken. If they really 
thought it was the
blood, they would use red wine, but 
since they employ only white wine, they 
are showing that at
the bottom of their hearts they are 
quite aware that this is urine."

The lucidity of this logic was so 
convincing that Simone and I required 
no further explanation.
She, armed with the chalice and I with 
the ciborium, the two of us marched 
over to Don Aminado,
who was still inert in his armchair, 
faintly agitated by a slight quiver 
through his body.

Simone began by slamming the base of 
the chalice against his skull, which 
jolted him and left him
utterly dazed. Then she resumed sucking 
him, which provoked his ignoble 
rattles. After bringing
his senses to a height of fury with Sir 
Edmund's help and mine, she gave him a 
hard shake.

"That's not all," she said in a voice 
that brooked no reply. "It's time to 
piss."

And she struck his face again with the 
chalice, but at the same time she 
stripped naked before
him and I finger-fucked her.

Sir Edmund's gaze, fixed on the stunned 
eyes of the young cleric, was so 
imperious that the thing
went off with barely any hitch; Don 
Aminado noisily poured his urine into 
the chalice, which
Simone held under this thick cock.

"And now, drink," commanded Sir Edmund.

The paralyzed wretch drank with a 
well-nigh filthy ecstasy at one long 
gluttonous draft. Again
Simone sucked and wanked him; he 
continued gurgling desperately and 
reveling in it. With a
demented gesture, he bashed the sacred 
chamber-pot against a wall. Four robust 
arms lifted him
up and, with open thighs, his body 
erect, and yelling like a pig being 
slaughtered, he spurted his
come on the hosts in the ciborium, 
which Simone held in front of him while 
masturbating him.

13. The Legs of the Fly

We dropped the swine and he crashed to 
the floor. Sir Edmund, Simone, and 
myself were coldly
animated by the same determination, 
together with an incredible excitement 
and levity. The priest
lay there with a limp cock, his teeth 
digging into the floor with rage and 
shame. Now that his balls
were drained, his abomination appeared 
to him in all its horror. He audibly 
sighed:

"Oh miserable sacrileges..."

And muttering other incomprehensible 
laments.

Sir Edmund nudged him with his foot; 
the monster leaped up and drew back, 
bellowing with such
ludicrous fury that we burst out 
laughing.

"Get on your feet," Sir Edmund ordered 
him, "you're going to fuck this girl."

"Wretches..." Don Aminado threatened in a 
choking voice . "Spanish police... 
prison... the
garrote..."

"But you are forgetting that is your 
sperm," observed Sir Edmund.

A ferocious grimace, a trembling like 
that of a cornered beast, and then: 
"The garrote for me too.
But you three... first."

"Poor fool," smirked Sir Edmund. 
"First! Do you think I am going to let 
you wait that long? First!"

The imbecile gaped dumbstruck at the 
Englishman: an extremely silly 
expression darted across
his handsome face. Something like an 
absurd joy began to open his mouth, he 
crossed his arms
over his naked chest and finally gazed 
at us with ecstatic eyes. "Martyrdom..." 
he uttered in a
voice that was suddenly feeble and yet 
tore out like a sob. "Martyrdom..." A 
bizarre hope of
purification had come to the wretch, 
illuminating his eyes.

"First I am going to tell you a story," 
Sir Edmund said to him sedately. "You 
know that men who
are hanged or garroted have such stiff 
cocks the instant their respiration is 
cut off, that they
ejaculate. You are going to have the 
pleasure of being martyred while 
fucking this girl."

And when the horrified priest rose to 
defend himself, the Englishman brutally 
knocked him down,
twisting his arm.

Next, Sir Edmund, slipping under his 
victim, pinioned his arms behind his 
back while I gagged
him and bound his legs with a belt. The 
Englishman, gripping his arms from 
behind in a
stranglehold, disabled the priest's 
legs in his own. Kneeling behind, I 
kept the man's head
immobile between my thighs.

"And now," said Sir Edmund to Simone, 
"mount this little padre."

Simone removed her dress and squatted 
on the belly of this singular martyr, 
her cunt next to his
flabby cock.

"Now," continued Sir Edmund, "squeeze 
his throat, the pipe just behind the 
Adam's apple: a
strong, gradual pressure."

Simone squeezed, a dreadful shudder ran 
through that mute, fully immobilized 
body, and the
cock stood on end. I took it into my 
hands and had no trouble fitting it 
into Simone's vulva, while
she continued to squeeze the throat.

The utterly intoxicated girl kept 
wrenching the big cock in and out with 
her buttocks, atop the body
whose muscles were cracking in our 
formidable strangleholds.

At last, she squeezed so resolutely 
that an even more violent thrill shot 
through her victim, and
she felt the come shooting inside her 
cunt. Now she let go, collapsing 
backwards in a tempest of
joy.

Simone lay on the floor, her belly up, 
her thigh still smeared by the dead 
man's sperm which had
trickled from her vulva. I stretched 
out at her side to rape and fuck her in 
turn, but all I could do
was squeeze her in my arms and kiss her 
mouth, because of a strange inward 
paralysis
ultimately caused by my love for the 
girl and the death of the unspeakable 
creature. I have never
been so content.

I didn't even stop Simone from pushing 
me aside and going to view her work. 
She straddled the
naked cadaver again, scrutinizing the 
purplish face with the keenest 
interest, she even sponged
the sweat off the forehead and 
obstinately waved away a fly buzzing in 
a sunbeam and endlessly
flitting back to alight on the face. 
All at once, Simone uttered a soft cry. 
Something bizarre and
quite baffling had happened: this time, 
the insect had perched on the corpse's 
eye and was
agitating its long nightmarish legs on 
the strange orb. The girl took her head 
in her hands and
shook it, trembling, then she seemed to 
plunge into an abyss of reflections.

Curiously, we weren't the least bit 
worried about what might happen. I 
suppose if anyone had
come along, Sir Edmund and I wouldn't 
have given him much time to be 
scandalized. But no
matter. Simone gradually emerged from 
her stupor and sought protection with 
Sir Edmund, who
stood motionless, his back to the wall; 
we could hear the fly flitting over the 
corpse.

"Sir Edmund," she said, rubbing her 
cheek gently on his shoulder, "I want 
you to do something."

"I shall do anything you like," he 
replied.

She made me come over to the corpse: 
she knelt down and completely opened 
the eye that the
fly had perched on.

"Do you see the eye?" she asked me.

"Well?"

"It's an egg," she concluded in all 
simplicity.

"All right," I urged her, extremely 
disturbed, "what are you getting at?"

"I want to play with this eye."

"What do you mean?"

"Listen, Sir Edmund," she finally let 
it out, "you must give me this at once, 
tear it out at once, I
want it!"

Sir Edmund was always poker-faced 
except when he turned purple. Nor did 
he bat an eyelash
now; but the blood did shoot to his 
face. He removed a pair of fine 
scissors from his wallet, knelt
down, then nimbly inserted the fingers 
of his left hand into the socket and 
drew out the eye, while
his right hand snipped the obstinate 
ligaments. Next, he presented the small 
whitish eyeball in a
hand reddened with blood.

Simone gazed at the absurdity and 
finally took it in her hand, completely 
distraught; yet she had
no qualms, and instantly amused herself 
by fondling the depth of her thighs and 
inserting this
apparently fluid object. The caress of 
the eye over the skin is so utterly, so 
extraordinarily gentle,
and the sensation is so bizarre that it 
has something of a rooster's horrible 
crowing.

Simone meanwhile amused herself by 
slipping the eye into the profound 
crevice of her ass, and
after lying down on her back and 
raising her legs and bottom, she tried 
to keep the eye there
simply by squeezing her buttocks 
together. But all at once, it spat out 
like a stone squeezed from
a cherry, and dropped on the thin belly 
of the corpse, an inch or so from the 
cock.

In the meantime, I had let Sir Edmund 
undress me, so that I could pounce 
stark naked on the
crouching body of the girl; my entire 
cock vanished at one lunge into the 
hairy crevice, and I
fucked her hard while Sir Edmund played 
with the eye, rolling it, in between 
the contortions of our
bodies, on the skin of our bellies and 
breasts. For an instant, the eye was 
trapped between our
navels.

"Put it up my ass, Sir Edmund," Simone 
shouted. And Sir Edmund delicately 
glided the eye
between her buttocks.

But finally, Simone left me, grabbed 
the beautiful eyeball from the hands of 
the tall Englishman,
and with a staid and regular pressure 
from her hands, she slid it into her 
slobbery flesh, in the
midst of the fur. And then she promptly 
drew me over, clutching my neck between 
her arms and
smashing her lips on mine so forcefully 
that I came without touching her and my 
come shot all
over her fur.

Now I stood up and, while Simone lay on 
her side, I drew her thighs apart, and 
found myself
facing something I imagine I had been 
waiting for in the same way that a 
guillotine waits for a
neck to slice. I even felt as if my 
eyes were bulging from my head, 
erectile with horror; in
Simone's hairy vagina, I saw the wan 
blue eye of Marcelle, gazing at me 
through tears of urine.
Streaks of come in the steaming hair 
helped give that dreamy vision a 
disastrous sadness. I held
the thighs open while Simone was 
convulsed by the urinary spasm, and the 
burning urine
streamed out from under the eye down to 
the thighs below...

Two hours later, Sir Edmund and I were 
sporting false black beards, and Simone 
was bedizened
in a huge, ridiculous black hat with 
yellow flowers and a long cloth dress 
like a noble girl from the
provinces. In this getup, we rented a 
car and left Seville. Huge valises 
allowed us to change our
personalities at every leg of the 
journey in order to outwit the police 
investigation. Sir Edmund
evinced a humorous ingenuity in these 
circumstances: thus we marched down the 
main street of
the small town of Ronda, he and I 
dressed as Spanish priests, wearing the 
small hairy felt hats
and priestly cloaks, and manfully 
puffing on big cigars; as for Simone, 
who was walking between
us in the costume of a Seville 
seminarist, she looked more angelic 
than ever. In this way, we kept
disappearing all through Andalusia, a 
country of yellow earth and yellow sky, 
to my eyes an
immense chamber pot flooded with 
sunlight, where each day, as a new 
character, I raped a
likewise transformed Simone, especially 
towards noon, on the ground and in the 
blazing sun,
under the reddish eyes of Sir Edmund.

On the fourth day, at Gibraltar, the 
Englishman purchased a yacht, and we 
set sail towards new
adventures with a crew of Negroes.

While composing this partly imaginary 
tale, I was struck by several 
coincidences, and since they
appeared indirectly to bring out the 
meaning of what I have written, I would 
like to describe them.

I began writing with no precise goal, 
animated chiefly by a desire to forget, 
at least for the time
being, the things I can be or do 
personally. Thus, at first, I thought 
that the character speaking in
the first person had no relation to me. 
But then one day I was looking through 
an American
magazine filled with photographs of 
European landscapes, and I chanced upon 
two astonishing
pictures: the first was a street in the 
practically unknown village from which 
my family comes; the
second, the nearby ruins of a medieval 
fortified castle on a crag in the 
mountain. I promptly
recalled an episode in my life, 
connected to those ruins. At the time, 
I was twenty-one; holidaying
in the village that summer, I decided 
one evening to go to the ruins that 
same night, and did so
immediately, accompanied by several 
perfectly chaste girls and, as a 
chaperone, my mother. I
was in love with one of the girls, and 
she shared my feelings, yet we had 
never spoken to one
another because she believed she had a 
religious calling, which she wanted to 
examine in all
liberty. After walking for some one and 
a half hours, we arrived at the foot of 
the castle around ten
or eleven on a rather gloomy night. We 
had started climbing the rocky mountain 
with its utterly
romantic wall, when a white and 
thoroughly luminous ghost leapt forth 
from a deep cavity in the
rocks and barred our way. It was so 
extraordinary that one girl and my 
mother fell back together,
and the others let out piercing 
shrieks. I myself felt a sudden terror, 
which stifled my voice, and so
it took me a few seconds before I could 
hurl some threats, which were 
unintelligible to the
phantom, even though I was certain from 
the very beginning that it was all a 
hoax. The phantom
did flee the moment he saw me striding 
towards him, and I didn't let him out 
of my sight until I
recognized my older brother, who had 
cycled up with another boy. Wearing a 
sheet, he had
succeeded in scaring us by popping out 
under the sudden ray of an acetylene 
lantern.

The day I found the photograph in the 
magazine, I had just finished the sheet 
episode in the
story, and I noticed that I kept seeing 
the sheet at the left, just as the 
sheeted ghost had
appeared at the left, and I realized 
there was a perfect coincidence of 
images tied to analogous
upheavals. Indeed, I have rarely been 
as dumbfounded as at the apparition of 
the false phantom.

I was very astonished at having 
unknowingly substituted a perfectly 
obscene image for a vision
apparently devoid of any sexual 
implication. Still, I would soon have 
cause for even greater
astonishment.

I had already thought out all the 
details of the scene in the Seville 
vestry, especially the incision in
the priest's socket and the plucking of 
his eye, when, realizing the kinship 
between the story and
my own life, I amused myself by 
introducing the description of a tragic 
bullfight that I had actually

witnessed. Oddly enough, I drew no 
connection between the two episodes 
until I did a precise
description of the injury inflicted on 
Manuel Granero (a real person) by the 
bull; but the moment I
reached this death scene, I was totally 
taken aback. The opening of the 
priest's eye was not, as I
had believed, a gratuitous invention. I 
was merely transferring, to a different 
person, an image
that had most likely led a very 
profound life. If I devised the 
business about snipping out the
priest's eye, it was because I had seen 
a bull's horn tear out a matador's eye. 
Thus, precisely the
two images that probably most upset me 
had sprung from the darkest corner of 
my memory-and
in a scarcely recognizable shape-as 
soon as I gave myself over to lewd 
dreams.

But no sooner did I realize this (I had 
just finished portraying the bullfight 
of May 1922) than I
visited a friend of mine, who is a 
doctor. I read the description to him, 
but it was not in the same
form as now. Never having seen the 
skinned balls of a bull, I assumed they 
were the same bright
red color as the erect cock of the 
animal, and that was how they were 
depicted in the first draft.
The entire Story of the Eye was woven 
in my mind out of two ancient and 
closely associated
obsessions, eggs and eyes, but 
nevertheless, I had previously regarded 
the balls of the bull as
independent of that cycle. Yet when I 
finished reading to him, my friend 
remarked that I had
absolutely no idea of what the glands I 
was writing about were really like, and 
he promptly read
aloud a detailed description in an 
anatomical textbook. I thus learned 
that human or animal balls
are egg-shaped and look the same as an 
eyeball.

This time, I ventured to explain such 
extraordinary relations by assuming a 
profound region of my
mind, where certain images coincide, 
the elementary ones, the completely 
obscene ones, i.e. the
most scandalous, precisely those on 
which the conscious floats 
indefinitely, unable to endure
them without an explosion or aberration.

However, upon locating this breaking 
point of the conscious or, if you will, 
the favorite place of
sexual deviation, certain quite 
different personal memories were 
quickly associated with some
harrowing images that had emerged 
during an obscene composition.

When I was born, my father was 
suffering from general paralysis, and 
he was already blind when
he conceived me; not long after my 
birth, his sinister disease confined 
him to an armchair.
However, the very contrary of most male 
babies, who are in love with their 
mothers, I was in love
with my father. Now the following was 
connected to his paralysis and 
blindness. He was unable to
go and urinate in the toilet like most 
people; instead, he did it into a small 
container at his
armchair, and since he had to urinate 
very often, he was unembarrassed about 
doing it in front of
me, under a blanket, which, since he 
was blind, he usually placed askew. But 
the weirdest thing
was certainly the way he looked while 
pissing. Since he could not see 
anything, his pupils very

frequently pointed up into space, 
shifting under the lids, and this 
happened particularly when he
pissed. Furthermore, he had huge, 
ever-gaping eyes that flanked an eagle 
nose, and those huge
eyes went almost entirely blank when he 
pissed, with a completely stupefying 
expression of
abandon and aberration in a world that 
he alone could see and that aroused his 
vaguely sardonic
and absent laugh (I would have liked to 
recall everything here at once, for 
instance the erratic
nature of a blind man's isolated 
laughter, and so forth). In any case, 
the image of those white
eyes from that time was directly 
linked, for me, to the image of eggs, 
and that explains the almost
regular appearance of urine every time 
eyes or eggs occur in the story.

After perceiving this kinship between 
distinct elements, I was led to 
discover a further, no less
essential kinship between the general 
nature of my story and a particular 
fact.

I was about fourteen when my affection 
for my father turned into a deep and 
unconscious hatred.
I began vaguely enjoying his constant 
shrieks at the lightning pains caused 
by the tabes, which
are considered among the worst pain 
known to man. Furthermore, the filthy, 
smelly state to which
his total disablement often reduced him 
(for instance, he sometimes left shit 
on his trousers) was
not nearly so disagreeable to me as I 
thought. Then again, in all things, I 
adopted the attitudes
and opinions most radically opposed to 
those of that supremely nauseating 
creature.

One night, we were awakened, my mother 
and I, by vehement words that the 
syphilitic was
literally howling in his room: he had 
suddenly gone mad. I went for the 
doctor, who came
immediately. My father kept endlessly 
and eloquently imagining the most 
outrageous and
generally the happiest events. The 
doctor had withdrawn to the next room 
with my mother and I
had remained with the blind lunatic, 
when he shrieked in a stentorian voice: 
"Doctor, let me know
when you're done fucking my wife!" For 
me, that utterance, which in a split 
second annihilated the
demoralizing effects of a strict 
upbringing, left me with something like 
a steady obligation,
unconscious and unwilled: the necessity 
of finding an equivalent to that 
sentence in any situation
I happen to be in; and this largely 
explains Story of the Eye.

To complete this survey of the high 
summits of my personal obscenity, I 
must add a final
connection I made in regard to 
Marcelle. It was one of the most 
disconcerting, and I did not arrive
at it until the very end.

It is impossible for me to say 
positively that Marcelle is basically 
identical with my mother. Such a
statement would actually be, if not 
false, then at least exaggerated. Thus 
Marcelle is also a
fourteen-year-old girl who once sat 
opposite me for a quarter of an hour at 
the Café des Deux

Magots in Paris. Nonetheless, I still 
want to tell about some memories that 
ultimately fastened a
few episodes to unmistakable facts.

Soon after my father's attack of 
lunacy, my mother, at the end of a vile 
scene to which her mother
subjected her in front of me, suddenly 
lost her mind too. She spent several 
months in a crisis of
manic-depressive insanity (melancholy). 
The absurd ideas of damnation and 
catastrophe that
seized control of her irritated me even 
more because I was forced to look after 
her continually.
She was in such a bad state that one 
night I removed some candlesticks with 
marble bases from
my room; I was afraid she might kill me 
while I slept. On the other hand, 
whenever I lost patience,
I went so far as to strike her, 
violently twisting her wrists to try 
and bring her to her senses.

One day, my mother disappeared while 
our backs were turned; we hunted her 
for a long time and
finally found her hanged in the attic. 
However, they managed to revive her.

A short time later, she disappeared 
again, this time at night; I myself 
went looking for her,
endlessly, along a creek, wherever she 
might have tried to drown herself. 
Running without
stopping, through the darkness, across 
swamps, I at last found myself face to 
face with her: she
was drenched up to her belt, the skirt 
was pissing the creek water, but she 
had come out on her
own, and the icy, wintery water was not 
very deep anyway.

I never linger over such memories, for 
they have long since lost any emotional 
significance for
me. There was no way I could restore 
them to life except by transforming 
them and making them
unrecognizable, at first glance, to my 
eyes, solely because during that 
deformation they acquired
the lewdest of meanings.

W.C.

(Preface to Story of the Eye from 
another text by Bataille called "Le 
Petit" [1943])

A year before Story of the Eye, I had 
written a book entitled W.C.: a small 
book, a rather crazy
piece of writing. W.C. was as 
lugubrious as Story of the Eye was 
juvenile. The manuscript of
W.C. was burnt, but that was no loss, 
considering my present sadness: it was 
a shriek of horror
(horror at myself, not for my 
debauchery, but for the philosopher's 
head in which since then...
how sad it is!). On the other hand, I 
am as happy as ever with the 
fulminating joy of The Eye:
nothing can wipe it away. Such joy, 
bordering on naive folly, will forever 
remain beyond terror, for
terror reveals its meaning.

A drawing for W.C. showed an eye: the 
scaffold's eye. Solitary, solar, 
bristling with lashes, it
gazed from the lunette of a guillotine. 
The drawing was named Eternal 
Recurrence, and its
horrible machine was the cross-beam, 
gymnastic gallows, portico. Coming from 
the horizon, the
road to eternity passed through it. A 
parodic verse, heard in a sketch at the 
Concert Mayol,
supplied the caption:

God, how the corpse's blood is sad in 
the depth of sound.

Story of the Eye has another 
reminiscence of W.C., which appears on 
the title page, placing all
that follows under the worst of signs. 
The name Lord Auch [pronounced osh] 
refers to a habit of a
friend of mine; when vexed, instead of 
saying "aux chiottes!" (to the 
shithouse), he would shorten
it to "aux ch'." Lord is English for 
God (in the Scriptures): Lord Auch is 
God relieving himself. The
story is too lively to dwell upon; 
every creature transfigured by such a 
place: God sinking into it
rejuvenates the heavens.

To be God, naked, solar, in the rainy 
night, on a field: red, divinely, 
manuring with the majesty of
a tempest, the face grimacing, torn 
apart, being IMPOSSIBLE in tears: who 
knew, before me,
what majesty is?

The "eye of the conscience" and the 
"woods of justice" incarnate eternal 
recurrence, and is there
any more desperate image for remorse?

I gave the author of W.C. the pseudonym 
of Troppmann.

I masturbated naked, at night, by my 
mother's corpse. (A few people, reading 
"Coincidences,"
wondered whether it did not have the 
fictional character of the tale itself. 
But, like this preface,
"Coincidences" has a literal exactness: 
many people in the village of R. could 
confirm the
material; moreover, some of my friends 
did read W.C.)

What upset me more was: seeing my 
father shit a great number of times. He 
would get out of his
blind paralytic's bed (my father being 
both blind and paralytic at once). It 
was very hard for him to
get out of bed (I would help him) and 
settle on a chamber-pot, in his 
nightshirt and, usually, a
cotton nightcap (he had a pointed gray 
beard, ill-kempt, a large eagle-nose, 
and immense hollow
eyes staring into space). At times, the 
"lightning-sharp pains" would make him 
howl like a beast,
sticking out his bent leg, which he 
futilely hugged in his arms.

My father having conceived me when 
blind (absolutely blind), I cannot tear 
out my eyes like
Oedipus.

Like Oedipus, I solved the riddle: no 
one divined it more deeply than I.

On November 6, I915, in a bombarded 
town, a few miles from the German 
lines, my father died in
abandonment.

My mother and I had abandoned him 
during the German advance in August 
1914.

We had left him with the housekeeper.

The Germans occupied the town, then 
evacuated it. We could now return: my 
mother, unable to
bear the thought of it, went mad. Late 
that year, my mother recovered: she 
refused to let me go
home to N. We received occasional 
letters from my father, he just barely 
ranted and raved. When
we learned he was dying, my mother 
agreed to go with me. He died a few 
days before our arrival,
asking for his children: we found a 
sealed coffin in the bedroom.

When my father went mad (a year before 
the war) after a hallucinating night, 
my mother sent me
to the post office to dispatch a 
telegram. I remember being struck with 
a horrible pride en route.
Misery overwhelmed me, internal irony 
replied: "So much horror makes you 
predestined": a few
months earlier, one fine morning in 
December, I had informed my parents, 
who were beside
themselves, that I would never set foot 
in school again. No amount of anger 
could change my
mind: I lived alone, going out rarely, 
by way of the fields, avoiding the 
center, where I might have
run into friends.

My father, an unreligious man, died 
refusing to see the priest. During 
puberty, I was unreligious
myself (my mother indifferent). But I 
went to a priest in August 1914; and 
until 1920, rarely did I
let a week go by without confessing my 
sins! In 1920, I changed again, I 
stopped believing in
anything but my future chances. My 
piety was merely an attempt at evasion: 
I wanted to escape
my destiny at any price, I was 
abandoning my father. Today, I know I 
am "blind," immeasurable, I
am man "abandoned" on the globe like my 
father at N. No one on earth or in 
heaven cared about
my father's dying terror. Still, I 
believe he faced up to it, as always. 
What a "horrible pride," at
moments, in father's blind smile!

After fifteen years of more and more 
serious debauchery, Simone ends up in a 
torture camp. But
by mistake; descriptions of torture, 
tears, imbecility of unhappiness, 
Simone at the threshold of a
conversion, exhorted by a cadaverous 
woman, one more in the series of 
devotees of the Church
of Seville. She is now thirty-five. 
Beautiful when entering the camp, but 
old age is gradually taking
over, irremediable. Beautiful scene 
with a female torturer and the devotee; 
the devotee and
Simone are beaten to death, Simone 
escapes temptation. She dies as though 
making love, but in
the purity (chaste) and the imbecility 
of death: fever and agony transfigure 
her. The torturer
strikes her, she is indifferent to the 
blows, indifferent to the words of the 
devotee, lost in the labor
of agony. It is by no means an erotic 
joy, it is far more than that. But with 
no result. Nor is it
masochistic, and, profoundly, this 
exaltation is beyond any imagining; it 
surpasses everything.
However, its basis is solitude and 
absence.
