	Hi Chandler,
            
Finding this group is a real windfall for me.
I never thought I'd get the chance to talk
about my illness with others. In the interest
of opening up communications, I'd like to
share a bit about myself.
                
I suffer from a twisted sexuality. Reviled by
all. Delivered to me from my father.
                
I can't help but be attracted to children.
                
I've never acted on these desires, and I
never will. Still I doubt my condition will
ever go away.
                
I've considered chemical castration, but I
can't commit to it. So now, with the help of
Virtue Community, I'll strive to lead a
normal life.
                
	Thank you,
    Murphy Goodwin
