Introduction
A Political Use of

Psychoanalysis

This paper intends to use 
psychoanalysis to discover where and
how the fascination of film is 
reinforced by pre-existing patterns
of fascination already at work within 
the individual subject and the
social formations that have moulded 
him. It takes as starting point
the way film reflects, reveals and even 
plays on the straight, socially
established interpretation of sexual 
difference which controls
images, erotic ways of looking and 
spectacle. It is helpful to understand 
what the cinema has been, how its magic 
has worked in the
past, while attempting a theory and a 
practice which will challenge
this cinema of the past. Psychoanalytic 
theory is thus appropriated here as a 
political weapon, demonstrating the way 
the unconscious of patriarchal society 
has structured film form.
The paradox of phallocentrism in all 
its manifestations is that it
depends on the image of the castrated 
woman to give order and
meaning to its world. An idea of woman 
stands as lynch pin to the
system: it is her lack that produces 
the phallus as a symbolic
presence, it is her desire to make good 
the lack that the phallus
signifies. Recent wrting in Screen 
about psychoanalysis and the
cinema has not sufficiently brought out 
the importance of the
representation of the female form in a 
symbolic order in which, in
the last resort, it speaks castration 
and nothing else. To summarise
briefly: the function of woman in 
forming the patriarchal unconscious is 
two-fold, she first symbolises the 
castration threat by her
real absence of a penis and second 
thereby raises her child into the
symbolic. Once this has been achieved, 
her meaning in the process
is at an end, it does not last into the 
world of law and language
except as a memory which oscillates 
between memory of maternal

 

Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema

B. Destruction of Pleasure as a Radical 
Weapon
As an advanced representation system, 
the cinema poses questions
of the ways the unconscious (formed by 
the dominant order) structures ways of 
seeing and pleasure in looking. Cinema 
has changed
over the last few decades. It is no 
longer the monolithic system
based on large capital investment 
exemplified at its best by Hollywood in 
the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. 
Technological advances
(16mm, etc) have changed the economic 
conditions of cinematic
production, which can now be artisanal 
as well as capitalist. Thus
it has been possible for an alternative 
cinema to develop. However
self-conscious and ironic Hollywood 
managed to be, it always
restricted itself to a formal 
mise-en-scene reflecting the dominant
ideological concept of the cinema. The 
alternative cinema provides
a space for a cinema to be born which 
is radical in both a political

plenitude and memory of lack. Both are 
posited on nature (or on 7
anatomy in Freud's famoas phrase). 
Woman's desire is subjected
to her image as bearer of the bleeding 
wound, she can exist only
in relation to castration and cannot 
transcend it. She turns her
child into the signifier of her own 
desire to possess a penis (the
condition, she imagines, of entry into 
the symbolic). Either she
must gracefully give way to the word, 
the Name of the Father and
the Law, or else struggle to keep her 
child down with her in the
half-light of the imaginary. Woman then 
stands in patriarchal
culture as signifier for the male 
other, bound by a symbolic order
in which man can live out his 
phantasies and obsessions through
linguistic command by imposing them on 
the silent image of
woman still tied to her place as bearer 
of meaning, not maker of
meaning.
There is an obvious interest in this 
analysis for feminists, a
beauty in its exact rendering of the 
frustration experienced under
the phallocentric order. It gets us 
nearer to the roots of our
oppression, it brings an articulation 
of the problem closer, it faces,
us with the ultimate challenge: how to 
fight the unconscious
structured like a language (formed 
critically at the moment of
arrival of language) while still caught 
within the language of the
patriarchy. There is no way in which we 
can produce an alternative
out of the blue, but we can begin to 
make a break by examining
patriarchy with the tools it provides, 
of which psychoanalysis is
not the only but an important one. We 
are still separated by a
great gap from important issues for the 
female unconscious which
are scarcely relevant to phallocentric 
theory: the sexing of the
female infant and her relationship to 
the symbolic the sexually
mature woman as non-mother, maternity 
outside the signification
of the phallus, the vagina. . . . But, 
at this point, psychoanalytic
theory as it now stands can at least 
advance our understanding of
the status quo, of the patriarchal 
order in which we are caught.

II Pleasure in Looking/Fascination with 
the Human Form
A. The cinema offers a number of 
possible pleasures. One is
scopophilia. There are circumstances in 
which looking itself is a
source of pleasure, just as, in the 
reverse formation, there is
pleasure in being looked at. 
Originally, in his Three Essays on
Sexuality, Freud isolated scopophilia 
as one of the component
instincts of sexuality which exist as 
drives quite independently of
the erotogenic zones. At this point he 
associated scopophilia with
taking other people as objects, 
subjecting them to a controlling
and curious gaze. His particular 
examples centie around the
voyeuristic activities of children, 
their desire to see and make sure
of the private and the forbidden 
(curiosity about other people's
genital and bodily functions, about the 
presence or absence of the

 

and an aesthetic sense and challenges 
ti e basic assumptions of the
mainstream film. This is not to reject 
the latter moralistically, but
to highlight the ways in which its 
formal preoccupations reflect
the psychical obsessions of the society 
which produced it, and,
further, to stress that the alternative 
cinema must start specifically
by reacting against these obsessions 
and assumptions. A politically
and aesthetically avant-garde cinema is 
now possible, but it can
still only exist as a counterpoint.
The magic of the Hollywood style at its 
best (and of all the
cinema which fell within its sphere of 
influence) arose, not exclusively, but 
in one important aspect, from its 
skilled and satisfying manipulation of 
visual pleasure. Unchallenged, 
mainstream
film coded the erotic into the language 
of the dominant patriarchal
order. In the highly developed 
Hollywood cinema it was only
through these codes that the alienated 
subject, torn in his imaginary memory 
by a sense of loss, by the terror of 
potential lack in
phantasy, came near to finding a 
glimpse of satisfaction: through
its formal beauty and its play on his 
own formative obsessions.
This article will discuss the 
interweaving of that erotic pleasure
in film, its meaning, and in particular 
the central place of the
image of woman. It is said that 
analysing pleasure, or beauty,
destroys it. That is the intention of 
this article. The satisfaction
and reinforcement of the ego that 
represent the high point of film
history hitherto must be attacked. Not 
in favour of a reconstructed
new pleasure, which cannot exist in the 
abstract, nor of intellectualised 
unpleasure, but to make way for a total 
negation of
the ease and plenitude of the narrative 
fiction film. The alternative
is the thrill that comes from leaving 
the past behind without
rejecting it, transcending outworn or 
oppressive forms, or daring
to break with normal pleasurable 
expectations in order to conceive
a new language of desire.

B. The rinema satisfies a primordial 
wish for pleasurable looking,
but it also goes further, developing 
scopophilia in its narcissistic
aspect. The conventions of mainstream 
film focus attention on the
human form. Scale, space, stories are 
all anthropomorphic. Here,
curiosity and the wish to look 
intermingle with a fascination with
likeness and recognition: the human 
face, the human body, the
relationship between the human form and 
its surroundings, the
visible presence of the person in the 
world. Jacques Lacan has
described how the moment when a child 
lecognises its own image
in the mirror is crucial for the 
constitution of the ego. Several
aspects of this analysis are relevant 
here. The mirror phase occurs
at a time when the child's physical 
ambitions outstrip his motor
capacity, with the result that his 
recognition of himself is joyous
in that he imagines his mirror image to 
be more complete, more
perfect than he experiences his own 
body. Recognition is thus
overlaid with mis-recognition: the 
image recognised is conceived

 

penis and, retrospectively, about the 
primal scene). In this analysis
scopophilia is essentially active. 
(Later, in Instincts and their
Vicissitudes, Freud developed his 
theory of scopophilia further,
attaching it initially to pre-genital 
auto-eroticism, after which the
pleasure of the look is transferred to 
others by analogy. There is
a close working here of the 
relationship between the active instinct
and its further development in a 
narcissistic form.) Although the
instinct is modified by other factors, 
in particular the constitution
of the ego, it continues to exist as 
the erotic basis for pleasure
in looking at another person as object. 
At the extreme, it can
become fixated into a perversion, 
producing obsessive voyeurs and
Peeping Toms, whose only sexual 
satisfaction can come from
watching, in an active controlling 
sense, an objectified other.
At first glance, the cinema would seem 
to be remote from the
undercover world of the surreptitious 
observation of an unknowing
and unwilling victim. What is seen of 
the screen is so manifestly
shown. But the mass of mainstream film, 
and the conventions
within which it has consciously 
evolved, portray a hermetically
sealed world which unwinds magically, 
indifferent to the presence
of the audience, producing for them a 
sense of separation and
playing on their voyeuristic phantasy. 
Moreover, the extreme contrast between 
the darkness in the auditorium (which 
also isolates
the spectators from one another) and 
the brilliance of the shifting
patterns of light and shade on the 
screen helps to promote the
illusion of voyeuristic separation. 
Although the film is really being
shown, is there to be seen, conditions 
of screening and narrative
conventions give the spectator an 
illusion of looking in on a private
world. Among other things, the position 
of the spectators in the
rinema is blatantly one of repression 
of their exhibitionism and
projection of the repressed desire on 
to the performer.

io

C. Sections II. A and B have set out 
two contradictory aspects of
the pleasurable structures of looking 
in the conventional cinematic
situation. The first, scopophilic, 
arises from pleasure in using
another person as an object of sexual 
stimulation through sight.
The second, developed through 
narcissism and the constitution of
the ego, comes from identification with 
the image seen. Thus, in
film terms, one implies a separation of 
the erotic identity of the
subject from the object on the screen 
(active scopophilia), the
other demands identification of the ego 
with the object on the
screen through the spectator's 
fascination with and recognition of
his like. The first is a function of 
the sexual instincts, the second
of ego libido. This dichotomy was 
crucial for Freud. Although he
saw the two as interacting and 
overlaying each other, the tension
between instinctual drives and 
self-preservation continues to be
a dramatic polarisation in terms of 
pleasure. Both are formative
structures, mechanisms not meaning. In 
themselves they have no
signification, they have to be attached 
to an idealisation. Both
pursue aims in indifference to 
perceptual reality, creating the
imagised, eroticised concept of the 
world that forms the perception
of the subject and makes a mockery of 
empirical objectivity.

 

as the reflected body of the self, but 
its misrecognition as superior
projects this body outside itself as an 
ideal ego, the alienated
subject, which, re-introjected as an 
ego ideal, gives rise to the
future generation of identification 
with others. This mirror-moment
predates language for the child.
Important for this article is the fact 
that it is an image that
constitutes the matrix of the 
imaginary, of 
recognition/misrecognition and 
identification, and hence of the first 
articulation
of the ' I *, of subjectivity. This is 
a moment when an older
fascination with looking (at the 
mother's face, for an obvious
example) collides with the initial 
inklings of self-awareness. Hence
it is the birth of the long love 
affair/despair between image and
self-image which has found such 
intensity of expression in film
and such joyous recognition in the 
cinema audience. Quite apart
from the extraneous similarities 
between screen and mirror (the
framing of the human form in its 
surroundings, for instance), the
cinema has structures of fascination 
strong enough to allow temporary loss 
of ego while simultaneously reinforcing 
the ego. The
sense of forgetting the world as the 
ego has subsequently come to
perceive it (I forgot who I am and 
where I was) is nostalgically
reminiscent of that pre-subjective 
moment of image recognition.
At the same time the cinema has 
distinguished itself in the production 
of ego ideals as expressed in 
particular in the star system,
the stars centring both screen presence 
and screen story as they
act out a complex process of likeness 
and difference (the glamorous
impersonates the ordinary).

Ill Woman as Image, Man as Bearer of 
the Look
A. In a world ordered by sexual 
imbalance, pleasure in looking
has been split between active/male and 
passive/female. The determining male 
gaze projects its phantasy on to the 
female figure
which is styled accordingly. In their 
traditional exhibitionist role
women are simultaneously looked at and 
displayed, with their
appearance coded for strong visual and 
erotic impact so that they
can be said to connote 
to-be-looked-at-ness. Woman displayed as
sexual object is the leit-motif of 
erotic spectacle: from pin-ups to
strip-tease, from Ziegfeld to Busby 
Berkeley, she holds the look,
plays to and signifies male desire. 
Mainstream film neatly combined
spectacle and narrative. (Note, 
however, how in the musical 
songand-dance numbers break the flow of 
the diegesis.) The presence of
woman is an indispensable element of 
spectacle in normal narrative film, yet 
her visual presence tends to work 
against the development of a story 
line, to freeze the flow of action in 
moments of
erotic contemplation. This alien 
presence then has to be integrated
into cohesion with the narrative. As 
Budd Boetticher has put it:
' What counts is what the heroine 
provokes, or rather what she
represents. She is the one, or rather 
the love or fear she inspires
in the hero, or else the concern he 
feels for her, who makes him
act the way he does. In herself the 
woman has not the slightest
importance.'
(A recent tendency in narrative film 
has been to dispense with this
problem altogether; hence the 
development of what Molly Haskell
has called the 'buddy movie', in which 
the active homosexual
eroticism of the central male figures 
can carry the story without
distraction.) Traditionally, the woman 
displayed has functioned on
two levels: as erotic object for the 
characters within the screen
story, and as erotic object for the 
spectator within the auditorium,
with a shifting tension between the 
looks on either side of the

 

During its history, the cinema seems to 
have evolved a par- 11
ticular illusion of reality in which 
this contradiction between libido
and ego has found a beautifully 
complementary phantasy world.
In reality the phantasy world of the 
screen is subject to the law
which produces it.. Sexual instincts 
and identification processes
have a meaning within the symbolic 
order which articulates desire.
Desire, born with language, allows the 
possibility of transcending
the instinctual and the imaginary, but 
its point of reference continually 
returns to the traumatic moment of its 
birth: the castration complex. Hence 
the look, pleasurable in form, can be 
threatening in content, and it is woman 
as representation/image that
crystallises this paradox.

B. An active/passive heterosexual 
division of labour has similarly
controlled narrative structure. 
According to the principles of the
ruling ideology and the psychical 
structures that back it up, the
male figure cannot bear the burden of 
sexual objectification. Man
is reluctant to gaze at his 
exhibitionist like. Hence the split
between spectacle and narrative 
supports the man's role as the
active one of forwarding the story, 
making things happen. The
man controls the film phantasy and also 
emerges as the representative of power 
in a further sense: as the bearer of 
the look of the
spectator, transferring it behind the 
screen to neutralise the extradiegetic 
tendencies represented by woman as 
spectacle. This is
made possible through the processes set 
in motion by structuring
the film around a main controlling 
figure with whom the spectator
can identify. As the spectator 
identifies with the main male1 
protagonist, he projects his look on to 
that of his like, his screen
surrogate, so that the power of the 
male protagonist as he controls
events coincides with the active power 
of the erotic look, both
giving a satisfying sense of 
omnipotence. A male movie star's
glamorous characteristics are thus not 
those of the erotic object
of the gaze, but those of the more 
perfect, more complete, more
powerful ideal ego conceived in the 
original moment of recognition
in front of the mirror. The character 
in the story can make things
happen and control events better than 
the subject/spectator, just
as the image in the mirror was more in 
control of motor coordination. In 
contrast to woman as icon, the active 
male figure
(the ego ideal of the identification 
process) demands a three1. There are 
films with a woman as main protagonist, 
of course. To
analyse this phenomenon seriously here 
would take me too far afield.
Pam Cook and Claire Johnston's study of 
The Revolt of Mamie
Stover in Phil Hardy, ed: Raoul Walsh, 
Edinburgh 1974, shows in a
striking case how the strength of this 
female protagonist is more
apparent than real.

 

12 screen. For instance, the device of 
the show-girl allows the two
looks to be unified technically without 
any apparent break in the
diegesis. A woman performs within the 
narrative, the gaze of the
spectator and that of the male 
characters in the film are neatly
combined without breaking narrative 
verisimilitude. For a moment
the sexual impact of the performing 
woman takes the film into a
no-man's-land outside its own time and 
space. Thus Marilyn
Monroe's first appearance in The River 
of No Return and Lauren
Bacall's songs in To Have or Have Not. 
Similarly, conventional
close-ups of legs (Dietrich, for 
instance) or a face (Garbo) integrate
into the narrative a different mode of 
eroticism. One part of a
fragmented body destroys the 
Renaissance space, the illusion of
depth demanded by the narrative, it 
gives flatness, the quality of
a cut-out or icon rather than 
verisimilitude to the screen.


dimensional space corresponding to that
of the mirror-recognition
in which the alienated subject 
internalised his own representation
of this imaginary existence. He is a 
figure in a landscape. Here the
function of film is to reproduce as 
accurately as possible the socalled 
natural conditions of human perception. 
Camera technology
(as exemplified by deep focus in 
particular) and camera movements 
(determined by the action of the 
protagonist), combined with
invisible editing (demanded by realism) 
all tend to blur the limits
of screen space. The male protagonist 
is free to command the stage,
a stage of spatial illusion in which he 
articulates the look and
creates the action.
 

C.i Sections III. A and B have set out 
a tension between a mode
of representation of woman in film and 
conventions surrounding the
diegesis. Each is associated with a 
look: that of the spectator in
direct scopophilic contact with the 
female form displayed for his
enjoyment (connoting male phantasy) and 
that of the spectator
fascinated with the image of his like 
set in an illusion of natural
space, and through him gaining control 
and possession of the
woman within the diegesis. (This 
tension and the shift from one
pole to the other can structure a 
single text. Thus both in Only
Angels Have Wings and in To Have and 
Have Not, the film opens
with the woman as object of the 
combined gaze of spectator and
all the male protagonists in the film. 
She is isolated, glamorous,
on display, sexualised. But as the 
narrative progresses she falls in
love with the main male protagonist and 
becomes his property,
losing her outward glamorous 
characteristics, her generalised
sexuality, her show-girl connotations; 
her eroticism is subjected to
the male star alone. By means of 
identification with him, through
participation in his power, the 
spectator can indirectly possess
her too.)
But in psychoanalytic terms, the female 
figure poses a deeper
problem. She also connotes something 
that the look continually
circles around but disavows: her lack 
of a penis, implying a threat
of castration and hence unpleasure. 
Ultimately, the meaning of
woman is sexual difference, the absence 
of the penis as visually
ascertainable, the material evidence on 
which is based the castration complex 
essential for the organisation of 
entrance to the symbolic order and the 
law of the father. Thus the woman as 
icon,
displayed for the gaze and enjoyment of 
men, the active controllers
of the look, always threatens to evoke 
the anxiety it originally
signified. The male unconscious has two 
avenues of escape from
this castration anxiety: preoccupation 
with the re-enactment of
the original trauma (investigating the 
woman, demystifying her
mystery), counterbalanced by the 
devaluation, punishment or saving
of the guilty object (an avenue 
typified by the concerns of the film
noir); or else complete disavowal of 
castration by the substitution

C.2 It is well known that Stemberg once 
said he would welcome
his films being projected upside down 
so that story and character
involvement would not interfere with 
the spectator's undiluted
appreciation of the screen image. This 
statement is revealing but
ingenuous. Ingenuous in that his films 
do demand that the figure
of the woman (Dietrich, in the cycle of 
films with her, as the
ultimate example) should be 
identifiable. But revealing in that it
emphasises the fact that for him the 
pictorial space enclosed by
the frame is paramount rather than 
narrative or identification
processes. While Hitchcock goes into 
the investigative side of
voyeurism, Stemberg produces the 
ultimate fetish, taking it to the
point where the powerful look of the 
male protagonist (characteristic of 
traditional narrative film) is broken 
in favour of the image
in direct erotic rapport with the 
spectator. The beauty of the
woman as object and the screen space 
coalesce; she is no longer
the bearer of guilt but a perfect 
product, whose body, stylised and
fragmented by close-ups, is the content 
of the film and the direct
recipient of the spectator's look. 
Stemberg plays down the illusion
of screen depth; his screen tends to be 
one-dimensional, as light
and shade, lace, steam, foliage, net. 
streamers, etc, reduce the
visual field. There is little or no 
mediation of the look through
the eyes of the main male protagonist. 
On the contrary, shadowy
presences like La Bessiere in Morocco 
act as surrogates for the
director, detached as they are from 
audience identification. Despite
Sternberg's insistence that his stories 
are irrelevant, it is significant
that they are concerned with situation, 
not suspense, and cyclical

 

14 of a fetish object or turning the 
represented figure itself into a
fetish so that it becomes reassuring 
rather than dangerous (hence
over-valuation, the cult of the female 
star). This second avenue,
fetishistic scopophilia, builds up the 
physical beauty of the object,
transforming it into something 
satisfying in itself. The first avenue,
voyeurism, on the contrary, has 
associations with sadism: pleasure
lies in ascertaining guilt (immediately 
associated with castration),
asserting control and subjecting the 
guilty person through punishment or 
forgiveness. This sadistic side fits in 
well with narrative.
Sadism demands a story, depends on 
making something happen,
forcing a change in another person, a 
battle of will and strength,
victory/defeat, all occuring in a 
linear time with a beginning and
an end. Fetishistic scopophilia, on the 
other hand, can exist outside linear 
time as the erotic instinct is focussed 
on the look alone.
These contradictions and ambiguities 
can be illustrated more simply
by using works by Hitchcock and 
Stemberg, both of whom take
the look almost as the content or 
subject matter of many of their
films. Hitchcock is the more complex, 
as he uses both mechanisms.
Sternberg's work, on the other hand, 
provides many pure examples
of fetishistic scopophilia.

 

rather thai, linear time, while plot 
complications revolve around 15
misunderstanding rather than conflict. 
The most important absence
is that of the controlling male gaze 
within the screen scene. The
high point of emotional drama in the 
most typical Dietrich films,
her supreme moments of erotic meaning, 
take place in the absence
of the man she loves in the fiction. 
There are other witnesses, other
spectators watching her on the screen, 
their gaze is one with, not
standing in for, that of the audience. 
At the end of Morocco, Tom
Brown has already disappeared into the 
desert when Amy Jolly
kicks off her gold sandals and walks 
after him. At the end of
Dishonoured. Kranau is indifferent to 
the fate of Magda. In both
cases, the erotic impact, sanctified by 
death, is displayed as a
spectacle for the audience. The male 
hero misunderstands and,
above all, does not see.
In Hitchcock, by contrast, the male 
hero does see precisely what
the audience sees. However, in the 
films I shall discuss here, he
takes fascination with an image through 
scopophilic eroticism as
the subject of the film. Moreover, in 
these cases the hero portrays
the contradictions and tensions 
experienced by the spectator. In
Vertigo in particular, but also in 
Mamie and Rear Window, the
look is central to the plot, 
oscillating between voyeurism and
fetishistic fascination. As a twist, a 
further manipulation of the
normal viewing process which in some 
sense reveals it, Hitchcock
uses the process of identification 
normally associated with ideological 
correctness and the recognition of 
established morality and
shows up its perverted side. Hitchcock 
has never concealed his
interest in voyeurism, cinematic and 
non-cinematic. His heroes
are exemplary of the symbolic order and 
the law - a policeman
(Vertigo), a dominant male possessing 
money and power (Mamie) —
but their erotic drives lead them into 
compromised situations. The
power to subject another person to the 
will sadistically or to the
gaze voyeuristically is turned on to 
the woman as the object of
both. Power is backed by a certainty of 
legal right and the established guilt 
of the woman (evoking castration, 
psychoanalytically
speaking). True perversion is barely 
concealed under a shallow
mask of ideological correctness - the 
man is on the right side of
the law, the woman on the wrong. 
Hitchcock's skilful use of 
identification processes and liberal 
use of subjective camera from the
point of view of the male protagonist 
draw the spectators deeply
into his position, making them share 
his uneasy gaze. The audience
is absorbed into a voyeuristic 
situation within the screen scene
and diegesis which parodies his own in 
the cinema. In his analysis
of Rear Window, Douchet takes the film 
as a metaphor for the
cinema. Jeffries is the audience, the 
events in the apartment block
opposite correspond to the screen. As 
he watches, an erotic dimension is 
added to his look, a central image to 
the drama. His girlfriend Lisa had been 
of little sexual interest to him, more 
or less
a drag, so long as she remained on the 
spectator side. When she

 

16 crosses the barrier between his room 
and the block opposite, their
relationship is re-born erotically. He 
does not merely watch her
through his lens, as a distant 
meaningful image, he also sees
her as a guilty intruder exposed by a 
dangerous man threatening
her with punishment, and thus finally 
save her. Lisa's exhibitionism
has already been established by her 
obsessive interest in dress and
style, in being a passive image of 
visual perfection; Jeffries'
voyeurism and activity have also been 
established through his work
as a photo-journalist, a maker of 
stories and captor of images.
However, his enforced inactivity, 
binding him to his seat as a
spectator, puts him squarely in the 
phantasy position of the
cinema audience.
In Vertigo, subjective camera 
predominates. Apart from one
flash-back from Judy's point of view, 
the narrative is woven around
what Scottie sees or fails to see. The 
audience follows the growth
of his erotic obsession and subsequent 
despair precisely from his
point of view. Scottie's voyeurism is 
blatant: he falls in love with
a woman he follows and spies on without 
speaking to. Its sadistic
side is equally blatant: he has chosen 
(and freely chosen, for he
had been a successful lawyer) to be a 
policeman, with all the
attendant possibilities of pursuit and 
investigation. As a result,
he follows, watches and falls in love 
with a perfect image of female
beauty and mystery. Once he actually 
confronts her, his erotic drive
is to break her down and force her to 
tell by persistent crossquestioning. 
Then, in the second part of the film, 
he re-enacts his
obsessive involvement with the image he 
loved to watch secretly.
He reconstructs Judy as Madeleine, 
forces her to conform in every
detail to the actual physical 
appearance of his fetish. Her 
exhibitionism, her masochism, make her 
an ideal passive counterpart to
Scottie's active sadistic voyeurism. 
She knows her part is to perform, and 
only by playing it through and then 
replaying it can she
keep Scottie's erotic interest. But in 
the repetition he does
break her down and succeeds in exposing 
her guilt. His curiosity
wins through and she is punished. In 
Vertigo, erotic involvement
with the look is disorientating: the 
spectator's fascination is turned
against him as the narrative carries 
him through and entwines him
with the processes that he is himself 
exercising. The Hitchcock
hero here is firmly placed within the 
symbolic order, in narrative
terms. He has all the attributes of the 
partriachal super-ego. Hence
the spectator, lulled into a false 
sense of security by the apparent
legality of his surrogate, sees through 
his look and finds himself
exposed as complicit, caught in the 
moral ambiguity of looking.
Far from being simply an aside on the 
perversion of the police,
Vertigo focuses on the implications of 
the active/looking, passive/
looked-at split in terms of sexual 
difference and the power of the
male symbolic encapsulated in the hero. 
Marnie, too, performs for
Mark Rutland's gaze and masquerades as 
the perfect to-be-lookedat image. He, 
too, is on the side of the law until, 
drawn in by

obsession with her guilt, her secret, 
he longs to see her in the act
of committing a crime, make her confess 
and thus save her. So he,
too, becomes complicit as he acts out 
the implications of his power.
He controls money and words, he can 
have his cake and eat it.

Summary

 

The psychoanalytic background that has 
been discussed in this article
is relevant to the pleasure and 
unpleasure offered, by traditional
narrative film. The scopophilic 
instinct (pleasure in looking at
another person as an erotic object), 
and, in contradistinction, ego
libido (forming identification 
processes) act as formations, 
mechanisms, which this cinema has 
played on. The image of woman as
(passive) raw material for the (active) 
gaze of man takes the argument a step 
further into the structure of 
representation, adding
a further layer demanded by the 
ideology of the patriarchal order
as it is worked out in its favourite 
cinematic form - illusionistic
narrative film. The argument returns 
again to the psychoanalytic
background in that woman as 
representation signifies castration, 
inducing voyeuristic or fetishistic 
mechanisms to circumvent her threat.
None of these interacting layers is 
intrinsic to film, but it is only in
the film form that they can reach a 
perfect and beautiful contradiction, 
thanks to the possibility in the cinema 
of shifting the
emphasis of the look. It is the place 
of the look that defines cinema,
the possibility of varying it and 
exposing it. This is what makes
cinema quite different in its 
voyeuristic potential from, say, 
striptease, theatre, shows, etc. Going 
far beyond highlighting a woman's
to-be-lopked-at-ness, cinema builds the 
way she is to be looked
at into the spectacle itself. Playing 
on the tension between film
as controlling the dimension of time 
(editing, narrative) and film as
controlling the dimension of space 
(changes in distance, editing),
cinematic codes create a gaze, a world, 
and an object, thereby
producing an illusion cut to the 
measure of desire. It is these
cinematic codes and their relationship 
to formative external structures that 
must be broken down before mainstream 
film and the
pleasure it provides can be challenged.
To begin with (as an ending), the 
voyeuristic-scopophilic look
that is a crucial part of traditional 
filmic pleasure can itself be
broken down. There are three different 
looks associated with
cinema: that of the camera as it 
records the pro-filmic event, that
of the audience as it watches the final 
product, and that of the
characters at each other within the 
screen illusion. The conventions
of narrative film deny the first two 
and subordinate them to the
third, the conscious aim being always 
to eliminate intrusive camera
presence and prevent a distancing 
awareness in the audience.
Without these two absences (the 
material existence of the recording

18 process, the critical reading of the 
spectator), fictional drama
cannot achieve reality, obviousness and 
truth. Nevertheless, as this
article has argued, the structure of 
looking in narrative fiction film
contains a contradiction in its own 
premises: the female image as
a castration threat constantly 
endangers the unity of the diegesis
and bursts through the world of 
illusion as an intrusive, static,
one-dimensional fetish. Thus the two 
looks materially present in
time and space are obsessively 
subordinated to the neurotic needs
of the male ego. The camera becomes the 
mechanism for producing
an illusion of Renaissance space, 
flowing movements compatible
with the human eye, an ideology of 
representation that revolves
around the perception of the subject; 
the camera's look is disavowed
in order to create a convincing world 
in which the spectator's
surrogate can perform with 
verisimilitude. Simultaneously, the
look of the audience is denied an 
intrinsic force: as soon as fetishistic 
representation of the female image 
threatens to break the
spell of illusion, and the erotic image 
on the screen appears directly
(without mediation) to the spectator, 
the fact of fetishisation, concealing 
as it does castration fear, freezes the 
look, fixates the
spectator and prevents him from 
achieving any distance from the
image in front of him.
This complex interaction of looks is 
specific to film. The first
blow against the monolithic 
accumulation of traditional film 
conventions (already undertaken by 
radical film-makers) is to free the
look of the camera into its materiality 
in time and space and the
look of the audience into dialectics, 
passionate detachment. There
is no doubt that this destroys the 
satisfaction, pleasure and
privilege of the ' invisible guest', 
and highlights how film has
depended on voyeuristic active/passive 
mechanisms. Women, whose
image has continually been stolen and 
used for this end, cannot
view the decline of the traditional 
film form with anything much
more than sentimental regret.2
