[INSERT NAME]
I, [INSERT NAME], currently residing at 
[insert current address], and born on 
[insert date of
birth], being of sound body and mind, 
declare this my Will and revoke all prior 
Wills and Codicils.
ARTICLE ONE
DEFINITIONS
[Optional-use only if there are (1) 
ambiguous terms in the Will which require 
defining; (2) you would like to
attach a special definition to an otherwise 
ordinary word – see "my children" below; or 
(3) if you would like to
limit or broaden the definition of an 
otherwise ordinary word (see "personal 
property")]
1. "Beneficiary" means the recipient of a 
bequest made by this Will.
2. "My children" means my unborn child whom 
is currently being carried by my spouse, and 
any
other children born to or adopted by me 
after I execute this Will.
3. "My grandchildren" means any children 
born to or adopted by my children after I 
execute this
Will.

specifically provided to a beneficiary or 
not effectively
disposed of by this Will.
5. "Personal property" includes all of my 
clothing, furs, jewelry, household goods and 
furnishings,
automobiles and all other similar property. 
"Personal property" does not include my book
collection.
ARTICLE TWO
BEQUESTS
[Use this section for specific bequests for 
specific beneficiaries. Each section's 
heading within this Article should
identify the nature of the specific bequest. 
If the intended beneficiary has already been 
described in this Will, a
sufficient description consists of (1) your 
relationship to the beneficiary and the 
beneficiary's first name; or (2)
the beneficiary's full name. If the intended 
beneficiary is not related to you through 
blood, a brief reason as to
why that bequest is for that beneficiary 
will help your Will avoid challenges and 
ambiguity. Remember, your
intentions will be accorded more certainty 
the more descriptive you are.]
A. Real Property
1. [Insert address of real property desired 
for bequest]
I leave to [insert relationship to 
beneficiary- e.g., "my mother"], [INSERT 
FIRST
BENEFICIARY'S NAME], currently residing at 
[insert first beneficiary's address], if she 
survives
me, title to my property located at [insert 
address of real property desired for bequest 
– this should
be the same address used in paragraph 
(A)(1)'s heading]. If [INSERT FIRST 
BENEFICIARY'S
NAME] does not survive me, I bequeath title 
to this property to my [insert relationship 
to
beneficiary- see above], [INSERT SECOND 
BENEFICIARY'S NAME], currently residing at
[insert second beneficiary's current 
address]. If both [INSERT FIRST NAME OF FIRST
BENEFICIARY] and [INSERT FIRST NAME OF 
SECOND BENEFICIARY] do not survive
me, title of this property shall be sold. 
The revenue earned from this sale shall be 
placed into
residue. If this property is no longer in my 
estate upon my death, this bequest has no 
effect.
2. [Insert desired address for bequest]
[The format of this paragraph is the same as 
the format of paragraph (A)(1) of this 
Article]
B. [Insert general description of the 
bequest- e.g., my wedding ring]
[The format of this paragraph is similar to 
that of paragraph (A)(1) of this Article. 
Remember to describe the
item for bequest and the beneficiary of the 
bequest.]
I leave to [insert relationship to the 
beneficiary- e.g., "my mother"], [INSERT 
BENEFICIARY'S
NAME], my [insert description of specific 
bequest- e.g., "my 5.4 karat diamond wedding 
ring"].
Upon my death, if [INSERT BENEFICIARY'S 
FIRST NAME], has predeceased me, my [insert
same description of bequest as used in the 
preceding sentence] shall be sold.
C. Personal Property
[This is an example of the applying the 
definitions section, Article I, above. Here, 
"personal property" includes
all of my clothing, furs, jewelry, household 
goods and furnishings, automobiles and all 
other similar property.
"Personal property" does not include my book 
collection as prescribed in that section of 
this Will.]
My personal property shall be sold. The 
revenue earned from this sale shall be 
placed into residue.
D. Book Collection
[This is an example of how you can tailor 
your specific bequests to your wishes]
My [insert relationship to beneficiary], 
[INSERT NAME OF BENEFICIARY], currently 
residing
at [insert beneficiary's address], if she 
survives me, shall receive my book 
collection upon my death.
If, at the time of my death, my book 
collection has a market value of less than 
$10,000, [INSERT
BENEFICIARY'S FIRST NAME] shall receive my 
book collection plus cash such that the total
market value of this bequest to [INSERT 
BENEFICIARY'S FIRST NAME] equals $10,000.
[INSERT BENEFICIARY'S FIRST NAME] has always 
admired my book collection and this
bequest is made to honor her dedication to
my family and myself. If [INSERT 
BENEFICIARY'S
FIRST NAME] does not survive me, or has been 
dismissed of her services prior to my death, 
she
shall not receive any bequest and my book 
collection shall be sold. In the event that 
my book
collection is sold, the revenue earned from 
this sale shall be placed into residue.
E. General Cash Bequests
1. To [INSERT NAME OF INTENDED BENEFIICARIES]
[The format of this paragraph is similar to 
that of those paragraphs above. Remember, 
the more descriptive you
are the less likely this Will will be 
challenged]
ARTICLE THREE
TRUSTS
[This article is an example of how you can 
establish future interests for beneficiaries 
in your Will. You may
prescribe who the money is for, how it shall 
be used, when it shall be used, etc.]
A. To my CHILDREN
["CHILDREN" as defined in the definitions 
section above]
Upon my death, all stocks, bank accounts, 
and cash that I own, along with any property 
I acquire
after the execution of this Will, shall be 
placed in a trust for my surviving CHILDREN. 
The
property in this trust shall be shared 
equally by my surviving CHILDREN and shall 
maintain each
beneficiary's general health and welfare, 
including education. If any of my CHLDREN 
does not
survive me, then each non-surviving CHILD'S 
share of this trust shall be shared equally 
by their
surviving children, my GRANDCHILDREN, should 
they have any. Once a beneficiary becomes
eighteen years of age, that beneficiary 
shall receive its share of the trust to be 
used however the
beneficiary pleases. If no beneficiaries 
survive me, the property from this trust 
shall be placed into
residue.
B. To [INSERT NAME OF INTENDED BENEFICIARY]
Upon my death, [desired amount] shall be 
placed in trust for my [insert relationship 
to beneficiary],
[INSERT NAME OF BENEFICIARY], if she 
survives me. This bequest is made to express 
my
love for my [insert relationship to 
beneficiary], who have significantly 
impacted my personal
growth and development. The property in this 
trust shall be used to maintain the general 
health
and welfare of the beneficiary. If the 
beneficiary survives me, the property in 
this trust shall be
placed into residue.
C. TRUSTEE
[Here, lay out the trustee's rights and 
duties]
My Personal Representative pursuant to this 
Will shall act as the trustee for all of the 
trusts
provided by this Will. The trustee shall
determine whether the conditions for a given 
trust,
prescribed in this Article, have been 
satisfied such that the property in the 
relevant trust should be
disbursed to its beneficiaries. 
Disbursements made in furtherance of a given 
trust's purpose or to
reimburse the trustee for reasonable 
expenses shall be made out of the interest 
accrued from
investments within the corresponding trust, 
if possible. The trustee may invade the 
principal of a
trust only if the trustee deems absolutely 
necessary to further the given trust's 
purpose. Only the
trustee may invade the principal of a trust.
ARTICLE FOUR
RESIDUE
[The Residue of your estate is all that is 
remaining less the specific bequests 
prescribed above. This Article lays
out what is to happen with the residue of 
your estate.]
The residue of my estate shall be placed 
into the trust for my CHILDREN, provided by 
Article
3(A) of this Will. If the CHILDREN'S trust 
no longer exists, the residue shall be 
placed into the
trust for my [insert relationship to 
beneficiary], [INSERT NAME OF BENEFICIARY], 
provided
by Article 3(B) of this Will. If the trust 
pursuant to Article 3(B) of this Will no 
longer exists, the
residue shall be donated to a charity with a 
purpose consistent with [insert your wish]. 
In this
instance, my Personal Representative shall 
select the charity to receive the residue of 
my property.
ARTICLE FIVE
APPOINTMENT OF POWERS

"Guardian" means caretaker of the person and 
property of each of my surviving children 
who are
not yet eighteen years old. Upon my death, 
[insert relationship to primary guardian],

GUARDIAN] is unable to act as guardian for 
any reason, [insert relationship to second 
guardian],
[INSERT NAME OF SECOND GUARDIAN], shall

[Your personal representative should be your

also act as
trustee for the trusts provided by this 
Will, pursuant to Article 3(D) of this Will.
ARTICLE SIX
ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
[This Article deals with those matters which 
frequently cause ambiguity and lead to 
challenges of a Will]
A. Beneficiary Under Eighteen Years Old
Any bequest to a beneficiary not yet 
eighteen years old shall vest in that 
beneficiary, with my
Personal Representative entitled to the 
discretion to retain the asset until the 
beneficiary becomes
eighteen years old. My Personal 
Representative may distribute all or part of 
a bequest to a
beneficiary younger than eighteen years, if 
it is in the best interest of that 
beneficiary. If a
beneficiary dies before reaching the age of 
eighteen, the relevant bequest shall be 
placed into
residue.
B. Otherwise Incapacitated Beneficiary
Any bequest left to a beneficiary who is 
incapacitated for any reason shall be 
disbursed when the
beneficiary is no longer incapacitated, 
dies, or when my Personal Representative 
deems it
necessary, whichever comes first. My 
Personal Representative shall deem a 
beneficiary
incapacitated, at his discretion, for the 
purposes of this Will.
C. Simultaneous Death Clause
For purposes of this Will, it shall be 
interpreted that I have survived a 
beneficiary if that beneficiary
dies simultaneously with me or if 
circumstances cast doubt as to which one of 
us had died first.
D. Gifts Given to a Beneficiary During My 
Lifetime
Gifts given to a beneficiary during my 
lifetime which are provided by this Will to 
be bequeathed to
that same beneficiary upon my death shall 
satisfy the corresponding bequest provided 
by this Will.
E. Insufficient Funds
If at the time of my death the value of my 
estate is insufficient to satisfy the 
entirety of this Will,
the trusts provided by Articles 3(A) and 
3(B) of this Will shall have priority over 
all other bequests,
with the CHILDREN'S trust having highest
priority. My Personal Representative shall 
allocate my
estate in trust as necessary to provide the 
general welfare for those beneficiaries 
prescribed the
relevant sections of this Will.
F. Omission Acknowledgements
[By acknowledging your conscious omissions, 
you guarantee that a person who would expect 
to be a beneficiary
has no legal recourse when you don't include 
them as a beneficiary- e.g., an uninvolved 
parent]
1. [INSERT NAME OF OMISSION]

under no duress, I acknowledge the omission
