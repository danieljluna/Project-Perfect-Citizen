Harduwich Recorded Speech


[CROWD CHEERS AS VINCENT STEPS TO THE PODIUM]


"Hello Harduwich! How is everyone doing?"


[CROWD SCREAMS]


"...as many of you know, I have been upfront
with what I believe since day one. Raymond has
never been truly clear on his policy stances,
and that is a problem. Well since day one, my
policies have always been known, like free
education and stable taxes. Raymond says he is
for the middle and poor class, but he needs
to understand that in order to solve our
current problems, we first have to go to the
root, which is education..."


"...Now we cannot let Raymond win because the
consequences are bigger than just having a
different governor, he is going to elect a
supreme court member and they will hold
position for life, we don't want Raymond to get
that opportunity. This will affect the
country more than you know it..."


"...Good night everyone. It has been a great
pleasure talking with this group of people!"
