GENERIC SHORTFORM NDA

THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as 
____________________ ("Effective Date"), by
and between ____________________, ("the 
Disclosing Party") and ____________________,
("the Recipient") (collectively, "the 
Parties").
Purpose for Disclosure ("Business Purpose"): 
____________________
The Parties hereby agree as follows:
1. For purposes of this Agreement, 
"Confidential Information" shall mean any 
and all non-public
information, including, without limitation, 
technical, developmental, marketing, sales, 
operating,
performance, cost, know-how, business plans, 
business methods, and process information, 
disclosed
to the Recipient. For convenience, the 
Disclosing Party may, but is not required 
to, mark written
Confidential Information with the legend 
"Confidential" or an equivalent designation.
2. All Confidential Information disclosed to 
the Recipient will be used solely for the 
Business
Purpose and for no other purpose whatsoever. 
The Recipient agrees to keep the Disclosing 
Party's
Confidential Information confidential and to 
protect the confidentiality of such 
Confidential
Information with the same degree of care 
with which it protects the confidentiality 
of its own
confidential information, but in no event 
with less than a reasonable degree of care. 
Recipient may
disclose Confidential Information only to 
its employees, agents, consultants and 
contractors on a
need-to-know basis, and only if such 
employees, agents, consultants and 
contractors have executed
appropriate written agreements with 
Recipient sufficient to enable Recipient to 
enforce all the
provisions of this Agreement. Recipient 
shall not make any copies of Disclosing 
Party's
Confidential Information except as needed 
for the Business Purpose. At the request of 
Disclosing
Party, Recipient shall return to Disclosing 
Party all Confidential Information of 
Disclosing Party
(including any copies thereof) or certify 
the destruction thereof.
3. All right title and interest in and to 
the Confidential Information shall remain 
with Disclosing
Party or its licensors. Nothing in this 
Agreement is intended to grant any rights to 
Recipient under
any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or 
trade secrets of Disclosing Party. ALL 
CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". THE 
DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, 
REGARDING
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR 
ITS ACCURACY,
COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.
4.
The obligations and limitations set forth 
herein regarding Confidential Information 
shall not
apply to information which is: (a) at any 
time in the public domain, other than by a 
breach on the
part of the Recipient; or (b) at any time 
rightfully received from a third party which 
had the right
to and transmits it to the Recipient without 
any obligation of confidentiality.
5.
In the event that the Recipient shall breach 
this Agreement, or in the event that a breach
appears to be imminent, the Disclosing Party 
shall be entitled to all legal and equitable 
remedies
afforded it by law, and in addition may 
recover all reasonable costs and attorneys' 
fees incurred in
seeking such remedies. If the Confidential 
Information is sought by any third party, 
including by
way of subpoena or other court process, the 
Recipient shall inform the Disclosing Party 
of the
request in sufficient time to permit the 
Disclosing Party to object to and, if 
necessary, seek court
intervention to prevent the disclosure.
6.
The validity, construction and 
enforceability of this Agreement shall be 
governed in all
respects by the law of the 
____________________. This Agreement may not 
be amended except
in writing signed by a duly authorized 
representative of the respective Parties. 
This Agreement shall
control in the event of a conflict with any 
other agreement between the Parties with 
respect to the
subject matter hereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have 
executed this Agreement as of the date first 
above
written.
