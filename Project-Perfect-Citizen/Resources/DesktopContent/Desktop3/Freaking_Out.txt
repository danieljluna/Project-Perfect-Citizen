WE're two days into Office and we're already
in the shit. Some anonymous rat told the FEC
my campaign resorted to voter fraud to get
elected. We need a way to get these FEC
allegations deligitmized. You were Dad's
Chief of Staff, how the hell did you two
survive in th Senate for 30 years?

Help,
Vincent

"Semper in excretia" as your Father and I
used to always say. It's part of an old Latin
saying that was more a joke than anything at
first;

"Semper in excretia sumus solim profundum
variat" or we're always in the shit; only the
depth varies. It was a way Alexander and I
could get our bearings in the constant
chaos of Congressional life. There's wisdom
in using humor to defuse political tensions.

The only way you're gonna get out of this is
by figuring out who gave the anonymous tip to
the FEC. Find them, and end this.

I believe in you Vincent. Get your nose to
the grindstone - the longer this goes on, the
worse it'll be for you.
