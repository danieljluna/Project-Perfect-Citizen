We're two days into office and we're already
in the shit. Someone told the FEC
my campaign resorted to election fraud.
We need a way to get these FEC
allegations delegitimize. You were Dad's
Chief of Staff, how the hell did you two
survive in th Senate for 30 years?

Help,
Vincent

Vincent,

It's interesting you'd use that phrasing.
Your Father and I had a running joke we'd
drop to eachother when things got rough:
"Semper in excretia". It's part of an old
Latin saying; "Semper in excretia sumus solim
profundum variat". It means 'we're always in
the shit; only the depth varies. It was a way
Alexander and I could get our bearings in the
constant chaos of Congressional life.
Sometimes only a dirty joke can get your mind
off the angst of public service.

More to the point, you've got very little
time to turn this around. Get your PR team on
this ASAP. But the real solution is finding
who sent that anonymous report.

Find them, and you can clear your name.

I believe in you Vincent.
