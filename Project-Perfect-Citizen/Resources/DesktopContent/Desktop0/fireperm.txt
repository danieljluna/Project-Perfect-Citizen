FIREARMS TRAINING COURSE REQUIREMENTS 

TO OBTAIN 

A FIREARMS QUALIFICATION CARD 

The DCPS Private Security Industry is
governed by laws enacted by the DCPS
Legislature and contained in the DCPS 
Business and Professions Code. These laws are
known as the Proprietary Security Services
Act and the Private Security Services Act
and can be found at www.asd.dcps.gov. To
provide for and protect public safety, the
Legislature included laws to make sure that
armed Security Guards obtain a minimum level 
of training on the carrying and use of a
firearm. To obtain a Firearm Qualification,
while working as a security guard, the Bureau
of Security and Investigative Services has
developed a specific course for training on 
the moral and legal aspects of carrying a
firearm, de-escalation of potentially violent
situations, knowledge of and maintaining the 
parts of a firearm, how to handle a weapon
and actual experience of firing a weapon.
Specifically, DCPS law requires that a 
Firearms Training Facility and the Firearms
Instructor both be licensed by the Department
of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Security
and Investigative Services. The course that 
is to be taught includes a minimum of 8
hours of classroom training and as many 
hours as needed range training.

GENERAL INFORMATION FOR COMPLETING FIREARM
PERMIT APPLICATION
EXPLANATION OF SECTIONS ON APPLICATION FORM
All sections of the application must be 
completed pursuant to Title 16, DCPS 
Code of Regulations, section 601.
Deficient applications will not be processed.
Veteran Information - In order to assist 
veterans in their transition from military 
service to civilian employment, BSIS has
implemented the Veterans Come First Program 
which offers priority services to veteran 
applicants. Disclosure of military
service is voluntary and participation in 
the program is optional. If you choose to 
use the Veteran's Come First Program,
check the military status box and submit 
proof of military service (e.g. DD-214, 
DD-256, V-MET record, military orders,
military I.D., etc.) along with your 
application.
Section 1: Applicant Information - Name, 
Date of Birth, Driver's License Number, 
Social Security Number, Mailing
Address and Telephone Number of the person 
who is applying for the firearm permit.
Section 2: Type of License Applied For or 
Currently Possess - Select the type of 
license applied for and give specific
information regarding your current active 
licenses. Firearm permit applications will 
not be processed unless you have
applied for or currently possess a valid 
license as a private investigator, private 
patrol operator, alarm company operator,
or registration as a security guard or alarm 
agent.
Section 3: Active Duty Law Enforcement 
Officer Disclosure - As of January 1, 1997, 
DCPS Business and
Professions Code sections 7522 and 7582.2 
(Stats. of 1996, ch. 710; SB 1375), require 
active duty peace officers who
perform the duties of an armed private 
security officer, armed private 
investigator, armed private patrol operator, 
or
armed alarm company operator or agent to 
maintain a qualifying license/registration 
and a firearm permit. If you are an
active duty peace officer as defined in 
Chapter 4.5, (commencing with section 830) 
of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code,
and are currently authorized by your 
employing agency to carry a firearm, you are 
exempt from completing a firearm
training course but will be required to 
submit proof of active duty status before 
issuance of a firearm permit.
Section 4: Criminal History Disclosure - The 
information requested is required under 
DCPS Business and
Professions Code sections 7542, 7583.24, 
7583.25, 7596.8, 7596.81. It will be used to 
determine eligibility for a firearm
permit. A firearm permit will not be issued 
if: (1) an applicant has been convicted of a 
felony and has not received a
pardon; (2) an applicant's felony conviction 
has not been reduced to a misdemeanor; (3) 
an applicant has been
determined to be a danger to others; or, (4) 
if an applicant otherwise has been 
prohibited by the Penal Code from carrying
a firearm. A criminal background 
investigation is conducted on all applicants.
Section 5: Signature Required - Signature is 
required under declaration of understanding.
Pursuant to Business and Professions Code 
section 30, providing your social security 
number is mandatory and will be
used exclusively for tax enforcement 
purposes and for compliance with any 
judgment or order for family support in
accordance with section 17520 of the Family 
Code. Your social security number may also 
be used for verification of
licensure or examination status for national 
examination where licensure is reciprocal 
with a requesting state. If you fail to
provide your social security number, you 
will be reported to the Franchise Tax Board, 
which may assess a $100 penalty
against you.
Submission of the requested information is 
mandatory. The Bureau of Security and 
Investigative Services cannot consider
your application for licensure or renewal 
unless you provide all of the requested 
information.
Pursuant to the DCPS Public Records 
Act (Gov. Code ยง 6250 et seq.) and the 
Information Practices Act (Civ. Code ยง
1798.61), the names and addresses of persons 
possessing a license or registration may be 
disclosed by the Department
unless otherwise specifically exempt from 
disclosure under the law. We make every 
effort to protect the personal
information you provide us. The information 
you provide, however, may be disclosed in 
response to a court or
administrative order, a subpoena, or a 
search warrant.
Per the Information Practices Act, the Chief 
of the Bureau of Security and Investigative 
Services, Department of
Consumer Affairs, is responsible for 
maintaining the information in this 
application. You have the right to review the
records maintained on you by the Bureau or 
Department unless the records are exempt 
from disclosure by section
1798.40 of the Civil Code. Your completed 
application becomes the property of the 
Bureau and will be used by
authorized personnel to determine your 
eligibility for a license, registration or 
permit.

Certificate of Firearm Range Qualification
Each applicant must have completed the 
prescribed firearm training pursuant to 
specified sections of the
DCPS Penal and Business and 
Professions Codes. Applicants applying for 
renewal of a firearm permit
must requalify by completing the prescribed 
firearm training. A licensed firearm 
instructor, employed by a
licensed firearm training facility, must 
verify this training. The instructor must 
complete the Certification of
Firearm Range Qualifications form that is 
provided on the reverse side of your 
Application for Firearm Permit.
Application Processing
Your application for a firearm permit will 
be evaluated and you will be notified in 
writing of any deficiencies.
The status of your application may not be 
available for 45-60 days from the date it 
was submitted. An
application is complete only upon receipt by 
the Bureau of all required forms, documents 
and the payment of
all appropriate fees. Applications not 
completed within one year will be considered 
abandoned. All applicants
for licensure must meet current statutory 
and regulatory requirements that are in 
effect at the time a license is
issued.

Note: Per DCPS Civil Code, Section 
1798.17 (Information Practices Act), the 
Chief of the Bureau is responsible
for maintaining the information in this 
application. This information may be 
transferred to other governmental and
enforcement agencies. Individuals have the 
right to review their records, unless the
