2. Submit the original of this form (either 
typewritten or printed legibly) and total
fees payable to the Bureau of Alcohol,

post office box listed above. (CAUTION: 
Submission of this application does
NOT authorize you to engage in any of the 
activities covered by the requested
license or permit. The license or permit 
must be received before operations
commence.) Include your social security or 
employer identification number on
your check or money order.
3. If separate sheets are needed to respond 
to the questions, they must be identified
with your name and address at the top of the 
page and reference the question
number being explained.
4. A separate or additional license is not 
required for storage facilities operated by
the applicant as an integral part of one 
business premises, or to cover a location

required records.
5. One PERMIT is required for an individual 
or business entity to acquire use, or
transport explosives.
6. A separate application and LICENSE fee 
are required for each premises on which
explosive materials are, or will be, 
manufactured, imported, or distributed.
7. It is not necessary for a licensed 
manufacturer or licensed importer (for 
purposes
of sale or distribution) to also obtain a 
dealer's license in order to engage in
business on his or her licensed premises as 
a dealer in explosives materials. In the
case of a licensed manufacturer, a separate 
license is not required with respect to
onsite manufacturing.
8. A photograph of each responsible person 
listed in item 11 MUST accompany this
application. The photograph must be 2 x 2 
inches in size, clearly showing a full
frontal view of the features of the 
responsible person with head bare, with the
distance from the top of the head to the 
point of the chin approximately 1 1/4

within the last 6 months prior to the date
of application.
A completed FD-258 (Fingerprint

person, including sole proprietors, MUST 
also accompany this application. The
fingerprints must be clear for accurate

this application.
10. For item 22 use the attached Explosives 
Storage Magazine Description
Worksheet to describe each storage facility 
(magazine). You may photocopy the
worksheet if you have more than one 
magazine. For the purpose of this
worksheet, "barricade" is defined as the 
effective screening of a magazine
containing explosive materials from another 
magazine, a building, a railway, or a
highway, either by a natural barricade or by 
an artificial barricade. To be
properly barricaded, a straight line from 
the top of any sidewall of the magazine
containing explosive materials to the eave 
line of any other magazine or building,
or to a point 12 feet above the center of a 
railway or highway, will pass through
the natural or artificial barricade. A 
"contingency plan" is required in the event
the explosive materials cannot be used 
within the same day of receipt. For
example, a sufficient "contingency plan" 
would include a

letter or statement from someone having 
approved storage facilities allowing the
applicant use of his facilities should the 
need arise.
11. The certification in item 23 must be 
signed (executed) by the owner, a partner, or
in the case of a corporation, association, 
etc., by an officer duty authorized to
sign for the applicant.

Definitions
1. Under Indictment or Information or 
Convicted in Any Court. An indictment,
information, or conviction in any Federal, 
State, or local court.
2. Alien. An alien in the United States 
means any person who is not a citizen or
national of the United States.
3. Responsible Person. An individual who has 
the power to direct the management
and policies of the applicant pertaining to 
explosive materials. For example,
responsible persons generally include sole 
proprietors and explosives facility site
managers. In the case of a corporation, 
association, or similar organization,
responsible persons generally include 
corporate directors and officers, as well as
stockholders who have the power to direct 
management and policies.
4. Employee Possessor. An employee possessor 
is an individual who has actual or
constructive possession of explosive 
materials during the course of his
employment. Actual possession exists when a 
person is in immediate possession
or control of explosive materials (e.g., an 
employee who physically handles
explosive materials as part of the 
production process; an employee who handles
explosive materials in order to ship, 
transport, or sell them; or an employee, such
as a blaster, who actually uses explosive 
materials). Constructive possession
exists when an employee lacks direct 
physical control over explosive materials,
but knowingly has the power and intention to 
exercise dominion and control over
the explosive materials, either directly or 
indirectly through others (e.g., an
employee at a construction site who keeps 
keys for magazines in which explosive
materials are stored, or who directs the use 
of explosive materials by other
employees.)
5. A User Permit. A User Permit authorizes 
the holder, on a continuing basis, to
acquire for his own use and not for resale, 
explosive materials from an explosives
licensee in interstate or foreign commerce, 
and to transport explosive materials so
acquired in interstate or foreign commerce. 
A User Permit is issued for 3 years
and is renewable.
6. Limited Permit. A limited permit 
authorizes the holder to receive for his use
explosive materials from a licensee or 
permittee in his State of residence on no
more than 6 occasions during the 12-month 
period in which the permit is valid. A
limited permit does not authorize the 
receipt or transportation of explosive
materials in interstate or foreign commerce.

7. Manufacturer. Any person engaged in the
business of manufacturing explosive
materials for purposes of sale or 
distribution or for his own use.
8. Importer. Any person engaged in the 
business of importing or bringing explosive
materials into the United States for 
purposes of sale or distribution.
9. Dealer. Any person engaged in the 
business of distributing explosive materials 
at
wholesale or retail.
10. High Explosives. Explosive materials 
which can be caused to detonate by means
of a blasting cap when unconfined (for 
example, dynamite).
11. Low Explosives. Explosive materials 
which can be caused to deflagrate when
confined (for example, black powder).
12. Blasting Agents. Any material or 
mixture, consisting of fuel and oxidizer,
intended for blasting, not otherwise defined 
as an explosive: Provided that the
finished product, as mixed for use or 
shipment, cannot be detonated by means of
a numbered eight test blasting cap when 
unconfined (for example, ammonium
nitrate fuel oil).
Note: There are now six broad categories of 
explosives licenses and permits that
shall determine the type of business each 
licensee or permittee is engaged in:
Manufacturer of Explosives, Dealer of 
Explosives, Importer of Explosives, User
of Explosives, User (Limited) of Explosives, 
and Limited Permit (Interstate
Only).
Exceptions
1. A person who has been convicted of a 
felony, or any other crime, for which the
judge could have imprisoned the person for 
more than one year, is not prohibited
from shipping, transporting, possessing, or 
receiving explosives if: (1) the
conviction was properly invalidated by a 
court on the basis that the conviction was
unconstitutional; (2) in the case of a 
Federal conviction, the person received a
Presidential pardon; or (3) ATF granted 
relief from Federal explosives disabilities
under 18 U.S.C. 845(b), 27 CFR 555.142.

3. Routine uses. The information will be 
used by ATF to make a determination as
set forth in paragraph 2. In addition, 
information may be directly disclosed to
other Federal, State, foreign and local law 
enforcement and regulatory agency
personnel to verify information on the 
application and to aid in the performance of
their duties with respect to the regulation 
of explosives unless such disclosure is
prohibited by law. Finally, the information 
may be disclosed to member of the
public in order to verify the information on 
the application where such disclosure
is not prohibited by law.
4. Effects of not supplying the requested 
information. Failure to supply complete
information will delay processing and may 
cause denial of the application.
5. Disclosure of social security number. 
Disclosure of the individual's social
security number is voluntary. Under 18 
U.S.C. 842(f), 843, and Executive Order
9397, November 22, 1943, ATF has the 
authority to solicit an individual's social
security number. The number may be used to 
verify the individual's identity.
