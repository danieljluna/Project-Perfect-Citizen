I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore.
Officer, I think it's best if we split up.
I don't think I'm ready for another marriage.





















Through out history there have been people
who seek great power in this world. I was
one of them and so are you. You have admitted
you are unjust, guilty, and corrupted. And
you have blindly fallen in love with someone
you do not know of. For what? Power?
Information? Is my misfortune your pleasure?

I understand you may hate me. 
I hate myself too. But this is my fate
and I am glad that there is someone 
alive who can see it.

Officer, I am a broken man. So I offer myself
to you not as a martyr, but as a mirror to 
yourself. If you have any ounce of divine 
justice left within you I emplore you to heed
my warning. Why are you here with me in this
moment?

And that is why I am asking you shut down
Project Perfect Citizen and dispel the DCPS.

In the directory next to this file contains 
the three documents that whistleblower was 
missing when he leaked the domestic
surveillance plans. I have overwritten
the submit command on this desktop extraction
to upload directly to the SecureNetwork. 
Every person on the planet will receive a 
copy of whatever you send through it. 

And so now I leave you to complete my story.

Thank you for joining me for this brief 
moment. If you don't mind, I would like to 
return to being alone.
