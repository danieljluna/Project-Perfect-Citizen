I know, I know. Thank you for 
confessing that. And don't worry, I won't 
submit that as evidence against you ;)

Where were we. Ah, yes. 

Just when I was getting bored with this
job, BOOM, bombshell. As the team 
and I were working on the shift towards
launching the domestic surveillance 
initiative, some jackass whistleblower
wannabe decides to leak the whole thing.

When the press got a hold of it, holy 
shit, it was near World War III in this 
country. Of course the DCPS denied it -
how were they going to scare the public into 
believing their "keeping our world secure"
bullshit with this over their head? 

After JP bumped me up to SYS_ADMIN_2,
I was personally selected for this 
guy's desktop extraction. We dug up 
everything on this whistlebloweer guy 
- from crazy ex-lovers to the age he 
stopped wearing diapers. We had to plant 
some lobotomy conspiracy shit on his desktop
to invalidate his claim. You know, make him 
look crazy. Once the press ate that up, 
the whole story just disappeared. Of course 
he was missing some pretty crucial
evidence to really fuck over the DCPS. 
If he had that, well, things may
have been a little different.

You know officer, I think that was when 
I realized something. I had become the most
powerful man in the world. I sent an innocent
man to jail - for what? Telling the truth?
You see the truth is only helpful when it's
on your side.

I had become corrupt, just like you. 
Oh don't fucking sit there and pretend like
you wouldn't have done the same god damn 
thing.

You are corrupt. Say it. I won't move on 
until you do.
