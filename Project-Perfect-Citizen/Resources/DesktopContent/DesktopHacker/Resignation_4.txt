Aww, so you agree you are a disgusting, 
guilty, pathetic pig? Thank you for 
confessing that. Don't worry I won't 
submit that as evidence ;)

Where were we. Ah, yes. 

Just when I was getting bored with this
job, BOOM, bombshell. Some jackass hero 
leaked the DCPS announcementthat the 
Perfect Citizen project would be used 
to monitor domestic terrorism activities.
When the press got a hold of it, holy 
shit,it was World War III in this country.
Of course the DCPS denied it - how were
they going to scare the public into 
believing their "keeping our world secure"
bullshit with this over their head? 

Can you imagine how fucked up this was
for me? The thin veneer of patriotic 
adulation I had been feeding on now 
gave me the rights to monitor my own 
fucking neighbor!

I didn't believe it. Until I recieved
a message from a little unknown 
"OriginalCitizen". He was to me 
(like I am very much to you) a savior
from heaven cast down to save me from my 
guilt. He provided me with a console 
command to pipe directly into the 
mainframe and access any computer on 
the SecureNet. What I found turned 
my stomach. 

Only someone as corrupt as my past self
could comprehend the information I found.
In order for me to share this with you,
I'll need you prove you're as corrupt
as I was. Please, tell me you are as 
corrupt as I was.
