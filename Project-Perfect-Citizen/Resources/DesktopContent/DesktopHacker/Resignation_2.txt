At first I was assigned to Foreign Operations
- the original branch of the DCPS. The
organization began as an initiative against
foreign terror groups. However, it soon took
on application at home as well.

When I was eventually transferred to Domestic
I kept on as though nothing had changed.

Off and on I'd run into an guiltless civilian
target. I let them off without charge of
course. Going into their computers, leaving
no trace. Occasionally it struck me as absurd
voyeurism, but those moments could be waved
off as simply the cost of security.

Every criminal I booked bolstered my faith in
the DCPS. Scum get put away, and I get paid.
Good work Isaac I'd say to myself.

Good work.
