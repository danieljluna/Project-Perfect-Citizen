Boo! Haha!

See, I knew you could trust me! So without
further adieu, let's get started!

When I first joined the DCPS I was assigned
onto Foreign Ops - the original branch
of the DCPS. They needed someone to help 
crack international decryption protocols.
You know, to catch terrorists and shit like
that. Of course, I couldn't really do much
sitting at a permission status of a sys.
admin. So I mostly dicked around looking 
at the nudes co-workers found on desktop
extractions. I'm sure you've run into 
invalid permission errors yourself. Sucks
doesn't it?

The DCPS system interface went through 
a hell of a lot of iterations. They 
designed it to be just soul-crushingly 
boring enough to keep you from killing 
yourself. Unlike you, all we had was a 
training manual to show us what to do. 
They brought on the annoying floppy disc 
because HR wanted to improve productivity. 
Annoying little fucker.

But ahh, yes. My first assignment from JP.
You know JP, right? He was my boss too.
My first bust was a drug ring off the 
Mexican border. My pipeline extraction 
was pretty simple - 5 or 6 innocent guys with
one super guilty muchacho. Crazy 
motherfucker, he was. He'd cut off ears 
of those who didn't listen to him. I mean
really fucked up shit.

Crazy enough, the desktop extraction was 
actually his kid, Diego. Good kid, just
caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Of course, me being the idiot I was back 
then, I ended up booking him because of 
the shit his dad did. 

I can't remember if I felt guilty for 
that one. Though looking back, that was 
a pretty unjust thing I did. I mean
the kid ended up dying in jail. Yikes! 

But what the hell, you're probably just as
unjust as I was. In fact, I bet you're worse.
Actually yeah, tell me you're unjust.
