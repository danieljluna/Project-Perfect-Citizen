See, I knew you could trust me!
Let the show begin!

So, at first I was assigned as
a System Admin on Foreign Ops
- the original branch of the 
DCPS. Not a lot of people know
this, but the Perfect Citizen 
Project actually started out 
as a program meant to 
spy on OTHER countries. You know,
to catch terrorists and shit like
that. Boy, have we changed.

The DCPS system interface
went through a hell of a lot of
iterations when I first came on board. 
They wanted to make sure they could 
capture just the right amount of
soul-crushing boredom to keep you
busy enough from killing yourself.
You see, unlike you, all we had was
a training manual to show us what
to do. Fuck that floppy disc.

But ahh, yes. My first assignment
from JP. You know JP, right? He
was my boss too. My first bust was
a drug ring off the Mexican border.
My pipeline extraction was pretty 
simple - 5 or 6 innocent guys with
one super guilty muchacho. Crazy
motherfucker, he was. He'd cut off
ears of those who didn't listen to 
him. 

The desktop extraction was 
actually his son, Diego. Good kid,
and totally innocent. Of course,
me being the idiot I was back then,
I booked him because of the shit
his dad did. I can't tell what was
worse, the shit I did to him or
the shit his dad did to others.
Looking back, that was a fairly 
unjust thing for me to do, 
wouldn't you agree? But what the
hell, you're probably just as
unjust as me.

No use hiding it. Admit you are unjust.
