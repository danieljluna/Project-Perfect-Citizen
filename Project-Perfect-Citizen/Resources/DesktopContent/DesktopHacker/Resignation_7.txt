I couldn't believe it. Spying on people
in their own country was controversial enough
but this? 

There's this old saying I heard my dad once say.
"You can kill the bad guy, but you can't kill
what he stands for". As crazy as that old lying,
wife-beating asshole was, I think he was onto
something. 

Officer, I've been quite playful with you up
until now. So allow me to be blunt.

OriginalCitizen wasn't warning us about the danger
of our enemies, but rather what happens to people
like you and I when fear and power consume us.

You, like all of us, want to know more. Keep in mind
you have admitted to being and unjust, guilty, 
corrupt, surveillance officer who ruins lives. Just
to find out what lies at the bottom of this file
tree? Does this not prove your hunger for more? 
Have you not questioned why you are here

And so the choice is yours. In this folder
lies three files I have created that prove
the guilt of the DCPS. This Desktop Extraction
has been overwritten to submit to the SecureNetwork
and sent as an email to every person on the 
Network. You may not understand
what they mean, but if OriginalCitizen is still
alive, he may. There is hope for this world.

I write this final letter to you on my last night
as Isaac Durov. Tomorrow I will become James Bryon. 
And I will lose my memory, my thoughts, and my love
for this world. I have met a fate worse than the death
penalty and now I must deal with it. 

I hope this test has convinced you of my honesty.
There is nothing more I have to offer other than
my word. Seek the truth, officer. Always.
