Isn't this fun! Much easier than looking
around intimate and personal files to try
to find clues to passwords, huh?

Allow me to continue.

After a few months, I started to get the hang
of the job. Make a funny looking graph, grab 
the warrant, snoop on some desktops, get
to live another day. 

Actually - between you and me - I was 
extractingthis one beautiful European babe 
named Roxy. She was hot, I mean fucking 
smokin'. Get this, I actually used the info
on her desktop to pretend like I was 
interested in all this shit she liked! 
19th century literature and wax candles.
Who would have known the best way into a 
woman's heart is through her computer? 
I didn't. Just, promise you won't tell 
anyone okay?

I was a disgusting pig, using the personal
drama of people's stupid fucking lives to
feed my ego. But, you know, it feels so 
damn good!

But c'mon, admit it. You get off on all
of this. You're just as guilty as I was.

Go on, admit your guilt.
