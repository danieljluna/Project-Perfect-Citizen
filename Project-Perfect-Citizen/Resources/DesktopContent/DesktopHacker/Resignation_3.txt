Isn't this fun! Much easier than looking
around personal files trying to figure
out passwords, huh?

Allow me to continue.

After a few months, I started to get the hang
of the job. Make a funny looking graph, grab 
the warrant, snoop on some desktops, get
to live another day. 

Actually - between you and me - I used my
job to get a date with this hot European
chick. I'm not lying!
 
One afternoon, I was extracting this one 
beautiful babe named Roxy. And she was hot, 
I mean fucking smokin'. Get this, I actually
used the info on her desktop to pretend 
like I was interested in all this shit she 
liked! I'm not fuckin' lying, officer!
19th century literature and wax candles.
I can't make this shit up. We banged on the 
first night. Who would have known the best 
way into a woman's heart was through her 
computer? 

What a disgusting pig I was - using the 
personal information of others to get what
I wanted. But you know the feeling! Right?
Sometimes you just can't help yourself!

C'mon! You get off on all of this just as 
much as I did. Really, you don't? 
No, no, no don't lie to me. Remember the
trust bond we made a little while ago?

Admit it, you're just as guilty as I was.
