Hello, DCPS employee. Quite an 
interesting desktop extraction, 
so far, is it not? How do you
like your new desktop, hm?

Allow me to introduce myself. I am
Isaac Durov, otherwise known as 
Employee-1527. I held your position
two years before you joined. However,
I was forced to join the force after
the DCPS had found out that I had
broken into the SecureNet mainframe.
Weak security protocols can be such
a bitch, can't they?

You'll have to excuse me, but at the
time of writing this, I can't help
but find this a rather cathartic
experience - you know - talking to
someone I know so little of.

I'm sure you have many questions. As
did I before I knew the truth. 
So, oh most majestic and righteous
DCPS office, allow me to take control
of this desktop extraction for a little
as I take you on a little journey through
time.

Please, parse through my old 
terminal. I mean, it's what you're 
best at, isn't it?

Of course, I'll need to know that you
trust me before we can move on.
