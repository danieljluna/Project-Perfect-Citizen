Hello, DCPS employee. Quite an interesting 
desktop extraction so far, is it not? 
How do you like your new desktop?

I apologize for my rudeness. Allow me to 
introduce myself. I am Isaac Durov, 
otherwise known as previous DCPS 
Employee-1527. I actually held your position
two years before you joined. Isn't that
cool?

However, unlike you, I was forced
I was forced to join the DCPS after
they had found out that I had
broken into the SecureNet mainframe.
Long story short, they gave me the 
option to either work for them or 
face the electric chair - you know, 
bzzt! haha. I wonder why you're here.
But we'll get to that later.

You must be so confused right now!
But don't worry. Just relax and allow me 
take you on a little journey through time. 
Oh, and please parse through this
terminal as you like. I mean, it's what
you're best at, isn't it?

Now in order to make sure we're on the
same page, I'll need to know you can be 
trusted. So go ahead and type into the
password prompt on the first folder that 
you trust me. Don't be afraid with what
you find!
