I ... I'm sorry I raised my voice.

Oh christ, now I'm crying. See what you
made me do?

Let me collect myself....


































Alright. I'm ready. Boy this is getting
tough. 

By now I was at the top of the throne. 
And with the precedent set by this leak, I
was now arresting people who even thought of
betraying the DCPS. Could my growing thirst
for power ever be quenched? 
Where could I go now? Nowhere.































Except one place. And I'm afraid I can't
tell you. For this is where my story at 
the DCPS ends. It is the reason I left 
and the reason I will never return. 

Officer, between you and me, you're the only
one who has ever come this far. In fact,
you're the only person that I've spoken to
since I've left. You're so kind. And honest.
And we have so much in common. I ... I can't 
imagine a moment without you. Officer... 
I think I'm beginning to fall in love with 
you. Yes, yes. You and I are meant to be 
together. Yes, you! Oh happy joy!

So tell me Officer, do you love me too?

Please, I've gone through enough.
Don't make me upset again.
