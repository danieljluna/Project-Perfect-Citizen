    So you are the new personnel here at the DCPS?
    Well you are going to enjoy your time here, I know
    it. Anyways, I'm JP and I am your boss here.
    
    So the first thing your should do is to open the
    Graph application and start your first assignment.
            
    We have suspicions on a group of people and it is
    your job to look through these suspects's sms
    messages and find the main conductor, the one who
    seems to spew the most suggestive content.
            
    Once you find your person, we will give you
    persmision to look into his desktop. Once inside,
    you will find content that will prove their
    actions. Also, if your bust them, don't worry 
    about the them, they are going to a special place.
            
    With every bust, we get closer to the goal of
    achieving the Perfect Citizen.
            
    JP"
