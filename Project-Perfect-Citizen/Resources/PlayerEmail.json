    So you are the new personnel here at the DCPS?
    Well you are going to enjoy your time here, I know
    it. Anyways, I'm JP and I am your boss here.
    
    First objective is to open the Graph application
    and start your first assignment.
            
    We have suspicions of these groups of people and
    it is your job to look through these poeple's sms
    messages and find the main conductor, the one who
    seems to spew the most suggestive content.
            
    Once you find your person, we will give you
    persmision to look into his desktop. Once inside,
    find content that will prove their impure actions.
    Don't worry about the them, they are going to a 
    special place.
            
    With every bust, we get closer to our goal of the
    Perfect Citizen.
            
    JP"
