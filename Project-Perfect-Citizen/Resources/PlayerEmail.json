    Project Perfect Citizen is the first extensive
    program initiated by the Department of Cyber
    Police and Security tasked with the job of
    detecting and eradicating cyber criminal
    threats within our great nation's network. 
    This network, the SecureNetwork, is a series
    of interconnected links between every
    electronic telecommunications device
    internationally that controls the channels
    through which information is passed on."

    next few days and don't worry if things start to
    seem overwhelming, I'm sure your first

    So you are the new personnel here at the DCPS?
    Well you are going to enjoy your time here, I
    know it. Anyways, I'm JP and I am your boss 
    here.
    
    So the first thing our should do is to open the
    Graph application and start your training.  We
	have a series of simulations designed to quickly 
	get you up to speed with our systems.
    
    Pretty soon you'll be busting cyber criminals left
	and right along side our best agents.  Just
	remember, with every successful takedown we get 
	closer to achieving the goal of \"Perfect Citizen\"
