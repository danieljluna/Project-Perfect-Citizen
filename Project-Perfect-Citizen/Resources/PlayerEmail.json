    the next few days and don't worry if things 
    start to seem overwhelming, I'm sure your

    So the first thing you should do is to open the
    Graph application and start your training.  We
	have a series of simulations designed to quickly 
	get you up to speed with our systems.

    Pretty soon you'll be busting cyber criminals 
    left and right along side our best agents.
    Just remember, with every successful takedown
    we get closer to achieving the goal of
    \"Perfect Citizen\"
