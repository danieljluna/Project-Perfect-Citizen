Everything is set up for linking. The only thing you need to do is make
sure VS can find SFML.

I am using SFML 2.3.2, and put the folder downloaded at:
	C:\SFML\SFML-2.3.2


Downloads:
	SFML 2.3.2:	http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.3.2/

I have linked dynamically, so you need to have the appropriate dlls in 
	the folder with the .exe. These are in the Git, so shouldn't be a 
	problem.
