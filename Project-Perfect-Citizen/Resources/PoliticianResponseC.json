    Guess we won’t know who accused Vincent of the
    voter fraud. Well I guess this is another
    glitch in the flagging algorithm. For every
    bad accusation, our system gets little bit
    smarter.
            
    Your next assignment is ready. Apparently
    there has been a “hacker” that broke into our
    security and has been manipulating with the
    databases. We suspect that he was a previous
    worker of ours. Find him and bust him."

    It is really frustrating seeing the system
    flag innocent people. Hopefully the engineers
    can actually create a good algorithm for once."
