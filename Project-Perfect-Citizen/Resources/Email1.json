    Lisa and I have been together for a little over
    a year now.
                
    She loves Proust, Nabokov, Kafka - and better
    yet she understands them in ways I'd never 
    imagined myself. Her analysis is full of sharp
    insight, and delightful twists. God I love her.
                
    I think have to tell her the truth.
                
    What if she hates me? If she leaves me...I don't
    know.

    Opening up to people you can trust is crucial to

    If you really love this woman, then she needs to
    know it all, even the things you'd rather leave
    in the past.

    I got in an argument with Lisa this morning.
    It's not the worst fight we've ever had, and yet
    I can't get it out of my head.
            
    We woke up in bed together. I began to kiss her
    neck. She told me to stop. And for a bit I did.
                
    After coming back from the shower I tried to
    kiss her again, but she kept pulling away from
    me. This time I stopped because she began to
    cry.
                
    She told me she had that dream again. The one
    she's been having every so often since I told
    her. She wouldn't say anything more after that.

    Lisa has been more distant now than ever. I
    can't help but feel it's related to telling her
    what my father did to me.
            
    So often survivors have their experiences
    trivialized, or invalidated. Usually talking
    about it gives me the opportunity to define my
    experience.
            
    With you and other Virtue members I can affirm:
    This did happen to me.  It was the fault of the
    adult. I was and am innocent.
            
    But with Lisa, she just worries I may do the
    same thing one day. And what really hurts is
    that I have the same concern.

    Finding this group is a real windfall for me. I

    my illness with others. In the interest of
    opening up communications, I'd like to share a
    bit about myself.
                
    I suffer from a twisted sexuality. Reviled by
    all. Delivered to me from my father.
        
    I can't help but be attracted to children.
                
    I've never acted on these desires, and I never
    will. Still I doubt my condition will ever go
    away.
                
    I've considered chemical castration, but I can't
    commit to it. So now, with the help of Virtue
    Community, I'll strive to lead a normal life.
                
    Thank you,
    Murphy Goodwin"
