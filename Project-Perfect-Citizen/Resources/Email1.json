    I'm glad you reached out to us. I'm Chandler
    Garvey, longtime member of Virtue Community. 
	I'll be your sponsor. It's my job to act as a
    resource when you need to talk to someone, 
	and to help you avoid environments where
	offending is possible.
            
    Many of us were abused in the past, and some of
    us are recovering abusers. This group began
    because traditional therapies, twelve step, and
    other behavioral rehabilitation programs don't
    work for people with our inclination.
        
    We are here to support one another, and stay on
    a righteous path.
                
    Self-control, community, family.

    Hi Chandler,
        
    Finding this group is a real windfall for me.
    I never thought I'd get the chance to talk
    about my illness with others. In the interest
    of opening up communications, I'd like to
    share a bit about myself.

    ’’’’’’’’’
    ’’’’’’’
            
    ’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’
    ’’’’’’’’’’
            
    I've never acted on these desires, and I
    never will. Still I doubt my condition will
    ever go away.
    
    ’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’

    Lisa and I have been together for a little over

    She loves Proust, Nabokov, Kafka - and better
    yet she understands them in ways I'd never
    imagined myself. Her analysis is full of sharp
    insight, and delightful twists. God I love her.
                
    I think have to tell her the truth.
                
    What if she hates me? If she leaves me...I 
	don't know.

	Opening up to people you can trust is crucial

	what you already know.
            
    If you really love this woman, then she needs 
	to know it all, even the things you'd rather 
	leave in the past.

    Doesn't make it any less daunting.
            
    Talking about my Father - talking about myself 
	- feels almost like I'm going through it all
    again.
            
    I'm full of that old anger. That old shame.

    We woke up in bed together. I began to kiss her
    neck. She told me to stop. And for a bit I did.
                
    After coming back from the shower I tried to
    kiss her again, but she kept pulling away from
    me. This time I stopped because she began to
    cry.
                
    She told me she had that dream again. The one
    she's been having every so often since I told
    her. She wouldn't say anything more after that.

		Hey,
            
    Be patient with her, and patient with yourself.
    No one's perfect.
            
    Remember: temperance is hard, but deeply
    valuable for men like us.
                
    You're not alone in this.

	Lisa has been more distant now than ever. I
    can't help but feel it's related to telling her
    what my father did to me.
            
    So often survivors have their experiences
    trivialized, or invalidated. Usually talking
    about it gives me the opportunity to define my
    experience.
            
    With you and other Virtue members I can affirm:
    This did happen to me.  It was the fault of the
    adult. I was and am innocent.
            
    But with Lisa, she just worries I may do the
    same thing one day. And what really hurts is
    that I have the same concern.

		Chandler,
            
    I gave her a few days to process what she's
    feeling, and when we finally talked it out,
    something new came to light.
            
    She's pregnant.
