    I'm glad you reached out to us. I'm Chandler
    Garvey, longtime member of Virtue Community.
    I'll be your sponsor. It's my job to act as a
    resource when you need to talk to someone, and
    to help you avoid environments where offending
    is possible.
            
    Many of us were abused in the past, and some of
    us are recovering abusers. This group began
    because traditional therapies, twelve step, and
    other behavioral rehabilitation programs don't
    work for people with our inclination.
        
    We are here to support one another, and stay on
    a righteous path.
                
    Self-control, community, family.

    cry.

    she's been having every so often since I told
    her. She wouldn't say anything more after that.

    So often survivors have their experiences
    trivialized, or invalidated. Usually talking
    about it gives me the opportunity to define my
    experience.
            
    With you and other Virtue members I can affirm:
    This did happen to me.  It was the fault of the
    adult. I was and am innocent.
            
    But with Lisa, she just worries I may do the
    same thing one day. And what really hurts is
    that I have the same concern.
