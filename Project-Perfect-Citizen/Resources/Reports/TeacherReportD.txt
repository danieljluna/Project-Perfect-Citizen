Case: #GH3418235923
Suspect: Murphy Goodwin
Investigator ID: #E25308456

The evidence supplied by the investigator to the DCPS was
more than enough to bring Mr. Goodwin to trial. The
prosecutor, armed with ample evidence, was able to easily
break down any plea of penitence or remorse that Mr. Goodwin
meekly put up. The judge, disgusted and seeing the potential
danger Mr. Goodwin might cause to his daughter, forbade
visitation in jail while the trial commenced. Mr. Goodwin,
separated from the only thing in his life he cared about and
facing an obvious guilty verdict, committed suicide in jail
before the jury's verdict was ever decided.

Case Closed.
