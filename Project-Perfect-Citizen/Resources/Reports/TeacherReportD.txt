Case: #GH3418235923
Suspect: Murphy Goodwin
Investigator ID: #E25308456

The evidence submitted to the DCPS showed no signs of guilt
and no court case was brought against Murphy. Even so, the
DCPS still had their suspicions of Murphy and decided to
monitor his internet traffic for 60 days after the end of
the initial desktop investigation. The DCPS's suspicions
proved correct when three weeks after, Murphy was arrested
for downloading pornographic images of children. He was
determined to be a threat to the safety of his child
Annalise, and was not forbidden from seeing her. He
committed suicide four months into his imprisonment after
repeated attempts to appeal to a judge to allow him to see
his daughter.
