There was not enough evidence to arrest Murphy but he is 
now on the DCPS watch list. Murphy continues to go to his 
council meetings in order to get help for his illness. 
Murphy says he no longer has those urges and is living 
a happy life with Lisa and Annalise. Murphy and Lisa 
are expecting their second child.
