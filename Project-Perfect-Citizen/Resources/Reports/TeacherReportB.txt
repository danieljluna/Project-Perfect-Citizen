Case: #GH3418235923
Suspect: Murphy Goodwin
Investigator ID: #E25308456

The evidence submitted to the DCPS by the investigator
convinced them to arrest Murphy. At the trial, the Jury
found the evidence to be inconclusive and Murphy was set
free. Having understood that he had escaped jail time by the
skin of his teeth, Murphy was finally convinced to reform.
Murphy has willingly restricted his own computer use and has
since lived a fairly stable life with his wife Lisa and his
daughter Annalise.
