Case: #GH3418235923
Suspect: Murphy Goodwin
Investigator ID: #E25308456

The evidence submitted to the DCPS was more than enough to
build a solid case against Mr. Goodwin. The trial ended
quickly with a jury quickly reaching a unanimous decision
of...guilty. Despite the quick verdict by the jury, the
judge believed that Mr. Goodwin was at least penitent and
allowed Mr. Goodwin to be visited by his family during his
minimum 15 year sentence. Despite his prison sentence, the
prison Psychiatrist observed Mr. Goodwin to be in good
spirits, claiming he no longer has to worry about ever
hurting his daughter again.
