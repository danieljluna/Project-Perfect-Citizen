Case: #FJ5953706858
Suspect: David Finley
Investigator ID: #E25308456

The DCPS alerted local authorities to David and warned
them of a potential bomb threat after the Desktop 
Extraction. Unfortunatley, David had a police radio 
scanner, and he detonated bombs at a bank once he knew
the police were looking for him. David and 8 others 
died in the explosion, with 43 others injured.
Continued governmental support for the DCPS is uncertain.
