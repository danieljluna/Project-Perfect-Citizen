Case: #KJ4890549726
Suspect: Vincent Sharp
Investigator ID: #E25308456

Vincent Sharp's alleged voter fraud was shortly dismissed
after no evidence of it. Vincent spends the next 4-years as
the governor of Texas but with historically low approval
ratings and thus could not be hired for another term.
