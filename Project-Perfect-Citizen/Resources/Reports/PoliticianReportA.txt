Vincent Sharp’s alleged voter fraud was shortly dismissed
after no evidence of it. Vincent spends the next 4-years as
the governor of Texas but with historically low approval
ratings and thus could not be hired for another term. Marie
Sharp dies while Vincent was in office. Rosemary Sharp
continues being in hospice care.
