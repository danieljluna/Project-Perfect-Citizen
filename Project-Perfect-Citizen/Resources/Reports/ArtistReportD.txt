Case: #FJ5953706858
Suspect: David Finley
Investigator ID: #E25308456

The DCPS decided to keep an eye on David Finley and
postpone serious action until they could gather more
evidence. Unfortunately, David detonated bombs at 
multiple banks later that week, killing himself and
19 others. Initial reports suggest 200 injured.
Word inside the government is that the DCPS may be
replaced by a program with a broader reach.
