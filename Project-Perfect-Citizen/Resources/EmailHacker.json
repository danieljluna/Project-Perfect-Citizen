    Project Perfect Citizen is the first extensive
    program initiated by the Department of Cyber
    Police and Security tasked with the job of
    detecting and eradicating cyber criminal
    threats within our great nation's network.
    This network, the SecureNetwork, is a series
    of interconnected links between every
    electronic telecommunications device
    internationally that controls the channels
    through which information is passed on."

    So you are the new personnel here at the DCPS?
    Well you are going to enjoy your time here, I
    know it. Anyways, I'm JP and I am your boss
    here.
        
    So the first thing our should do is to open
    the Graph application and start your training.
    We have a series of simulations designed to
    quickly get you up to speed with our systems.
                
    Pretty soon you'll be busting cyber criminals 
    left and right along side our best agents.
    Just remember, with every successful takedown
    we get closer to achieving the goal of

    I'm sure they've told you I've gone rogue;
    that I'm a threat to the DCPS as well as
    national security.
            
    I'm sure they've told you I've erased
    high-security data, actions consistent with
    digital terrorism.
            
    I'm sure they've told you that I'm beyond
    saving.
            
    And they're right. What they haven't told you
    is why.
