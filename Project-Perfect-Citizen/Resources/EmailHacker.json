    I'm sure they've told you I've gone rogue;
    that I'm a threat to the DCPS as well as
    national security.
            
    I'm sure they've told you I've erased
    high-security data, actions consistent with
    digital terrorism.
            
    I'm sure they've told you that I'm beyond
    saving.
            
    And they're right. What they haven't told you
    is why.
