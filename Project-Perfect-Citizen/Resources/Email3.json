    Hey Vincent, It's your campaign manager again.
    I have to be straight with you, our chances
    dont look good. I know its been neck and neck
    this entire campaign but this district has
    traditionally against you and the values you
    represent. If we want to have any chance of
    winning, we really need to get the youth vote
    off the couch and into the voting offices. I
    left a copy of a new speech our writers
    whipper up for you to hopefully put a fire
    under the millenials. Hope it works... its our
    only shot at winning this. Id say its one in a
    million though..."

    Dont celebrate just yet. We at the FEC just
    received compelling evidence that you and your
    staff committed voter fraud. You do know the
    repercussions of such an accusation don't you?
    Expect to be contacted by the FCC and see the
    story in the papers tomorrow. I'd prepare a 
    team if I were you. Youâ€™re going to need some
    sort of guardian angel to get out of this
    Vincent.
                
    Sincerely,
    A little bird at the FEC
                
    P.S. Why am I 'helping' you? Well, let's just 
    say I was a friend of your fathers back in the
    day."
