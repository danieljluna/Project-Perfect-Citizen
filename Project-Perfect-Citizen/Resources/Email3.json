    Take this with a grain of salt, but it looks
    like the latest polls have us down 7% vs.
    McConnelly. We've been campaigning hard all
    season, and I'm not sure what to make of this.
    Don't let it get to you though sir, these
    sorts of predictive numbers aren't always on
    the mark.

    I understand we've reached the fever pitch of
    your campaign. And that would align with the
    episodes of anxiety you contacted me about.
            
    Stress can be a difficult thing to navigate,
    especially when one is being thrust into the
    public eye every moment expected to give off
    nothing but confidence. In the coming days
    you'll likely not have the time to speak
    confidentially with me, or with any other
    professional. But that doesn't mean you cannot
    be helped through these attacks.
            
    One exercise I highly recommend whenever
    you're getting short of breath, or beginning
    to feel negative emotions building up is to
    write it all down.
            
    Start a journal. Put down what you feel. Allow
    yourself the luxury of reflecting on your
    thoughts and emotions after the fact.
            
    I believe doing this will help you cope.

    Congratulations on attaining your new seat
    within Congress.
            
    Given the status of your new work, you'll be
    privy to highly sensitive material. As you
    know in recent months there's been some stir
    over email security, and in order to keep your
    files, and our governments information in the
    right hands, we ask that you use our secure
    encrypted messaging system: Albatross.
            
    It's essentially the same as your email
    client, except that it's communications stay
    within the Senate networks, and thus are safer
    from outside meddling.
            
    Thank you for your compliance."

    I'm sorry to bear such poor news so soon after
    you won your seat. But this is urgent.
            
    In fact, I could lose my job for telling you
    this, but I owe you, so here it is:
                
    Within 48 hours the Federal Election
    Commission will open a public investigation
    against you, under the suspicion that you won
    the election through fraudulent means.
                
    I don't have anything solid, but by the looks
    of things you are about to be in hot water.
                
    Good luck,
