	Project Perfect Citizen is an innovative interactive narrative experience 
	that addresses government surveillance in the modern
	digital age. In this alternate-day dystopia, the player takes on the role
	of a no-name employee at the Department of Cyber Police and Security: a
	division of the government tasked with monitoring all domestic communications 
	within &quot;The Nation&quot;. After obtaining a warrant from an automated database
	extraction system, the player is granted access to their target&#39;s Desktop
	in order to collect incriminating evidence to prove the target&#39;s guilt.
	But when the line between criminality and the everyday struggle is blurred,
	the player must look to their own conscience to arrest or exonerate the
	targets he or she is surveilling.  In all, Perfect Citizen seeks to take the
	player on a thought provoking journey through the personal lives of imperfect
	citizens in order to push the bounds of games as a storytelling medium
	and create a tense yet intimate gameplay experience that directly engages
	with the conversation of privacy and security. 	<br>
